Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-masses of the two fragments, $m_1$ and $m_2$. We are given:\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The more massive fragment ($m_1$) is twice as massive as the other ($m_2$): $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\nSubstitute the first relation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99 M$\n$m_2 = 0.33 M$\n\nNow, find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33 M) = 0.66 M$\n\nNext, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe Q-value of the fission is the energy released, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_{total} = T_1 + T_2$). It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$, where $p$ is the momentum.\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be $p$.\n$p_1 = p_2 = p$\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n*   $T_{1, class} = p^2 / (2m_1)$\n*   $T_{2, class} = p^2 / (2m_2)$\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1, class}}{T_{2, class}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33 M}{0.66 M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2, class} = 2 T_{1, class}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the Q-value:\n$T_{1, class} + T_{2, class} = Q$\n$T_{1, class} + 2 T_{1, class} = Q$\n$3 T_{1, class} = Q$\n$T_{1, class} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1, class} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest-mass ($m$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n\nSince the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2 = p$), we have:\n$(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = T_2^2 + 2T_2m_2c^2$\n\nSubstitute $T_2 = Q - T_1$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)m_2c^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = (Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2) + (2Qm_2c^2 - 2T_1m_2c^2)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. Now, we group the terms with $T_1$:\n$2T_1m_1c^2 + 2QT_1 + 2T_1m_2c^2 = Q^2 + 2Qm_2c^2$\n$T_1 (2m_1c^2 + 2m_2c^2 + 2Q) = Q^2 + 2Qm_2c^2$\n$T_1 (2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q) = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nNow, solve for $T_1$ (which is the correct relativistic value, $T_{1, rel}$):\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2((m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + Q)}$\n\nPlug in the values we found earlier:\n*   $Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2(297 \\text{ GeV} + 3 \\text{ GeV})}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 (3 + 198)}{2(300)} \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_{1, rel} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and the less massive is `m2`.\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nTherefore:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n\nThis gives us the relationship:\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`(0.66 * M) * T1_classical = (0.33 * M) * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\nSubstituting `T2_classical`:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nFor the relativistic case, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where total energy `E = T + mc^2`.\nThis can be rearranged to find the momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2`\n\nWe know `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, so `T2 = 3 - T1`. We also have the rest-mass energies `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert this value to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Initial Values:** Set up the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `E_M`, in GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Masses:** Use the given relationships (`m1 = 2*m2` and `m1 + m2 = 0.99*M`) to determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n3.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):** The total kinetic energy released, `Q`, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical):** In the non-relativistic approximation, the total kinetic energy `Q` is shared between the fragments inversely proportional to their masses. We will calculate the kinetic energy `T1` for the more massive fragment (`m1`).\n5.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic):** Using the principles of energy and momentum conservation in special relativity, we will derive and calculate the correct kinetic energy `T1` for the more massive fragment. The total energy of the first fragment (`E1`) can be found using the formula: `E1 = ( (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ) / (2 * M*c^2)`. The kinetic energy is then `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2`.\n6.  **Find the Difference:** Calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values of `T1`.\n7.  **Convert to MeV and Conclude:** Convert the result from GeV to MeV and select the corresponding option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define Initial Values\n# Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus in GeV\nE_M_GeV = 300.0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n# We have two equations:\n# 1) m1c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 2) m1c2 = 2 * m2c2\n# Substitute (2) into (1):\n# 2 * m2c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 3 * m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\nm2c2_GeV = (0.99 * E_M_GeV) / 3.0\nm1c2_GeV = 2.0 * m2c2_GeV\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n# Q is the energy released, which becomes the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\nQ_GeV = E_M_GeV - (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n# In classical mechanics, momentum p is conserved (p1=p2=p), and T = p^2/(2m).\n# So, T1/T2 = m2/m1.\n# Also, T1 + T2 = Q.\n# This leads to T1 = Q * m2 / (m1 + m2).\n# In terms of rest-mass energies: T1 = Q * m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2)\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV * m2c2_GeV / (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic)\n# From relativistic energy-momentum conservation for a two-body decay from rest:\n# The total energy of the first fragment is E1 = (E_M^2 + (m1c2)^2 - (m2c2)^2) / (2 * E_M)\nE1_GeV = (E_M_GeV**2 + m1c2_GeV**2 - m2c2_GeV**2) / (2 * E_M_GeV)\n# The kinetic energy is T1 = E1 - m1c2\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1_GeV - m1c2_GeV\n\n# Step 6: Find the Difference\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\n\n# Step 7: Convert to MeV and Print the Result\n# 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Initial rest-mass energy (M*c^2): {E_M_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2): {m1c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2): {m2c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Total kinetic energy released (Q): {Q_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is {difference_MeV:.2f} MeV.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 54\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, let's call their rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say $m_1$ is the more massive fragment, so $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy ($Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$):\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times Mc^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times Mc^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n$Q = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final rest energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1 + m_2)c^2$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (0.99M)c^2 = 0.01Mc^2$\n\nUsing the given value $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n$Q = 0.01 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments:\n$T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let $p_{cl}$ be the magnitude of the classical momentum for each fragment.\n    $p_1 = p_2 = p_{cl}$\n*   **Kinetic Energy:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n    *   $T_{1,cl} = p_{cl}^2 / (2m_1)$\n    *   $T_{2,cl} = p_{cl}^2 / (2m_2)$\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    $\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p_{cl}^2 / (2m_1)}{p_{cl}^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    So, $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n*   **Solving for T1:** We know the total kinetic energy is $Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite: $p_1 = p_2 = p_{rel}$.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, where $E$ is the total energy ($E = T + mc^2$).\n    *   $E_1^2 = (p_{rel}c)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2$\n    *   $E_2^2 = (p_{rel}c)^2 + (m_2c^2)^2$\n*   **Solving for Energies:** From the relations above, we can equate the $(p_{rel}c)^2$ terms:\n    $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    $E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (m_1^2 - m_2^2)c^4$\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy was $Mc^2$. The final total energy is $E_1 + E_2$.\n    $E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   **Finding E1:** Substitute the known values into the momentum equation:\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = (198 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (99 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403$\n    $E_1 - E_2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n    1.  $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n    2.  $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n    Add the two equations to solve for $E_1$:\n    $2E_1 = 300 + 98.01 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   **Finding T1:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    $T_{1,rel} = E_1 - m_1c^2$\n    $T_{1,rel} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical value.\nDifference = $T_{1,rel} - T_{1,cl}$\nDifference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1.000 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\nDifference = $0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also means their rest-mass energies are related by `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = (m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n*   `E_final_rest = 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`\n*   Substitute (2) into (1): `(2 * m2c^2) + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   `3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV` => `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   From this, `m1c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n*   `p1 = p2`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since `p1 = p2`, we have `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n*   `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   Substituting `m1 = 2*m2`: `(2*m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical` => `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc²) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   Substituting for E: `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding and simplifying gives the relation for momentum: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2c^2)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m1c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`.\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`.\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out.\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`.\n*   `600*T1 = 603`.\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6.

Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of rest mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T₁` and `T₂` and momenta `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments\n\nThe problem states:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow, find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, convert these masses into their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy equals the final total energy (rest-mass energy + kinetic energy).\n\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + m₂c²) + (T₁ + T₂)`\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the fragments, `Q = T₁ + T₂`, is the energy released in the fission:\n`Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p²/2m`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\nTherefore:\n`T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)`\n`T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`\nSo, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas\n\nThe relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is also `E = T + mc²`.\nSubstituting `E` into the equation gives:\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2Tmc² + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `|p₁| = |p₂|`, so `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nWe know `T₁ + T₂ = Q = 3 GeV`, so `T₂ = 3 - T₁`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n`396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T₁_correct = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct `T₁` value and the classically calculated `T₁` value.\n\n`Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV`\n`Difference = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Energy Released\n\nFirst, we establish the rest masses of the initial nucleus (M) and the two fragments (m1 and m2).\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The problem states the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Sum of Fragment Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can solve for the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n2.  This gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`. Consequently, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n3.  Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total rest-mass energy of the fragments.\n*   **Q-value:** `Q = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`. Due to the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1 = p2 = p`).\n\n*   From `p² = 2*m1*T1` and `p² = 2*m2*T2`, we get `m1*T1 = m2*T2`.\n*   This gives the ratio of kinetic energies: `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, which means `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n*   Substituting this into the total kinetic energy equation: `T1 + 2*T1 = Q`, so `3*T1 = Q`.\n*   **Classical T1:** `T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Relativistic Calculation of T1\n\nFor the correct relativistic calculation, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `mc²`.\n\n*   Rearranging the energy-momentum relation gives `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), their squares are also equal: `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`.\n*   Therefore: `T1² + 2*T1*m1c² = T2² + 2*T2*m2c²`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Substituting this into the equation:\n    `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   Expanding and simplifying the equation:\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = T1² - 204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n*   **Relativistic T1:** `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Difference\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1.\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To convert this to MeV, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1.

Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\nWe know `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`:\n`(E1 - E2)(300) = (198)^2 - (99)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_rel = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**7.

Define the initial conditions and conservation laws\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State (after fission):**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2` and kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n    *   From the problem statement, `m1` is the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission equals the total energy after.\n        `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n        `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments and the total kinetic energy\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\n*   We have `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   Substituting this into `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, we get `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   This gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   And `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (`Q-value`) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies:\n*   `T_total = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1=p2`), we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, using the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\nThis leads to the relation: `(p*c)^2 = T * (T + 2*m*c^2)`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n\nWe substitute the known values (all in GeV):\n*   `T2 = 3 - T1`\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99`\n\nThe equation becomes:\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classically calculated value is:\n*   `Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy (M*c²):** 300 GeV\n*   **Relationship between fragment masses:** Let the masses of the two fragments be m₁ and m₂. We are given that one is twice as massive as the other, so let m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n*   **Sum of fragment masses:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    *   m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n*   **Solving for the masses:**\n    *   Substitute m₁ = 2 * m₂ into the sum: 2*m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n    *   3*m₂ = 0.99 * M  =>  m₂ = 0.33 * M\n    *   m₁ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n*   **Calculating the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁c²): 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂c²): 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (T₁ + T₂).\n\n*   **Q = M*c² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)**\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n*   Q = 3000 MeV\n\n### 3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\n*   **Conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂):**\n    *   The classical formula for kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n    *   Therefore, p = √(2mT).\n    *   √(2m₁T₁_classical) = √(2m₂T₂_classical)  =>  m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical.\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:**\n    *   Since m₁ = 2m₂, we have 2m₂ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical  =>  T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is Q = T₁_classical + T₂_classical.\n    *   3 GeV = T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 * T₁_classical.\n    *   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum and energy are related by the equation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where E is the total energy (E = T + mc²).\n\n*   **Relativistic momentum-energy relation:**\n    *   (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc².\n*   **Conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂ => (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²):**\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c².\n*   **Solving for T₁:**\n    *   We know T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substitute this into the equation.\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)\n    *   T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\n    *   396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁\n    *   396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    *   600T₁ = 603\n    *   **T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV.**\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n\n*   **Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)**\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass is M.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   We are given m₁ = 2m₂.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-masses of the fragments:**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  m₁ = 2m₂\n2.  m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M\n3m₂ = 0.99M\nm₂ = 0.33M\n\nNow, find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nBy conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the final rest-mass energy plus the kinetic energy of the fragments (T₁ + T₂).\n\nT₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\nT₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\nT₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the correct relativistic formulas:**\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment be 'p'.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². This can be rewritten as (pc)² = E² - (m c²)².\nSince E = T + mc², we have (pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc².\n\nFor the two fragments:\n*   (pc)² = T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²)\n*   (pc)² = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n\nEquating these two expressions:\nT₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n\nWe also know that T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\nT₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603\n396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603\n600T₁ = 603\nT₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\nThis is the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**5. Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/(2m).\nSince the momenta are equal (p₁ = p₂ = p):\n*   p² = 2m₁T₁_classical\n*   p² = 2m₂T₂_classical\n\nTherefore:\n2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical\nm₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical\n\nSince m₁ = 2m₂, we have:\n2m₂T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical\nT₂_classical = 2T₁_classical\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the same:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3T₁_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical = 1 GeV.\n\nThis is the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n\nDifference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert the difference to MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Determine Rest Masses and Total Kinetic Energy\n\nFirst, we are given the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus:\n*   $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. We are given two conditions:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: $m_1 = 2m_2$. We will call $m_1$ the \"more massive\" fragment.\n2.  The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\nFrom these two conditions, we can find the rest masses of the fragments. Substitute the first condition into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\nThen, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n\nNow we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 0.66(Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $m_2c^2 = 0.33(Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe total rest-mass energy of the fragments is $198 + 99 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energy is converted into the total kinetic energy (Q-value) of the fragments:\n*   $T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $T_{total} = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### 2. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn both classical and relativistic mechanics, since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   $|\\vec{p_1}| = |\\vec{p_2}| = p$.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   For the more massive fragment: $T_{1,class} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$\n*   For the less massive fragment: $T_{2,class} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n\nFrom this, we can establish a ratio of their kinetic energies:\n$\\frac{T_{1,class}}{T_{2,class}} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$\n\nSince $m_1 = 2m_2$, the ratio is:\n$\\frac{T_{1,class}}{T_{2,class}} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies T_{2,class} = 2T_{1,class}$.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy:\n$T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,class} + 2T_{1,class} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_{1,class} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,class} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment calculated classically is **1.000 GeV**.\n\n### 3. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest mass ($m$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. The total energy is also the sum of kinetic energy and rest-mass energy, $E = T + m_0c^2$.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$(T + m_0c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n$T^2 + 2Tm_0c^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tm_0c^2 = T(T + 2m_0c^2)$\n\nSince the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude ($p_1 = p_2$), their $(pc)^2$ values are also equal:\n$T_1(T_1 + 2m_1c^2) = T_2(T_2 + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nWe know:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $T_2 = T_{total} - T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} - T_1$\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation (let's omit the GeV units for clarity during calculation):\n$T_1(T_1 + 2 \\times 198) = (3 - T_1)((3 - T_1) + 2 \\times 99)$\n$T_1(T_1 + 396) = (3 - T_1)(3 - T_1 + 198)$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (3 - T_1)(201 - T_1)$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = 603 - 3T_1 - 201T_1 + T_1^2$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1 + T_1^2$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n$396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n$396T_1 + 204T_1 = 603$\n$600T_1 = 603$\n$T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} = \\frac{201}{200} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **1.005 GeV**.\n\n### 4. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for T1.\n$\\Delta T_1 = T_{1,rel} - T_{1,class}$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1.000 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nFinally, we convert this difference to MeV:\n$1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Q-value\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus and the two fragments.\n*   **Initial Nucleus (M):** The rest-mass energy is given as `M * c² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragments (m1 and m2):** Let `m1` be the more massive fragment. We are given two conditions:\n    1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we can solve for the masses of the fragments in terms of `M`:\n*   `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`  => `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   `m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1 * c² = 0.66 * (300 GeV) = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2 * c² = 0.33 * (300 GeV) = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe **Q-value** is the total kinetic energy released during the fission. This is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = (M * c²) - (m1 * c² + m2 * c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV = 3000 MeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the total kinetic energy `Q` is shared between the two fragments. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momentum.\n*   `p1 = p2` (in magnitude)\n\nThe classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`. Therefore, the ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = Q`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = Q`\n*   `T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3000 MeV / 3 = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nFor the correct relativistic calculation, we again use the conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy is conserved, and the magnitudes of the momenta are equal. The relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, which implies `(p1*c)² = (p2*c)²`.\n*   `E1² - (m1*c²)² = E2² - (m2*c²)²`\n*   `E1² - E2² = (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)²`\n*   `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c² - m2*c²)(m1*c² + m2*c²) `\n\nFrom the conservation of total energy, `E1 + E2 = M*c² = 300 GeV`. Plugging in the known values:\n*   `(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)`\n*   `E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n*   `2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n*   `E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy T1 is the total energy of the fragment minus its rest-mass energy (`T1 = E1 - m1*c²`).\n*   `T1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n*   `T1 = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1.\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Initial Values:** Set up the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (M*c^2) in GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Masses:** Use the given relationships (m1 = 2*m2 and m1+m2 = 0.99*M) to determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (m1*c^2 and m2*c^2).\n3.  **Calculate Q-value:** The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical):** Based on the conservation of momentum (p1 = p2) in classical mechanics (K = p^2 / 2m), the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass (K1/K2 = m2/m1). Use this ratio to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1_classical) from the total kinetic energy (Q).\n5.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1):** Based on the conservation of momentum in relativistic mechanics (E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2), we can establish a relationship between the kinetic energies and rest-mass energies of the fragments.

Understand the Initial State and Given Information**\n*   Initial nucleus: Mass M, at rest.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: E_M = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Process: Spontaneous fission into two fragments.\n*   Fragment rest-masses: m1 and m2. We are told one is twice as massive as the other. Let's define m1 as the more massive fragment, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   Mass relationship: The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial rest-mass. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses (or Rest-Mass Energies) of the Fragments**\nIt's easier to work with rest-mass energies (like m*c²) throughout the problem.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²)\n    2.  (m1 + m2)*c² = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    2*(m2*c²) + (m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n    3*(m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n    m2*c² = 99 GeV.\n*   Now, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1):\n    m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe total energy is conserved. The energy released as kinetic energy (Q) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n*   Initial Total Energy (nucleus at rest) = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Final Total Rest-Mass Energy = m1*c² + m2*c² = 198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   Total Kinetic Energy (Q) = Initial Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy\n    Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n    This 3 GeV of energy is shared as kinetic energy between the two fragments.\n\n**4. Relativistic Calculation of T1 (The Correct Value)**\nWe must use conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest (momentum = 0). Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero. The two fragments must fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n    |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest-mass (m) by: E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\n*   We can write this for both fragments:\n    *   E1² = (p*c)² + (m1*c²)²\n    *   E2² = (p*c)² + (m2*c²)²\n    Since `(p*c)²` is the same for both, we have:\n    E1² - (m1*c²)² = E2² - (m2*c²)²\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total final energy (E1 + E2) must equal the total initial energy (M*c²).\n    E1 + E2 = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Now we solve the system of equations. Rearrange the momentum equation:\n    E1² - E2² = (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n    (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n*   Substitute the known values: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, m1*c² = 198 GeV, m2*c² = 99 GeV.\n    (E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n    (E1 - E2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403\n    E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV.\n*   We now have a simple linear system:\n    1.  E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    2.  E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV\n*   Add the two equations to solve for E1:\n    2*E1 = 398.01 GeV\n    E1 = 199.005 GeV.\n*   The kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest-mass energy m1*c²:\n    T1 (correct) = E1 - m1*c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**5. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\nIn the classical approximation, we distribute the same total kinetic energy (Q = 3 GeV) using classical formulas.\n*   **Kinetic Energy Formula:** T = p² / (2m).\n*   From conservation of momentum, the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments.\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    T1 / T2 = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2.\n    So, T1 (classical) / T2 (classical) = 1/2, which means T2 (classical) = 2 * T1 (classical).\n*   The total kinetic energy is still Q = 3 GeV:\n    T1 (classical) + T2 (classical) = 3 GeV\n    T1 (classical) + 2 * T1 (classical) = 3 GeV\n    3 * T1 (classical) = 3 GeV\n    T1 (classical) = 1 GeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = T1 (correct) - T1 (classical)\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\n**7. Convert to Final Units (MeV)**\nThe answer options are in MeV.\n*   1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the two calculated values is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.\nInitial rest-mass energy, $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\nLet $m_1$ be the more massive fragment. We are given $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n\nThe sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n$m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\nSubstituting $m_1 = 2m_2$:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\nThen, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 0.66 M$.\n\nWe can now find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n-   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n-   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n$Q = E_0 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nThis is the total kinetic energy shared by the fragments: $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**1. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n$p_1 = p_2 = p$.\nThe classical relation between kinetic energy (T) and momentum (p) is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\nTherefore, $p^2 = 2m_1 T_{1,cl} = 2m_2 T_{2,cl}$.\nThis implies that the kinetic energy is shared in inverse proportion to the mass:\n$T_{1,cl} / T_{2,cl} = m_2 / m_1 = 1/2$.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n2.  $T_{2,cl} = 2 T_{1,cl}$\n\nSubstituting (2) into (1):\n$T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the classical kinetic energy is $T_{1,cl} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**2. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nConservation of momentum ($p_1 = p_2 = p$) still holds. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\nWe can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2$.\nSince the total energy is $E = T + m_0c^2$, we can expand this to $(pc)^2 = (T + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n\nEquating the momenta for both fragments:\n$(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nSubstitute $T_2 = Q - T_1 = 3 - T_1$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n$T_1^2 + 396 T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198 T_1)$\n\nCancel $T_1^2$ from both sides:\n$396 T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198 T_1$\n$396 T_1 = 603 - 204 T_1$\n$396 T_1 + 204 T_1 = 603$\n$600 T_1 = 603$\n$T_1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. The Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n$\\Delta T_1 = T_1(\\text{relativistic}) - T_1(\\text{classical})$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1.

Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nThe problem states:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: \\(m_1 = 2m_2\\).\n2.  The sum of the rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: \\(m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M\\).\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n\\(2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M\\)\nThen, \\(m_1 = 2 \\times (0.33 M) = 0.66 M\\).\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (fragment 1):\n    \\(m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (fragment 2):\n    \\(m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\nThe total rest-mass energy of the fragments is \\(198 + 99 = 297 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy is conserved. The initial energy (300 GeV) is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energies. The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is:\n    \\(Q = T_1 + T_2 = (\\text{Initial mass energy}) - (\\text{Final mass energy})\\)\n    \\(Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. The two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum:\n    \\(p_1 = p_2 = p\\).\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy \\(T_1\\)\n\nThe relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is \\(E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2\\). A particle's total energy is also the sum of its rest-mass energy and kinetic energy, \\(E = T + mc^2\\).\n\nFrom the momentum conservation, we can write:\n\\(p_1^2 = p_2^2\\)\n\\(\\frac{E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2}{c^2} = \\frac{E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2}{c^2}\\)\n\\(E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2\\)\n\nWe also know from energy conservation that the total final energy is the initial energy: \\(E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}\\). Thus, \\(E_2 = 300 - E_1\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(E_2\\) into the momentum equation:\n\\(E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (300 - E_1)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2\\)\n\nNow, plug in the values for the rest-mass energies (\\(m_1c^2 = 198\\) GeV, \\(m_2c^2 = 99\\) GeV):\n\\(E_1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E_1)^2 - (99)^2\\)\n\\(E_1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600E_1 + E_1^2) - 9801\\)\n\nThe \\(E_1^2\\) terms cancel out:\n\\(-39204 = 90000 - 600E_1 - 9801\\)\n\\(-39204 = 80199 - 600E_1\\)\n\\(600E_1 = 80199 + 39204\\)\n\\(600E_1 = 119403\\)\n\\(E_1 = \\frac{119403}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\nThe kinetic energy \\(T_1\\) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n\\(T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\\(T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV}\\).\n\n### 5. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy \\(T_{1, classical}\\)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is \\(T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\). Since the momenta are equal (\\(p_1 = p_2\\)), the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n\\(\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{99 \\text{ GeV}/c^2}{198 \\text{ GeV}/c^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\nSo, \\(T_{2,cl} = 2 T_{1,cl}\\).\n\nThe total kinetic energy is \\(T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\\(T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\\(3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\\(T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}\\).\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n\\(\\Delta T_1 = T_1 - T_{1,cl} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}\\).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1.

Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (`m₁c²`): `0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (`m₂c²`): `0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energies (`T₁` and `T₂`).\n\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + m₂c²) + (T₁ + T₂)`\n\nThe total kinetic energy released (`Q`) is:\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest, so by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is related to momentum `p` by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n\n*   `T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nTaking the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / (2m₁)) / (p² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁`\n\nSince `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio `m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 1/2`  => `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T₁\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²`. Since total energy `E = T + mc²`, we can write:\n\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2T(mc²) + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂ = p`), we have:\n`(pc)² = T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n\nWe know:\n*   `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n*   `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n*   `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n\nCancel the `T₁²` term from both sides:\n`396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is M*c² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   The more massive fragment is m₁: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe can determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (m₁c² and m₂c²) using the given relations.\n\n1.  Substitute m₁ = 2 * m₂ into the sum equation:\n    (2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n    3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\n    m₂ = 0.33 * M\n\n2.  Now, find m₁:\n    m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\n3.  Calculate their rest-mass energies:\n    *   **m₁c²** = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n    *   **m₂c²** = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies, due to the conservation of energy.\n\n*   Q = T₁ + T₂ = M*c² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/ (2m), where p is the momentum.\n\n*   From the conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: |p₁| = |p₂| = p_classical.\n*   Therefore, T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p_classical² / 2m₁) / (p_classical² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2.\n*   This gives us T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   Substituting T₂_classical: T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV.\n*   3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV**.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct Relativistic T₁\n\nFor the correct value, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)², where the total energy E = T + m*c².\n\n*   This can be rearranged to find the momentum: (pc)² = E² - (m*c²)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²).\n*   From the conservation of momentum, |p₁| = |p₂|, so (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n*   T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (m₁c²) = T₂² + 2 * T₂ * (m₂c²).\n*   We know T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁, m₁c² = 198 GeV, and m₂c² = 99 GeV.\n*   T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99).\n*   T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁).\n*   T₁² + 396*T₁ = T₁² + 603 - 204*T₁.\n*   Cancel T₁² from both sides: 396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁.\n*   (396 + 204) * T₁ = 603.\n*   600 * T₁ = 603.\n*   **T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV**.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n\n*   Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its total energy is its rest-mass energy, and its momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`. These fragments are in motion.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragments' masses:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`. (We'll call `m1` the more massive fragment).\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations:\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Now find `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies using the initial energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (`m2`): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy comes from the mass that was \"lost\" in the fission process (converted from mass energy to kinetic energy).\n*   Initial Energy = `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   Final Rest Energy = `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV`\n*   Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value) = `Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Relativistic Calculation of T1 (Correct Value)**\n\nWe must use two conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total kinetic energy is shared between the fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus was at rest (momentum = 0), so the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. We can rearrange this to solve for momentum: `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince `E = T + m*c^2` (Total Energy = Kinetic Energy + Rest-mass Energy), we can write:\n`(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\n\nNow, apply `|p1| = |p2|`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have a system of two equations for T1 and T2:\n1.  `T2 = 3 - T1`\n2.  `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**5. Classical Calculation of T1 (Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2 = p_classical`.\n*   So, `T1 = p_classical^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p_classical^2 / (2*m2)`.\n*   Let's find the ratio of the kinetic energies: `T1/T2 = (p_classical^2 / 2*m1) / (p_classical^2 / 2*m2) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio `m2/m1 = 1/2`. So, `T1/T2 = 1/2` or `T2 = 2*T1`.\n*   Now use the conservation of energy: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T2 = 2*T1`: `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`\n*   `3*T1 = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nFinally, find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.0 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)\n\n**1. Determine the initial and final rest-mass energies and the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Let the rest masses of the two fragments be `m1` and `m2`, with `m1` being the more massive fragment.\n*   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`. Therefore, their rest-mass energies are related by `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M:\n    `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    Multiplying by c^2, we get the sum of their rest-mass energies:\n    `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we can solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2` into the sum equation:\n        `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   Now find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n        `m1*c^2 = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV`.\n*   The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy:\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\n\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the fragments must also be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   So, `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   The total kinetic energy is `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T2_classical`:\n    `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the correct (relativistic) value of T1.**\n\n*   In special relativity, the relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c^2) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy is also `E = T + m*c^2` (kinetic energy + rest-mass energy).\n*   Substituting this into the relation: `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding and simplifying gives an expression for momentum: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   Since momentum is conserved (`p1 = p2`), we can equate their `(p*c)^2` values:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n*   We know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. We can now solve for the relativistic T1:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4.

Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, `E_i = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Total rest-mass energy of fragments = `0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Let the fragments have rest-mass energies `E_1` and `E_2`. We are given `E_1 = 2 * E_2`.\n*   `E_1 + E_2 = 297 GeV`\n*   `2 * E_2 + E_2 = 297 GeV` => `3 * E_2 = 297 GeV` => `E_2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, `E_1 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`. `E_1` is the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between initial and final rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Classical Approximation**\n*   By conservation of momentum (`p=mv`), the fragment with less mass has more velocity. The kinetic energies (`T = p^2/2m`) are inversely proportional to the masses.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV` => `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4.

Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus at rest with mass M.\n    *   Rest-mass energy: Mc² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   m₁ is the more massive fragment, with m₁ = 2m₂.\n    *   The sum of the fragment rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Masses and Energy Released\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. We have a system of two equations:\n1.  m₁ = 2m₂\n2.  m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M\n3m₂ = 0.99M\nm₂ = 0.33M\n\nNow, find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   **m₁c²** = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n*   **m₂c²** = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest energy and the total final rest energy.\n*   **Q** = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\nThis released energy is shared between the two fragments as kinetic energy: T₁ + T₂ = Q = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Relativistic Calculation (Correct T₁)\n\nIn spontaneous fission, the initial momentum is zero. Due to the conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. For relativistic particles, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². The kinetic energy (T) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy (T = E - mc²).\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation, we can write:\n(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²\n\nSince the momenta are equal (|p₁| = |p₂|), we have (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²:\nT₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²\n\nWe also know that T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁. Substituting this into the equation:\nT₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + T₁² + 594 - 198T₁\n\nSimplifying the equation by canceling T₁² from both sides:\n396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n600T₁ = 603\nT₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = **1.005 GeV**\n\nConverting to MeV:\nT₁ = 1.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = **1005 MeV**\n\n### 4. Classical Calculation (Approximate T₁)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T_cl = ½mv² and momentum is p_cl = mv. This gives the relationship p_cl² = 2mT_cl.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum (p₁_cl = p₂_cl):\n2m₁T₁_cl = 2m₂T₂_cl\nm₁T₁_cl = m₂T₂_cl\n\nSince m₁ = 2m₂, we have:\n2m₂T₁_cl = m₂T₂_cl\nT₂_cl = 2T₁_cl\n\nThe total kinetic energy is still Q = 3 GeV:\nT₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV\nT₁_cl + 2T₁_cl = 3 GeV\n3T₁_cl = 3 GeV\nT₁_cl = **1 GeV**\n\nConverting to MeV:\nT₁_cl = 1 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = **1000 MeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the Difference\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation:\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_cl = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, E = Mc² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   The more massive fragment is m₁. We are given m₁ = 2m₂.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments (m₁c² and m₂c²) using the given information:\n\n1.  The total rest-mass energy of the fragments is:\n    (m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n\n2.  We have a system of two equations:\n    *   m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n    *   m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)\n\n3.  Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n    3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV\n    **m₂c² = 99 GeV**\n\n4.  Now find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    **m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy:\n\nQ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\nQ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m), where p is the momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (p₁ = p₂ = p).\n\n*   T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)\n*   T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\nT₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2\nSo, T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁ Value\n\nFor the relativistic case, the relationship between kinetic energy (T), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc²) is given by (pc)² = T(T + 2mc²).\n\nAgain, from conservation of momentum, p₁ = p₂, which means (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n\n*   (p₁c)² = T₁(T₁ + 2m₁c²)\n*   (p₂c)² = T₂(T₂ + 2m₂c²)\n\nSetting them equal:\nT₁(T₁ + 2m₁c²) = T₂(T₂ + 2m₂c²)\n\nWe know:\n*   m₁c² = 198 GeV\n*   m₂c² = 99 GeV\n*   T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\nT₁(T₁ + 2 * 198) = (3 - T₁)((3 - T₁) + 2 * 99)\nT₁(T₁ + 396) = (3 - T₁)(3 - T₁ + 198)\nT₁(T₁ + 396) = (3 - T₁)(201 - T₁)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = 603 - 201T₁ - 3T₁ + T₁²\nT₁² + 396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁ + T₁²\n\nCancel T₁² from both sides:\n396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603\n600T₁ = 603\n**T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV**\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_classical\nDifference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine Rest Masses and Q-Value\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus and the two fragments.\n\n*   **Initial Nucleus (M):**\n    The rest-mass energy is given as M*c² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Fragments (m1 and m2):**\n    We are given two conditions:\n    1.  The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n        m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n        Multiplying by c², we get: m1c² + m2c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n    2.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other:\n        m1 = 2 * m2\n        In terms of energy: m1c² = 2 * (m2c²).\n\n    Now we solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n    Substitute the second condition into the first:\n    2*(m2c²) + m2c² = 297 GeV\n    3*(m2c²) = 297 GeV\n    **m2c² = 99 GeV** (the less massive fragment)\n\n    Then, for the more massive fragment (m1):\n    **m1c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\n*   **Q-Value (Total Kinetic Energy):**\n    The energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This energy is conserved and converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    Q = T1 + T2 = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²)\n    Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\n### 2. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m), where p is momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum is zero. The two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes: p1 = p2 = p.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy Ratio:** The kinetic energies of the fragments are:\n    T1_classical = p² / (2*m1)\n    T2_classical = p² / (2*m2)\n    The ratio is T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 99 / 198 = 1/2.\n    Therefore, T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n\n*   **Solving for T1_classical:** We use the total kinetic energy:\n    T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV\n    T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n    3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n    **T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the total energy is E = T + mc² and is related to momentum by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the initial nucleus is conserved.\n    E1 + E2 = Mc² = 300 GeV.\n    Here, E1 and E2 are the *total* energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the fragments.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, the momentum magnitudes are equal: p1 = p2 = p.\n    From the energy-momentum relation, we have (pc)² = E² - (mc²)².\n    Therefore, E1² - (m1c²)² = E2² - (m2c²)².\n\n*   **Solving for E1:** We have a system of two equations:\n    1. E1 + E2 = 300 GeV  => E2 = 300 - E1\n    2. E1² - (m1c²)² = E2² - (m2c²)²\n\n    Substitute E2 from the first equation into the second:\n    E1² - (198 GeV)² = (300 GeV - E1)² - (99 GeV)²\n    E1² - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1²) - 9801\n    Canceling E1² from both sides:\n    -39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 - 9801\n    -39204 = 80199 - 600*E1\n    600*E1 = 80199 + 39204\n    600*E1 = 119403\n    **E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV**\n\n*   **Solving for T1:** The relativistic kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy (T = E - mc²).\n    T1 = E1 - m1c²\n    T1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV\n    **T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV**\n\n### 4.

Understand the initial and final states**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_{initial} = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. We will call the more massive fragment '1' and the less massive fragment '2'.\n\n**2. Determine the rest masses of the fragments**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragment masses:\n*   One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other: $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations:\n1.  Substitute $m_1 = 2m_2$ into the second equation:\n    $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\n2.  Now find $m_1$:\n    $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33 M) = 0.66 M$.\n\nNext, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 M c^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 M c^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy ($Q$) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy.\n*   $Q = E_{initial} - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $Q = Mc^2 - (0.66M + 0.33M)c^2 = Mc^2 - 0.99Mc^2 = 0.01Mc^2$.\n*   Using the given value $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    $Q = 0.01 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: $Q = T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$, where $p=mv$ is the momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum, $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n*   **Kinetic Energies:** $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$.\n*   Since $m_1 = 2m_2$, the ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which means $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n*   **Solve for T1:** Substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    $T_1 + T_2 = Q \\implies T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    So, the classical kinetic energy is $T_{1,class} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**5.

(Here, $E = T + mc^2$ is the total energy).\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. We can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$.\n*   Since $p_1=p_2$, we must have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n    $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n*   Rearranging gives: $E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n*   Factor both sides: $(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (m_1c^2 - m_2c^2)(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$.\n*   Now, we plug in the known values:\n    *   $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = (198 \\text{ GeV} - 99 \\text{ GeV})(198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n    *   $(E_1 - E_2)(300) = (99)(297)$\n    *   $E_1 - E_2 = \\frac{99 \\times 297}{300} = \\frac{29403}{300} = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n    1.  $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n    2.  $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Adding the two equations gives: $2E_1 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV} \\implies E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   **Solve for T1:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy, $T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2$.\n    $T_{1,rel} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value ($T_{1,rel}$) and the classical approximation ($T_{1,class}$).\n*   Difference = $T_{1,rel} - T_{1,class}$\n*   Difference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\n*   Difference = $0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the initial state and parameters\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, E_M = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   It splits into two fragments with rest-masses m1 and m2.\n*   The more massive fragment is m1, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\nWe can write the mass relationship in terms of rest-mass energy:\n*   m1*c² + m2*c² = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   We also know m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²).\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n*   2*(m2*c²) + m2*c² = 297 GeV\n*   3*(m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n*   **m2*c² = 99 GeV**\n\nNow find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n*   **m1*c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This is due to the conservation of energy.\n*   Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)\n*   Q = M*c² - (m1*c² + m2*c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n*   Since the options are in MeV, let's convert Q: **Q = 3000 MeV**.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/ (2m), where p is the momentum.\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: |p1| = |p2|.\n*   Therefore, p1² = p2².\n*   2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical\n*   m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\n*   T2_classical = (m1 / m2) * T1_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n*   T1_classical + T2_classical = Q\n*   T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3000 MeV\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3000 MeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1000 MeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct T1 using Relativistic Dynamics\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)². The kinetic energy T is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy: T = E - m*c².\n*   This gives the relativistic momentum-energy relation: (p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²).\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, |p1| = |p2|, which means (p1*c)² = (p2*c)².\n*   T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)\n*   We know T2 = Q - T1 = 3000 MeV - T1. Let's substitute this and the mass-energy values (m1c²=198000 MeV, m2c²=99000 MeV).\n\nT1² + 2 * T1 * (198000) = (3000 - T1)² + 2 * (3000 - T1) * (99000)\nT1² + 396000 * T1 = (9,000,000 - 6000*T1 + T1²) + (594,000,000 - 198,000*T1)\n\nThe T1² terms on both sides cancel out:\n396,000 * T1 = 9,000,000 - 6,000*T1 + 594,000,000 - 198,000*T1\n396,000 * T1 = 603,000,000 - 204,000*T1\n\nNow, group the T1 terms:\n(396,000 + 204,000) * T1 = 603,000,000\n600,000 * T1 = 603,000,000\nT1 = 603,000,000 / 600,000\n**T1 (correct) = 1005 MeV**\n\n### 6. Find the difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the T1 value from the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = T1 (correct) - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nOf course. Here is my plan to solve the problem and the corresponding Python code.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Define Constants:** I'll start by defining the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (`M*c^2`), the mass ratio of the fragments (`m1/m2`), and the fraction of the initial mass that constitutes the final rest masses.\n\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Energies:** Using the given ratios and the total initial energy, I will set up and solve a system of equations to find the rest-mass energies of the more massive fragment (`E_m1`) and the less massive fragment (`E_m2`).\n\n3.  **Determine Total Kinetic Energy:** The total kinetic energy (`T_total`) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This is also known as the Q-value of the reaction.\n\n4.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (`T1_classical`):** I will use the principles of conservation of momentum in a classical framework. In this framework, the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass (`T = p^2 / 2m`). Since the fragments have equal and opposite momenta, I can find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T1_classical`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (`T1`):** I will again use the conservation of momentum. However, this time I'll use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`. By equating the squared momentum of both fragments and substituting the known values, I will solve for the correct relativistic kinetic energy, `T1`.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference:** Finally, I'll calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 (`T1 - T1_classical`) and convert the result from GeV to MeV to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_fission_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a physics problem about nuclear fission, calculating the difference\n    between relativistic and classical kinetic energy for one of the fragments.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define initial values from the problem description\n    # All energy values are in GeV for calculation convenience.\n    E_M = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy of nucleus M in GeV\n    mass_ratio_m1_m2 = 2.0  # m1 = 2 * m2\n    final_mass_fraction = 0.99  # m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\n    print(\"--- Problem Setup ---\")\n    print(f\"Initial rest-mass energy (M*c^2): {E_M} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Mass ratio (m1/m2): {mass_ratio_m1_m2}\")\n    print(f\"Final rest-mass fraction ((m1+m2)/M): {final_mass_fraction}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments (E_m1 and E_m2)\n    # E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M\n    # E_m1 = 2 * E_m2\n    # So, 2*E_m2 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M => 3*E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M\n    E_m_sum = final_mass_fraction * E_M\n    E_m2 = E_m_sum / (mass_ratio_m1_m2 + 1)\n    E_m1 = mass_ratio_m1_m2 * E_m2\n    \n    print(\"--- Fragment Properties ---\")\n    print(f\"Sum of fragment rest-mass energies (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2): {E_m_sum:.2f} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1*c^2): {E_m1:.2f} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2*c^2): {E_m2:.2f} GeV\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n    T_total = E_M - E_m_sum\n    print(\"--- Energy Release ---\")\n    print(f\"Total kinetic energy released (T1 + T2): {T_total:.2f} GeV\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n    # In classical mechanics, p = mv, T = 0.5*m*v^2 = p^2/(2m)\n    # Conservation of momentum means p1 = p2 (in magnitude)\n    # T1/T2 = (p^2/(2*m1)) / (p^2/(2*m2)) = m2/m1 = 1/mass_ratio_m1_m2\n    # T1 + T2 = T_total => T1 + T1*(m1/m2) = T_total\n    T1_classical = T_total / (1 + mass_ratio_m1_m2)\n\n    print(\"--- Classical Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Kinetic energy of massive fragment (T1_classical): {T1_classical:.4f} GeV\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate T1 using relativistic mechanics\n    # Relativistic momentum-energy relation: (pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2\n    # Total energy E = T + mc^2, so (pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*mc^2\n    # Conservation of momentum means (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2\n    # T1^2 + 2*T1*E_m1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E_m2\n    # Let T1 be the variable x.

This means its initial total momentum is zero (P_initial = 0) and its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy (E_initial = M*c^2).\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** M*c^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   **Fission Process:** The nucleus spontaneously splits into two fragments, which we'll call fragment 1 and fragment 2, with rest masses m1 and m2 respectively.\n*   **Mass Relation:** \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. It could mean m1 = m2 + 2*m2 = 3*m2, or it could be intended to mean m1 = 2*m2. Given that this is a physics problem with multiple-choice answers, one interpretation will likely lead to a correct option. We will test the interpretation m1 = 2*m2, assuming m1 is the more massive fragment.\n*   **Sum of Final Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** In this decay process, both total energy and momentum are conserved.\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) calculated using relativistic mechanics and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) mechanics. Let's call these T1_relativistic and T1_classical. The final answer is |T1_relativistic - T1_classical|.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Rest Masses and Total Kinetic Energy\n\nLet's use the given mass relations to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n\n1.  We have the system of equations:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2\n    *   m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    *   (2*m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n    *   3*m2 = 0.99 * M\n    *   m2 = 0.33 * M\n\n3.  Now find m1:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\n4.  Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments using M*c^2 = 300 GeV:\n    *   m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV\n    *   m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV\n\n5.  The total kinetic energy (T_total), also known as the Q-value, is the energy released from the conversion of rest mass.\n    *   T_total = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Sum of Final Rest-Mass Energies)\n    *   T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n    *   T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n    *   T_total = 3000 MeV\n\n### Step 3: Calculating T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The two fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be p.\n    *   p1 = p2 = p\n\n2.  **Relating Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical\n    *   p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical\n    *   Therefore, m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\n    *   T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2\n\n3.  **Distributing the Total Kinetic Energy:**\n    *   We know T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is T_total = T1_classical + T2_classical.\n    *   3000 MeV = T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 * T1_classical\n    *   T1_classical = 3000 MeV / 3 = 1000 MeV\n\n### Step 4: Calculating T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is E = T + m*c^2, and it's related to momentum by E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   Energy: E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV\n    *   Momentum: |p1| = |p2| = p\n\n2.  **Deriving T1_relativistic:** A standard formula for the energy of a decay product (fragment 1) in a 2-body decay from rest is:\n    *   E1 = [ (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ] / (2 * M*c^2)\n\n3.  **Plugging in the values:**\n    *   E1 = [ (300)^2 + (198)^2 - (99)^2 ] / (2 * 300)\n    *   E1 = [ 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ] / 600\n    *   E1 = [ 129204 - 9801 ] / 600\n    *   E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV\n\n4.  The relativistic kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n    *   T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2\n    *   T1_relativistic = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n    *   T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Final Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the two calculated values for T1.\n\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV\n*   Difference = 5 MeV\n\nThis matches option B. If we had used the m1 = 3*m2 interpretation, the result would have been 7.5 MeV, which is not an option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe problem asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy and the classically calculated kinetic energy of the more massive fragment produced in a spontaneous fission.\n\n### Initial and Final State Information\n\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: $M c^2 = 300$ GeV.\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   Mass relationship: $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   Sum of final rest masses: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the rest masses of the fragments\n\nWe can solve for $m_1$ and $m_2$ in terms of M:\nSubstitute $m_1 = 2m_2$ into the sum equation:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\nThen, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 0.66 M$.\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (fragment 1): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (fragment 2): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the classical approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by $T_{class} = p^2 / (2m)$.\nDue to conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta, so their momentum magnitudes are equal: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n$T_{1,class} = p^2 / (2m_1)$\n$T_{2,class} = p^2 / (2m_2)$\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to their masses:\n$\\frac{T_{1,class}}{T_{2,class}} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThis means $T_{2,class} = 2 T_{1,class}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is $Q = T_{1,class} + T_{2,class} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSubstituting the relation: $T_{1,class} + 2 T_{1,class} = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3 T_{1,class} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, $T_{1,class} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1\n\nRelativistic formulas must be used.\n*   Total energy: $E = T + mc^2$.\n*   Energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom conservation of energy:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nFrom conservation of momentum ($p_1 = p_2 = p$):\n$(pc)^2 = E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\nTherefore, $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n$E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (198 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (99 \\text{ GeV})^2$\nSince $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n$(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = 198^2 - 99^2 = (198-99)(198+99) = 99 \\times 297 = 29403 \\text{ GeV}^2$.\n$E_1 - E_2 = \\frac{29403}{300} \\text{ GeV} = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n1.  $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n2.  $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n$2E_1 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV} \\implies E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1,corr} = E_1 - m_1c^2$.\n$T_{1,corr} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n### Step 5: Find the difference\n\nThe difference is $\\Delta T_1 = T_{1,corr} - T_{1,class}$.\n$\\Delta T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe previous Python code confirmed this calculation, yielding `4.9999999999954525`, which is 5 MeV within floating-point precision.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1.

We are given that one is twice as massive as the other, so let `m1 = 2 * m2`. `m1` is the more massive fragment.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   We can express this in terms of rest-mass energy: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   Substituting the given values: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, it follows that `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n    *   `2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Energy Released (Q-value):\n*   The energy released in the fission, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n*   By conservation of momentum, the initial momentum (zero) must equal the final total momentum. This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `p1 = p2`.\n*   Therefore, `m1 * v1 = m2 * v2`.\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    *   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p1^2 / (2*m1)) / (p2^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n    *   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   `T1_classical = (1/2) * T2_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`:\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1:\n*   The relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest-mass energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this gives `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding this, we get `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore: `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Let's substitute this into the equation:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n*   Now, we simplify by canceling the `T1^2` terms:\n    *   `396 * T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    *   `(396 + 204) * T1 = 603`\n    *   `600 * T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n    *   `T1 = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference:\n*   Difference = (Correct T1) - (Classical T1)\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`) is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy:\n    `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV`.\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`, which implies `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   Now we solve the system of equations:\n    *   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2` into the sum equation:\n        `2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is:\n        `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) of the fragments comes from the conversion of mass into energy. It is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 Using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum.\n*   From the conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta, so `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   The ratio of their classical kinetic energies is:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\n    `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`:\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1 Value\n\nFor the relativistic case, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where total energy `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   This gives `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   Again, from momentum conservation `|p1| = |p2|`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, so `T2 = 3 - T1`. Substitute this and the mass-energies into the equation:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   Expand and solve for T1:\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + T1^2 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation for T1 is:\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Convert the result to Mega-electron Volts (MeV), knowing that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments and the total kinetic energy release.\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy (E_initial):** The problem states the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. Converting to Mega-electron volts (MeV) for convenience:\n    `E_initial = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV`\n\n*   **Final rest-mass energy (E_final_rest):** The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (m1 and m2) is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is:\n    `E_final_rest = (m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2 = 0.99 * 300,000 MeV = 297,000 MeV`\n\n*   **Individual rest-mass energies:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m1 = 2 * m2`).

Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n    `|p1_classical| = |p2_classical|`\n*   **Classical Relation:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Calculating T1_classical:**\n    *   From `p^2 = 2mT`, we can write `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n    *   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n    *   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `2 * m2 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`, which simplifies to `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3,000 MeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1,000 MeV`\n\n### 3.

Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** We have a nucleus of mass `M` at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial total energy is `E_initial = M*c^2` and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. These fragments will be moving to conserve momentum, so they will have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, respectively.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Masses of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\n*   The problem states a relationship between the masses: one fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll designate `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also means their rest-mass energies are related: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. In terms of energy: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   We can now calculate the rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2` into the sum: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` => `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy in the fission is called the Q-value. It's the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n    *   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T1` using the Classical Approximation**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n*   By conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = p2`.\n*   From the kinetic energy formula, we have `p = sqrt(2mT)`.\n*   Therefore, `sqrt(2*m1*T1_classical) = sqrt(2*m2*T2_classical)`, which simplifies to `m1*T1_classical = m2*T2_classical`.\n*   Using `m1 = 2*m2`, we get `2*m2*T1_classical = m2*T2_classical`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`. The less massive particle gets more kinetic energy.\n*   The total kinetic energy is `Q`: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy `T1`**\n\n*   In relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   Again, conservation of momentum means `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore: `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`. Let's substitute this and the mass-energy values (`m1*c^2 = 198` GeV, `m2*c^2 = 99` GeV) into the equation. For simplicity, we'll work in units of GeV.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    *   `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Now, we solve for `T1`:\n    *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   The correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero and its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\nThe nucleus undergoes fission, splitting into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\nWe are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate `m1` as the more massive fragment:\n`m1 = 2 * m2`\n\nThe sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n`m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nWe can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of M:\nSubstitute `m1 = 2*m2` into the second equation:\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow solve for `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest energy of `m1`: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * M*c^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of `m2`: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * M*c^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.

Let the magnitude of their momenta be `p`. `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nFrom this, we can write `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since total energy `E = T + m*c^2` (kinetic + rest energy), this becomes `(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we can set their squared momenta equal:\n`(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nFirst, we need to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. We are given two pieces of information:\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let their rest-mass energies be `m1c^2` and `m2c^2`. We can write this relationship as: `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`.\n*   The sum of their rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy (`Mc^2 = 300 GeV`): `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow we solve this system of two equations:\n1.  Substitute the first equation into the second: `(2 * m2c^2) + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n2.  Simplify to find the energy of the lighter fragment: `3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV`, which gives `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n3.  Use this to find the energy of the more massive fragment: `m1c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the difference between the initial rest energy and the sum of the final rest energies.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal magnitudes of momentum and travel in opposite directions (`p1 = p2`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Energies:** We can find the ratio of the classical kinetic energies:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p1^2 / 2m1) / (p2^2 / 2m2)`. Since `p1 = p2`, this simplifies to `m2 / m1`.\n    The mass ratio `m2/m1` is the same as the rest-energy ratio `m2c^2 / m1c^2`, which is `99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n    So, `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   **Solve for T1_classical:**\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (`p1 = p2`)** and the **relativistic energy-momentum relation** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2` gives us `E1^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2c^2)^2`.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy** states that the initial energy equals the sum of the final total energies (rest + kinetic): `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`. We can write `E2 = 300 - E1`.\n*   Now, substitute the known values into the momentum equation:\n    `E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2`\n    `E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801`\n*   The `E1^2` terms cancel. Rearrange the equation to solve for `E1`:\n    `600 * E1 = 90000 - 9801 + 39204`\n    `600 * E1 = 119403`\n    `E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n*   The correct kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1c^2`:\n    `T1_correct = E1 - m1c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classically approximated value is:\n*   Difference = `T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\nThe question's options are in MeV, so we convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Define Given Quantities**\n\n*   Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus, `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest, so its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n*   The fission products are two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Relation between fragment masses: `m1 = 2 * m2`. Fragment 1 is the more massive one.\n*   Sum of fragment rest masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nWe need to find the rest-mass energies `m1c²` and `m2c²`. We have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1c² = 2 * m2c²`\n2.  `m1c² + m2c² = 0.99 * Mc²`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2c² + m2c² = 0.99 * Mc²`\n`3 * m2c² = 0.99 * (300 GeV)`\n`3 * m2c² = 297 GeV`\n`m2c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find `m1c²` using equation (1):\n`m1c² = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies are:\n*   More massive fragment (m1): `m1c² = 198 GeV`\n*   Less massive fragment (m2): `m2c² = 99 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²) `\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate Kinetic Energy `T1` using Classical Approximation**\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (`p`).\n`p1 = p2 = p`\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`. The total kinetic energy `Q` is shared between the two fragments:\n`Q = T1_classical + T2_classical = p² / (2*m1) + p² / (2*m2)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is inversely proportional to their masses:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\nThis implies `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nSubstitute this into the equation for Q:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = Q`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate Kinetic Energy `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nWe again use the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`. The relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\nA particle's total energy is `E = T + mc²`, where `T` is its kinetic energy.\nFrom the energy-momentum relation, we can write the momentum as: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`:\n`T1² + 2 * T1 * (m1c²) = T2² + 2 * T2 * (m2c²) `\n\nWe also know that `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T1² + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)² + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n\nNow, solve for `T1`:\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1 = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value `T1` and the classical approximation `T1_classical` is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe python code confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial mass = M\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy = M*c² = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe can express the rest-mass energies of the fragments (m₁c² and m₂c²) in terms of the initial rest-mass energy (Mc²).\n\n*   From the given relations:\n    *   m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n    *   Since m₁ = 2 * m₂, it follows that m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²).\n\n*   Now, substitute the second equation into the first:\n    *   2*(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n    *   3*(m₂c²) = 297 GeV\n    *   m₂c² = 99 GeV\n\n*   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is:\n    *   m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (T₁ + T₂) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This is known as the Q-value of the reaction.\n\n*   Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Mc²) - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by T = p²/2m. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be 'p'.\n\n*   T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)\n*   T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)\n\nNow we can find the ratio of their kinetic energies:\n*   T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁ = m₂/(2m₂) = 1/2.\n*   This means T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy calculated in step 3:\n*   T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\n*   T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we must use the principles of conservation of four-momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy is E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV. The final total energy is E_final = E₁ + E₂, where E₁ = T₁ + m₁c² and E₂ = T₂ + m₂c² are the total relativistic energies of the fragments.\n    *   E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The magnitude of the momentum of the two fragments is equal, p₁ = p₂ = p. The relativistic relationship between total energy, momentum, and rest-mass energy is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   This gives (pc)² = E² - (mc²)².\n    *   Since the momenta are equal: E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²\n    *   E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²\n    *   (E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n    *   (E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) GeV²\n    *   (E₁ - E₂)(300) = (99)(297)\n    *   E₁ - E₂ = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV\n\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for E₁ and E₂:\n    1.  E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n    2.  E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV\n\n*   Adding the two equations gives:\n    *   2E₁ = 398.01 GeV\n    *   E₁ = 199.005 GeV\n\n*   The kinetic energy T₁ is the total energy E₁ minus the rest-mass energy m₁c²:\n    *   T₁ = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ and the classically calculated T₁.\n\n*   Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass is M.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `M*c² = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2*m₂`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T₁` and `T₂`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe can solve for the individual masses:\nSubstitute `m₁ = 2*m₂` into the sum equation:\n`2*m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n`m₂ = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`):\n    `m₁*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`):\n    `m₂*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy before fission must equal the total energy after fission.\n*   Energy before = `M*c² = 300 GeV` (since the nucleus is at rest).\n*   Energy after = `(m₁*c² + T₁) + (m₂*c² + T₂)`.\n\nSo, `M*c² = m₁*c² + m₂*c² + T₁ + T₂`.\nThe total kinetic energy `T_total = T₁ + T₂` released in the fission (also known as the Q-value) is:\n`T_total = M*c² - (m₁*c² + m₂*c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nTherefore, `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\nLet `p₁` and `p₂` be the magnitudes of the momenta of the fragments.\n`p₁ = p₂`\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p² / (2m)`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`), we have `p₁² = p₂²`.\n`2*m₁*T₁_cla = 2*m₂*T₂_cla`\n`m₁*T₁_cla = m₂*T₂_cla`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_cla / T₂_cla = m₂ / m₁ = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`.\nThis means `T₂_cla = 2 * T₁_cla`.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T₁_cla + T₂_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cla + 2*T₁_cla = 3 GeV`\n`3*T₁_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cla = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 6. Calculate T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\nThe total energy is also `E = T + m*c²`, where T is the kinetic energy.\nSubstituting this gives: `(T + m*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\nExpanding and rearranging for `(p*c)²`:\n`T² + 2*T*m*c² + (m*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n`(p*c)² = T² + 2*T*m*c² = T * (T + 2*m*c²)`.\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p₁ = p₂`, so `(p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)²`.\n`T₁_rel * (T₁_rel + 2*m₁*c²) = T₂_rel * (T₂_rel + 2*m₂*c²)`.\n\nWe have `T₂_rel = 3 - T₁_rel` (in GeV). Substitute this and the rest-mass energies:\n`T₁_rel * (T₁_rel + 2*198) = (3 - T₁_rel) * ((3 - T₁_rel) + 2*99)`\n`T₁_rel * (T₁_rel + 396) = (3 - T₁_rel) * (3 - T₁_rel + 198)`\n`T₁_rel² + 396*T₁_rel = (3 - T₁_rel) * (201 - T₁_rel)`\n`T₁_rel² + 396*T₁_rel = 603 - 3*T₁_rel - 201*T₁_rel + T₁_rel²`\n`T₁_rel² + 396*T₁_rel = 603 - 204*T₁_rel + T₁_rel²`\n\nCancel `T₁_rel²` from both sides:\n`396*T₁_rel = 603 - 204*T₁_rel`\n`600*T₁_rel = 603`\n`T₁_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 7. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\nDifference = `T₁_rel - T₁_cla`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus: E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV.\n    *   Initial momentum: P_initial = 0.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: m₁ = 2m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies T₁ and T₂, and momenta p₁ and p₂.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nFrom the given information, we can find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments:\n*   (m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300,000 MeV = 297,000 MeV.\n*   Since m₁ = 2m₂, we can write (2m₂ + m₂)c² = 3m₂c² = 297,000 MeV.\n*   Solving for m₂c², we get: m₂c² = 99,000 MeV.\n*   And for m₁c², we get: m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 198,000 MeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies, according to the principle of energy conservation.\n*   Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV = 3,000 MeV.\n\n### 4. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T₁\n\nIn classical mechanics, the conservation of momentum (P_initial = 0) means the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: p₁ = -p₂, so |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   The classical kinetic energy is given by T = p² / (2m).\n*   Therefore, T₁ = p² / (2m₁) and T₂ = p² / (2m₂).\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses: T₁ / T₂ = m₂ / m₁ = m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2.\n*   This implies T₂ = 2T₁.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: T₁ + T₂ = 3,000 MeV.\n*   Substituting T₂: T₁ + 2T₁ = 3T₁ = 3,000 MeV.\n*   This gives the classical value for T₁: **T₁ (classical) = 1,000 MeV**.\n\n### 5. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T₁\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we again use the conservation of momentum, |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum (p), energy (E), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   This can be rewritten as (pc)² = E² - (mc²)². Since the total energy is E = T + mc², we get (pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²).\n*   Since the momenta are equal: (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n*   T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²).\n*   We know T₂ = 3,000 - T₁. Substituting this and the mass-energy values into the equation:\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁(198,000) = (3,000 - T₁)² + 2(3,000 - T₁)(99,000)\n    *   T₁² + 396,000T₁ = (9,000,000 - 6,000T₁ + T₁²) + (594,000,000 - 198,000T₁)\n*   Simplifying the equation by canceling the T₁² terms on both sides:\n    *   396,000T₁ = 9,000,000 - 6,000T₁ + 594,000,000 - 198,000T₁\n    *   396,000T₁ = 603,000,000 - 204,000T₁\n*   Grouping the T₁ terms:\n    *   396,000T₁ + 204,000T₁ = 603,000,000\n    *   600,000T₁ = 603,000,000\n*   Solving for the relativistic T₁:\n    *   **T₁ (relativistic) = 603,000,000 / 600,000 = 1,005 MeV**.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\n*   Difference = 1,005 MeV - 1,000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided solutions.\n\n### **1. Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\nFirst, we establish the key values from the problem description. This is done consistently and correctly across almost all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. It is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relationship:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. The more massive fragment `m₁` is twice as massive as `m₂`, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`. This can be expressed in terms of energy as:\n    `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nUsing the relationships from Step 1, we can find the individual rest-mass energies and the total kinetic energy released (Q-value). This is a foundational step that the majority of candidates perform correctly.\n\n*   We solve the system of equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n    2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n*   Substituting the first into the second: `2 * m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which gives `3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the rest-mass energies of the fragments are:\n    *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (less massive fragment)\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment)\n*   The **Q-value** is the energy converted from mass to kinetic energy:\n    `Q = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    This `3 GeV` is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`).\n\n### **3. Classical Calculation of T₁**\n\nIn the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is shared in inverse proportion to the mass, due to the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`).\n*   `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\nThis calculation is consistently correct across the candidate solutions.\n\n### **4. Relativistic Calculation of T₁ (Correct Value)**\n\nThis is the most complex step, but the candidate answers show a strong consensus on the correct method and result. The relativistic relationship `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²` must be used.\nFrom conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`), we can equate the momentum terms for both fragments:\n`T₁² + 2*T₁*(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2*T₂*(m₂c²)`.\n\nSubstituting `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`:\n`T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)`\n`T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁`\n`600*T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\nThis result is also robustly confirmed by the alternate relativistic method using conservation of total energy, as seen in several candidate answers.\n\n### **5. Final Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and approximate values.\n*   Difference = `T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n*   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThere is a very strong consensus among the provided answers that the numerical result is 5 MeV. Although several candidates select the wrong final letter (e.g., A, C, or D), their step-by-step calculations almost universally arrive at the correct intermediate values and the final difference of 5 MeV. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are likely due to clerical errors or confusion over the option mapping, not errors in the physics calculation.\n\nThe correct difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-masses of the two fragments, $m_1$ and $m_2$. We are given:\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The more massive fragment ($m_1$) is twice as massive as the other ($m_2$): $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\nSubstitute the first relation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99 M$\n$m_2 = 0.33 M$\n\nNow, find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33 M) = 0.66 M$\n\nNext, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe Q-value of the fission is the energy released, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_{total} = T_1 + T_2$). It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$, where $p$ is the momentum.\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be $p$.\n$p_1 = p_2 = p$\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n*   $T_{1, class} = p^2 / (2m_1)$\n*   $T_{2, class} = p^2 / (2m_2)$\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1, class}}{T_{2, class}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33 M}{0.66 M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2, class} = 2 T_{1, class}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the Q-value:\n$T_{1, class} + T_{2, class} = Q$\n$T_{1, class} + 2 T_{1, class} = Q$\n$3 T_{1, class} = Q$\n$T_{1, class} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1, class} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest-mass ($m$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n\nSince the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2 = p$), we have:\n$(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = T_2^2 + 2T_2m_2c^2$\n\nSubstitute $T_2 = Q - T_1$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)m_2c^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1m_1c^2 = (Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2) + (2Qm_2c^2 - 2T_1m_2c^2)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. Now, we group the terms with $T_1$:\n$2T_1m_1c^2 + 2QT_1 + 2T_1m_2c^2 = Q^2 + 2Qm_2c^2$\n$T_1 (2m_1c^2 + 2m_2c^2 + 2Q) = Q^2 + 2Qm_2c^2$\n$T_1 (2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q) = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nNow, solve for $T_1$ (which is the correct relativistic value, $T_{1, rel}$):\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2((m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + Q)}$\n\nPlug in the values we found earlier:\n*   $Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2(297 \\text{ GeV} + 3 \\text{ GeV})}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 (3 + 198)}{2(300)} \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_{1, rel} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and the less massive is `m2`.\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nTherefore:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n\nThis gives us the relationship:\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`(0.66 * M) * T1_classical = (0.33 * M) * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\nSubstituting `T2_classical`:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nFor the relativistic case, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where total energy `E = T + mc^2`.\nThis can be rearranged to find the momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2`\n\nWe know `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, so `T2 = 3 - T1`. We also have the rest-mass energies `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert this value to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Initial Values:** Set up the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `E_M`, in GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Masses:** Use the given relationships (`m1 = 2*m2` and `m1 + m2 = 0.99*M`) to determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n3.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):** The total kinetic energy released, `Q`, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical):** In the non-relativistic approximation, the total kinetic energy `Q` is shared between the fragments inversely proportional to their masses. We will calculate the kinetic energy `T1` for the more massive fragment (`m1`).\n5.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic):** Using the principles of energy and momentum conservation in special relativity, we will derive and calculate the correct kinetic energy `T1` for the more massive fragment. The total energy of the first fragment (`E1`) can be found using the formula: `E1 = ( (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ) / (2 * M*c^2)`. The kinetic energy is then `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2`.\n6.  **Find the Difference:** Calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values of `T1`.\n7.  **Convert to MeV and Conclude:** Convert the result from GeV to MeV and select the corresponding option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define Initial Values\n# Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus in GeV\nE_M_GeV = 300.0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n# We have two equations:\n# 1) m1c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 2) m1c2 = 2 * m2c2\n# Substitute (2) into (1):\n# 2 * m2c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 3 * m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\nm2c2_GeV = (0.99 * E_M_GeV) / 3.0\nm1c2_GeV = 2.0 * m2c2_GeV\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n# Q is the energy released, which becomes the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\nQ_GeV = E_M_GeV - (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n# In classical mechanics, momentum p is conserved (p1=p2=p), and T = p^2/(2m).\n# So, T1/T2 = m2/m1.\n# Also, T1 + T2 = Q.\n# This leads to T1 = Q * m2 / (m1 + m2).\n# In terms of rest-mass energies: T1 = Q * m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2)\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV * m2c2_GeV / (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic)\n# From relativistic energy-momentum conservation for a two-body decay from rest:\n# The total energy of the first fragment is E1 = (E_M^2 + (m1c2)^2 - (m2c2)^2) / (2 * E_M)\nE1_GeV = (E_M_GeV**2 + m1c2_GeV**2 - m2c2_GeV**2) / (2 * E_M_GeV)\n# The kinetic energy is T1 = E1 - m1c2\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1_GeV - m1c2_GeV\n\n# Step 6: Find the Difference\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\n\n# Step 7: Convert to MeV and Print the Result\n# 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Initial rest-mass energy (M*c^2): {E_M_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2): {m1c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2): {m2c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Total kinetic energy released (Q): {Q_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is {difference_MeV:.2f} MeV.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 54\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, let's call their rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say $m_1$ is the more massive fragment, so $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy ($Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$):\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times Mc^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times Mc^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n$Q = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final rest energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1 + m_2)c^2$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (0.99M)c^2 = 0.01Mc^2$\n\nUsing the given value $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n$Q = 0.01 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments:\n$T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let $p_{cl}$ be the magnitude of the classical momentum for each fragment.\n    $p_1 = p_2 = p_{cl}$\n*   **Kinetic Energy:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n    *   $T_{1,cl} = p_{cl}^2 / (2m_1)$\n    *   $T_{2,cl} = p_{cl}^2 / (2m_2)$\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    $\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p_{cl}^2 / (2m_1)}{p_{cl}^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    So, $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n*   **Solving for T1:** We know the total kinetic energy is $Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**5.

Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also means their rest-mass energies are related by `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = (m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n*   `E_final_rest = 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`\n*   Substitute (2) into (1): `(2 * m2c^2) + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   `3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV` => `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   From this, `m1c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n*   `p1 = p2`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since `p1 = p2`, we have `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n*   `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   Substituting `m1 = 2*m2`: `(2*m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical` => `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Now use the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc²) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   Substituting for E: `(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding and simplifying gives the relation for momentum: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2c^2)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m1c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`.\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`.\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out.\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`.\n*   `600*T1 = 603`.\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n*   `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV:\n*   `Difference (MeV) = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of rest mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T₁` and `T₂` and momenta `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments\n\nThe problem states:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow, find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, convert these masses into their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy equals the final total energy (rest-mass energy + kinetic energy).\n\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + m₂c²) + (T₁ + T₂)`\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the fragments, `Q = T₁ + T₂`, is the energy released in the fission:\n`Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p²/2m`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\nTherefore:\n`T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)`\n`T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`\nSo, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas\n\nThe relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is also `E = T + mc²`.\nSubstituting `E` into the equation gives:\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2Tmc² + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `|p₁| = |p₂|`, so `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nWe know `T₁ + T₂ = Q = 3 GeV`, so `T₂ = 3 - T₁`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n`396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T₁_correct = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct `T₁` value and the classically calculated `T₁` value.\n\n`Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV`\n`Difference = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Energy Released\n\nFirst, we establish the rest masses of the initial nucleus (M) and the two fragments (m1 and m2).\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The problem states the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Sum of Fragment Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can solve for the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n2.  This gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`. Consequently, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n3.  Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total rest-mass energy of the fragments.\n*   **Q-value:** `Q = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`. Due to the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1 = p2 = p`).\n\n*   From `p² = 2*m1*T1` and `p² = 2*m2*T2`, we get `m1*T1 = m2*T2`.\n*   This gives the ratio of kinetic energies: `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, which means `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n*   Substituting this into the total kinetic energy equation: `T1 + 2*T1 = Q`, so `3*T1 = Q`.\n*   **Classical T1:** `T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Relativistic Calculation of T1\n\nFor the correct relativistic calculation, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `mc²`.\n\n*   Rearranging the energy-momentum relation gives `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), their squares are also equal: `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`.\n*   Therefore: `T1² + 2*T1*m1c² = T2² + 2*T2*m2c²`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Substituting this into the equation:\n    `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   Expanding and simplifying the equation:\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = T1² - 204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n*   **Relativistic T1:** `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Difference\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1.\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To convert this to MeV, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1.

Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) of the fragments comes from the conversion of mass into energy.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial Mass Energy) - (Final Mass Energy)`\n`Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n`p1 = p2 = p`\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5.

Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSo, `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_cl` and `p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_cl`.\nTherefore, `m1 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl`.\n`T2_cl / T1_cl = m1 / m2 = 2`, so `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl + 2 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n**Correct (Relativistic) Calculation**\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy `E` is also `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSubstituting this gives `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\nSince the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n`(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1. `T1 + T2 = 3`  => `T2 = 3 - T1`\n2. `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*99`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Difference**\nThe difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_cl = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\nConverting to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the initial state and parameters:**\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is 0.\n\n**2. Define the final state and parameters:**\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   `m1` is the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**3. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nConvert these masses to rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (`m2`): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\nThe energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n`Q = T_total = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\nIn classical mechanics, for a decay from rest, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2 = p`). The kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\nSubstituting `T2_classical`:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**6. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1:**\nWe must use the principles of conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The magnitudes of the momenta are equal, `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before equals the total energy after. The total energy of a particle is `E = T + m*c^2`.\n    `E_initial = E1 + E2`\n    `300 GeV = E1 + E2`\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nFrom this, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\nWe know `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`:\n`(E1 - E2)(300) = (198)^2 - (99)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_rel = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**7.

Define the initial conditions and conservation laws\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State (after fission):**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2` and kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n    *   From the problem statement, `m1` is the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission equals the total energy after.\n        `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n        `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments and the total kinetic energy\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\n*   We have `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   Substituting this into `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, we get `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   This gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   And `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (`Q-value`) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies:\n*   `T_total = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1=p2`), we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, using the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\nThis leads to the relation: `(p*c)^2 = T * (T + 2*m*c^2)`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n\nWe substitute the known values (all in GeV):\n*   `T2 = 3 - T1`\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99`\n\nThe equation becomes:\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classically calculated value is:\n*   `Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy (M*c²):** 300 GeV\n*   **Relationship between fragment masses:** Let the masses of the two fragments be m₁ and m₂.

Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (T₁ + T₂).\n\n*   **Q = M*c² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)**\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n*   Q = 3000 MeV\n\n### 3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\n*   **Conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂):**\n    *   The classical formula for kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n    *   Therefore, p = √(2mT).\n    *   √(2m₁T₁_classical) = √(2m₂T₂_classical)  =>  m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical.\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:**\n    *   Since m₁ = 2m₂, we have 2m₂ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical  =>  T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is Q = T₁_classical + T₂_classical.\n    *   3 GeV = T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 * T₁_classical.\n    *   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum and energy are related by the equation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where E is the total energy (E = T + mc²).\n\n*   **Relativistic momentum-energy relation:**\n    *   (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc².\n*   **Conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂ => (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²):**\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c².\n*   **Solving for T₁:**\n    *   We know T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substitute this into the equation.\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)\n    *   T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\n    *   396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁\n    *   396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    *   600T₁ = 603\n    *   **T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV.**\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n\n*   **Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)**\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1.

Calculate T₁ using the correct relativistic formulas:**\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment be 'p'.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². This can be rewritten as (pc)² = E² - (m c²)².\nSince E = T + mc², we have (pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc².\n\nFor the two fragments:\n*   (pc)² = T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²)\n*   (pc)² = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n\nEquating these two expressions:\nT₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n\nWe also know that T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁.

We are given two conditions:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: $m_1 = 2m_2$. We will call $m_1$ the \"more massive\" fragment.\n2.  The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\nFrom these two conditions, we can find the rest masses of the fragments. Substitute the first condition into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\nThen, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n\nNow we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 0.66(Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $m_2c^2 = 0.33(Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe total rest-mass energy of the fragments is $198 + 99 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energy is converted into the total kinetic energy (Q-value) of the fragments:\n*   $T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $T_{total} = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### 2. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn both classical and relativistic mechanics, since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   $|\\vec{p_1}| = |\\vec{p_2}| = p$.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   For the more massive fragment: $T_{1,class} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$\n*   For the less massive fragment: $T_{2,class} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n\nFrom this, we can establish a ratio of their kinetic energies:\n$\\frac{T_{1,class}}{T_{2,class}} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$\n\nSince $m_1 = 2m_2$, the ratio is:\n$\\frac{T_{1,class}}{T_{2,class}} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies T_{2,class} = 2T_{1,class}$.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy:\n$T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,class} + 2T_{1,class} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_{1,class} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,class} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment calculated classically is **1.000 GeV**.\n\n### 3. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest mass ($m$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. The total energy is also the sum of kinetic energy and rest-mass energy, $E = T + m_0c^2$.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$(T + m_0c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n$T^2 + 2Tm_0c^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tm_0c^2 = T(T + 2m_0c^2)$\n\nSince the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude ($p_1 = p_2$), their $(pc)^2$ values are also equal:\n$T_1(T_1 + 2m_1c^2) = T_2(T_2 + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nWe know:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $T_2 = T_{total} - T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} - T_1$\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation (let's omit the GeV units for clarity during calculation):\n$T_1(T_1 + 2 \\times 198) = (3 - T_1)((3 - T_1) + 2 \\times 99)$\n$T_1(T_1 + 396) = (3 - T_1)(3 - T_1 + 198)$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (3 - T_1)(201 - T_1)$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = 603 - 3T_1 - 201T_1 + T_1^2$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1 + T_1^2$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n$396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n$396T_1 + 204T_1 = 603$\n$600T_1 = 603$\n$T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} = \\frac{201}{200} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **1.005 GeV**.\n\n### 4. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for T1.\n$\\Delta T_1 = T_{1,rel} - T_{1,class}$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1.000 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nFinally, we convert this difference to MeV:\n$1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Q-value\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus and the two fragments.\n*   **Initial Nucleus (M):** The rest-mass energy is given as `M * c² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragments (m1 and m2):** Let `m1` be the more massive fragment. We are given two conditions:\n    1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we can solve for the masses of the fragments in terms of `M`:\n*   `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`  => `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   `m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1 * c² = 0.66 * (300 GeV) = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2 * c² = 0.33 * (300 GeV) = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe **Q-value** is the total kinetic energy released during the fission. This is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = (M * c²) - (m1 * c² + m2 * c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV = 3000 MeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the total kinetic energy `Q` is shared between the two fragments. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momentum.\n*   `p1 = p2` (in magnitude)\n\nThe classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`. Therefore, the ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = Q`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = Q`\n*   `T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3000 MeV / 3 = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nFor the correct relativistic calculation, we again use the conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy is conserved, and the magnitudes of the momenta are equal. The relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, which implies `(p1*c)² = (p2*c)²`.\n*   `E1² - (m1*c²)² = E2² - (m2*c²)²`\n*   `E1² - E2² = (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)²`\n*   `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c² - m2*c²)(m1*c² + m2*c²) `\n\nFrom the conservation of total energy, `E1 + E2 = M*c² = 300 GeV`. Plugging in the known values:\n*   `(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)`\n*   `E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n*   `2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n*   `E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy T1 is the total energy of the fragment minus its rest-mass energy (`T1 = E1 - m1*c²`).\n*   `T1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n*   `T1 = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1.\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Initial Values:** Set up the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (M*c^2) in GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Masses:** Use the given relationships (m1 = 2*m2 and m1+m2 = 0.99*M) to determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (m1*c^2 and m2*c^2).\n3.  **Calculate Q-value:** The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical):** Based on the conservation of momentum (p1 = p2) in classical mechanics (K = p^2 / 2m), the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass (K1/K2 = m2/m1). Use this ratio to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1_classical) from the total kinetic energy (Q).\n5.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1):** Based on the conservation of momentum in relativistic mechanics (E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2), we can establish a relationship between the kinetic energies and rest-mass energies of the fragments. Solve for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1).\n6.  **Calculate the Difference:** Find the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy (T1) and the classical kinetic energy (T1_classical).\n7.  **Select the Answer:** Convert the difference to MeV and compare it with the given options to find the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define initial values\n# E0_M is the rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus in GeV.\nE0_M = 300.0  # GeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate fragment rest-mass energies\n# The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n# m1c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * M*c^2\nm1c2_plus_m2c2 = 0.99 * E0_M\n\n# One fragment (m1) is 2 times more massive than the other (m2).\n# m1 = 2 * m2  => m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2\n# We have a system of two equations:\n# 1) m1c2 + m2c2 = m1c2_plus_m2c2\n# 2) m1c2 = 2 * m2c2\n# Substitute (2) into (1):\n# 2 * m2c2 + m2c2 = m1c2_plus_m2c2\n# 3 * m2c2 = m1c2_plus_m2c2\nm2c2 = m1c2_plus_m2c2 / 3.0\nm1c2 = 2.0 * m2c2\n\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1*c^2): {m1c2:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2*c^2): {m2c2:.2f} GeV\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Q-value (total kinetic energy released)\n# Q = Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy\nQ = E0_M - m1c2_plus_m2c2\nprint(f\"Total kinetic energy released (Q-value): {Q:.2f} GeV\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1_classical)\n# In classical mechanics, from conservation of momentum (p1=p2), K = p^2/(2m).\n# This means K1/K2 = m2/m1.\n# Since K1 + K2 = Q, we have K1 + (m1/m2)*K1 = Q => K1 * (1 + m1/m2) = Q\n# T1_classical = Q / (1 + m1/m2) = Q / (1 + (2*m2)/m2) = Q / 3\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\nprint(f\"Classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1_classical): {T1_classical:.4f} GeV\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1)\n# From conservation of momentum |p1|=|p2|, and E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, we get:\n# (pc)^2 = (K1 + m1c^2)^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = (K2 + m2c^2)^2 - (m2c^2)^2\n# K1^2 + 2*K1*m1c^2 = K2^2 + 2*K2*m2c^2\n# Substitute K2 = Q - K1 and solve for K1 (which is T1).\n# The solution is T1 = Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2) / (2 * (m1c^2 + m2c^2 + Q))\nT1 = Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2) / (2 * (m1c2_plus_m2c2 + Q))\nprint(f\"Relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1): {T1:.4f} GeV\")\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the difference\ndifference_GeV = T1 - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000 # Convert GeV to MeV\n\nprint(f\"\\nDifference (T1 - T1_classical): {difference_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference in MeV: {difference_MeV:.2f} MeV\")\n\n# Step 7: Select the answer\noptions = {'A': 10, 'B': 5, 'C': 20, 'D': 2}\nfinal_choice = ''\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    if math.isclose(difference_MeV, value, rel_tol=1e-2):\n        final_choice = choice\n        break\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated difference is approximately {round(difference_MeV)} MeV, which corresponds to option {final_choice}.\")\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(f'<<<{final_choice}>>>')\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1*c^2): 198.00 GeV\nRest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2*c^2): 99.00 GeV\nTotal kinetic energy released (Q-value): 3.00 GeV\nClassical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1_classical): 1.0000 GeV\nRelativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1): 1.0050 GeV\n\nDifference (T1 - T1_classical): 0.0050 GeV\nDifference in MeV: 5.00 MeV\n\nThe calculated difference is approximately 5 MeV, which corresponds to option B.\n<<<B>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Given Information**\n*   Initial nucleus: Mass M, at rest.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: E_M = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Process: Spontaneous fission into two fragments.\n*   Fragment rest-masses: m1 and m2. We are told one is twice as massive as the other. Let's define m1 as the more massive fragment, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   Mass relationship: The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial rest-mass. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses (or Rest-Mass Energies) of the Fragments**\nIt's easier to work with rest-mass energies (like m*c²) throughout the problem.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²)\n    2.  (m1 + m2)*c² = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    2*(m2*c²) + (m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n    3*(m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n    m2*c² = 99 GeV.\n*   Now, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1):\n    m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe total energy is conserved. The energy released as kinetic energy (Q) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n*   Initial Total Energy (nucleus at rest) = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Final Total Rest-Mass Energy = m1*c² + m2*c² = 198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   Total Kinetic Energy (Q) = Initial Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy\n    Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n    This 3 GeV of energy is shared as kinetic energy between the two fragments.\n\n**4. Relativistic Calculation of T1 (The Correct Value)**\nWe must use conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest (momentum = 0). Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero. The two fragments must fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n    |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest-mass (m) by: E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\n*   We can write this for both fragments:\n    *   E1² = (p*c)² + (m1*c²)²\n    *   E2² = (p*c)² + (m2*c²)²\n    Since `(p*c)²` is the same for both, we have:\n    E1² - (m1*c²)² = E2² - (m2*c²)²\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total final energy (E1 + E2) must equal the total initial energy (M*c²).\n    E1 + E2 = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Now we solve the system of equations. Rearrange the momentum equation:\n    E1² - E2² = (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n    (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n*   Substitute the known values: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, m1*c² = 198 GeV, m2*c² = 99 GeV.\n    (E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n    (E1 - E2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403\n    E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV.\n*   We now have a simple linear system:\n    1.  E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    2.  E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV\n*   Add the two equations to solve for E1:\n    2*E1 = 398.01 GeV\n    E1 = 199.005 GeV.\n*   The kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest-mass energy m1*c²:\n    T1 (correct) = E1 - m1*c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**5. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\nIn the classical approximation, we distribute the same total kinetic energy (Q = 3 GeV) using classical formulas.\n*   **Kinetic Energy Formula:** T = p² / (2m).\n*   From conservation of momentum, the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments.\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    T1 / T2 = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2.\n    So, T1 (classical) / T2 (classical) = 1/2, which means T2 (classical) = 2 * T1 (classical).\n*   The total kinetic energy is still Q = 3 GeV:\n    T1 (classical) + T2 (classical) = 3 GeV\n    T1 (classical) + 2 * T1 (classical) = 3 GeV\n    3 * T1 (classical) = 3 GeV\n    T1 (classical) = 1 GeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = T1 (correct) - T1 (classical)\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\n**7. Convert to Final Units (MeV)**\nThe answer options are in MeV.\n*   1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the two calculated values is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.\nInitial rest-mass energy, $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\nLet $m_1$ be the more massive fragment. We are given $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n\nThe sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n$m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\nSubstituting $m_1 = 2m_2$:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\nThen, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 0.66 M$.\n\nWe can now find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n-   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n-   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n$Q = E_0 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nThis is the total kinetic energy shared by the fragments: $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**1. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n$p_1 = p_2 = p$.\nThe classical relation between kinetic energy (T) and momentum (p) is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\nTherefore, $p^2 = 2m_1 T_{1,cl} = 2m_2 T_{2,cl}$.\nThis implies that the kinetic energy is shared in inverse proportion to the mass:\n$T_{1,cl} / T_{2,cl} = m_2 / m_1 = 1/2$.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n2.  $T_{2,cl} = 2 T_{1,cl}$\n\nSubstituting (2) into (1):\n$T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the classical kinetic energy is $T_{1,cl} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**2. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nConservation of momentum ($p_1 = p_2 = p$) still holds. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\nWe can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2$.\nSince the total energy is $E = T + m_0c^2$, we can expand this to $(pc)^2 = (T + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n\nEquating the momenta for both fragments:\n$(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nSubstitute $T_2 = Q - T_1 = 3 - T_1$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n$T_1^2 + 396 T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198 T_1)$\n\nCancel $T_1^2$ from both sides:\n$396 T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198 T_1$\n$396 T_1 = 603 - 204 T_1$\n$396 T_1 + 204 T_1 = 603$\n$600 T_1 = 603$\n$T_1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. The Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n$\\Delta T_1 = T_1(\\text{relativistic}) - T_1(\\text{classical})$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Initial momentum: \\(P_{initial} = 0\\).\n    *   Rest-mass energy: \\(E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\).\n    *   The fragments move with momenta \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) and kinetic energies \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\).\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nThe problem states:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: \\(m_1 = 2m_2\\).\n2.  The sum of the rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: \\(m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M\\).\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n\\(2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M\\)\nThen, \\(m_1 = 2 \\times (0.33 M) = 0.66 M\\).\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (fragment 1):\n    \\(m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (fragment 2):\n    \\(m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\nThe total rest-mass energy of the fragments is \\(198 + 99 = 297 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy is conserved. The initial energy (300 GeV) is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energies. The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is:\n    \\(Q = T_1 + T_2 = (\\text{Initial mass energy}) - (\\text{Final mass energy})\\)\n    \\(Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. The two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum:\n    \\(p_1 = p_2 = p\\).\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy \\(T_1\\)\n\nThe relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is \\(E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2\\). A particle's total energy is also the sum of its rest-mass energy and kinetic energy, \\(E = T + mc^2\\).\n\nFrom the momentum conservation, we can write:\n\\(p_1^2 = p_2^2\\)\n\\(\\frac{E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2}{c^2} = \\frac{E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2}{c^2}\\)\n\\(E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2\\)\n\nWe also know from energy conservation that the total final energy is the initial energy: \\(E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}\\). Thus, \\(E_2 = 300 - E_1\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(E_2\\) into the momentum equation:\n\\(E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (300 - E_1)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2\\)\n\nNow, plug in the values for the rest-mass energies (\\(m_1c^2 = 198\\) GeV, \\(m_2c^2 = 99\\) GeV):\n\\(E_1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E_1)^2 - (99)^2\\)\n\\(E_1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600E_1 + E_1^2) - 9801\\)\n\nThe \\(E_1^2\\) terms cancel out:\n\\(-39204 = 90000 - 600E_1 - 9801\\)\n\\(-39204 = 80199 - 600E_1\\)\n\\(600E_1 = 80199 + 39204\\)\n\\(600E_1 = 119403\\)\n\\(E_1 = \\frac{119403}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\nThe kinetic energy \\(T_1\\) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n\\(T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\\(T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV}\\).\n\n### 5. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy \\(T_{1, classical}\\)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is \\(T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\). Since the momenta are equal (\\(p_1 = p_2\\)), the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n\\(\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{99 \\text{ GeV}/c^2}{198 \\text{ GeV}/c^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\nSo, \\(T_{2,cl} = 2 T_{1,cl}\\).\n\nThe total kinetic energy is \\(T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\\(T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\\(3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\\(T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}\\).\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n\\(\\Delta T_1 = T_1 - T_{1,cl} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}\\).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m₁`, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n    *   The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (`m₁c²`): `0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (`m₂c²`): `0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energies (`T₁` and `T₂`).\n\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + m₂c²) + (T₁ + T₂)`\n\nThe total kinetic energy released (`Q`) is:\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest, so by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is related to momentum `p` by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n\n*   `T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nTaking the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / (2m₁)) / (p² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁`\n\nSince `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio `m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 1/2`  => `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T₁\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²`. Since total energy `E = T + mc²`, we can write:\n\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2T(mc²) + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂ = p`), we have:\n`(pc)² = T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n\nWe know:\n*   `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n*   `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n*   `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n\nCancel the `T₁²` term from both sides:\n`396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is M*c² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   The more massive fragment is m₁: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe can determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (m₁c² and m₂c²) using the given relations.\n\n1.  Substitute m₁ = 2 * m₂ into the sum equation:\n    (2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n    3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\n    m₂ = 0.33 * M\n\n2.  Now, find m₁:\n    m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\n3.  Calculate their rest-mass energies:\n    *   **m₁c²** = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n    *   **m₂c²** = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies, due to the conservation of energy.\n\n*   Q = T₁ + T₂ = M*c² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/ (2m), where p is the momentum.\n\n*   From the conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: |p₁| = |p₂| = p_classical.\n*   Therefore, T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p_classical² / 2m₁) / (p_classical² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2.\n*   This gives us T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   Substituting T₂_classical: T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV.\n*   3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV**.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct Relativistic T₁\n\nFor the correct value, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)², where the total energy E = T + m*c².\n\n*   This can be rearranged to find the momentum: (pc)² = E² - (m*c²)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²).\n*   From the conservation of momentum, |p₁| = |p₂|, so (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n*   T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (m₁c²) = T₂² + 2 * T₂ * (m₂c²).\n*   We know T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁, m₁c² = 198 GeV, and m₂c² = 99 GeV.\n*   T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99).\n*   T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁).\n*   T₁² + 396*T₁ = T₁² + 603 - 204*T₁.\n*   Cancel T₁² from both sides: 396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁.\n*   (396 + 204) * T₁ = 603.\n*   600 * T₁ = 603.\n*   **T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV**.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n\n*   Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its total energy is its rest-mass energy, and its momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`. These fragments are in motion.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragments' masses:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`. (We'll call `m1` the more massive fragment).\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations:\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Now find `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies using the initial energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (`m2`): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy comes from the mass that was \"lost\" in the fission process (converted from mass energy to kinetic energy).\n*   Initial Energy = `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   Final Rest Energy = `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV`\n*   Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value) = `Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Relativistic Calculation of T1 (Correct Value)**\n\nWe must use two conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total kinetic energy is shared between the fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus was at rest (momentum = 0), so the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. We can rearrange this to solve for momentum: `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince `E = T + m*c^2` (Total Energy = Kinetic Energy + Rest-mass Energy), we can write:\n`(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\n\nNow, apply `|p1| = |p2|`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have a system of two equations for T1 and T2:\n1.  `T2 = 3 - T1`\n2.  `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**5. Classical Calculation of T1 (Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2 = p_classical`.\n*   So, `T1 = p_classical^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p_classical^2 / (2*m2)`.\n*   Let's find the ratio of the kinetic energies: `T1/T2 = (p_classical^2 / 2*m1) / (p_classical^2 / 2*m2) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio `m2/m1 = 1/2`. So, `T1/T2 = 1/2` or `T2 = 2*T1`.\n*   Now use the conservation of energy: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T2 = 2*T1`: `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`\n*   `3*T1 = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nFinally, find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.0 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.

Determine the initial and final rest-mass energies and the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Let the rest masses of the two fragments be `m1` and `m2`, with `m1` being the more massive fragment.\n*   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`. Therefore, their rest-mass energies are related by `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M:\n    `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    Multiplying by c^2, we get the sum of their rest-mass energies:\n    `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we can solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2` into the sum equation:\n        `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   Now find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n        `m1*c^2 = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV`.\n*   The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy:\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\n\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the fragments must also be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   So, `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   The total kinetic energy is `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T2_classical`:\n    `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the correct (relativistic) value of T1.**\n\n*   In special relativity, the relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c^2) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy is also `E = T + m*c^2` (kinetic energy + rest-mass energy).\n*   Substituting this into the relation: `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding and simplifying gives an expression for momentum: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   Since momentum is conserved (`p1 = p2`), we can equate their `(p*c)^2` values:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n*   We know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. We can now solve for the relativistic T1:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4.

Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, `E_i = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Total rest-mass energy of fragments = `0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Let the fragments have rest-mass energies `E_1` and `E_2`. We are given `E_1 = 2 * E_2`.\n*   `E_1 + E_2 = 297 GeV`\n*   `2 * E_2 + E_2 = 297 GeV` => `3 * E_2 = 297 GeV` => `E_2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, `E_1 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`. `E_1` is the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between initial and final rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Classical Approximation**\n*   By conservation of momentum (`p=mv`), the fragment with less mass has more velocity. The kinetic energies (`T = p^2/2m`) are inversely proportional to the masses.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV` => `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n*   We use conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Total Energy Conservation:** `E_total_initial = E_total_final`. The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the fragments (`E_frag = T + mc^2`).\n    `300 GeV = E_total1 + E_total2`.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The fragments have equal and opposite momenta. From the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E_total^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, we can write:\n    `(pc)^2 = E_total1^2 - (E_1)^2 = E_total2^2 - (E_2)^2`\n*   Substitute `E_total2 = 300 - E_total1` and the rest-mass energies `E_1=198`, `E_2=99`:\n    `E_total1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E_total1)^2 - (99)^2`\n    `E_total1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E_total1 + E_total1^2) - 9801`\n    `-39204 = 80199 - 600*E_total1`\n    `600*E_total1 = 119403`\n    `E_total1 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The correct kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n    `T1_correct = E_total1 - E_1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n*   Difference = `T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1.

Relativistic Calculation (Correct T₁)\n\nIn spontaneous fission, the initial momentum is zero. Due to the conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. For relativistic particles, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². The kinetic energy (T) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy (T = E - mc²).\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation, we can write:\n(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²\n\nSince the momenta are equal (|p₁| = |p₂|), we have (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²:\nT₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²\n\nWe also know that T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁. Substituting this into the equation:\nT₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + T₁² + 594 - 198T₁\n\nSimplifying the equation by canceling T₁² from both sides:\n396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n600T₁ = 603\nT₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = **1.005 GeV**\n\nConverting to MeV:\nT₁ = 1.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = **1005 MeV**\n\n### 4.

The total rest-mass energy of the fragments is:\n    (m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n\n2.  We have a system of two equations:\n    *   m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n    *   m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)\n\n3.  Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n    3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV\n    **m₂c² = 99 GeV**\n\n4.  Now find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    **m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\n### 3.

Substitute $m_1 = 2m_2$ into the second equation:\n    $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\n2.  Now find $m_1$:\n    $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33 M) = 0.66 M$.\n\nNext, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 M c^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 M c^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy ($Q$) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy.\n*   $Q = E_{initial} - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $Q = Mc^2 - (0.66M + 0.33M)c^2 = Mc^2 - 0.99Mc^2 = 0.01Mc^2$.\n*   Using the given value $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    $Q = 0.01 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: $Q = T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$, where $p=mv$ is the momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum, $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n*   **Kinetic Energies:** $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$.\n*   Since $m_1 = 2m_2$, the ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which means $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n*   **Solve for T1:** Substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    $T_1 + T_2 = Q \\implies T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    So, the classical kinetic energy is $T_{1,class} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the conservation of four-momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total final energy equals the initial rest energy: $E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. (Here, $E = T + mc^2$ is the total energy).\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. We can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$.\n*   Since $p_1=p_2$, we must have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n    $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n*   Rearranging gives: $E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n*   Factor both sides: $(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (m_1c^2 - m_2c^2)(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$.\n*   Now, we plug in the known values:\n    *   $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = (198 \\text{ GeV} - 99 \\text{ GeV})(198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n    *   $(E_1 - E_2)(300) = (99)(297)$\n    *   $E_1 - E_2 = \\frac{99 \\times 297}{300} = \\frac{29403}{300} = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n    1.  $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n    2.  $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Adding the two equations gives: $2E_1 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV} \\implies E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   **Solve for T1:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy, $T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2$.\n    $T_{1,rel} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value ($T_{1,rel}$) and the classical approximation ($T_{1,class}$).\n*   Difference = $T_{1,rel} - T_{1,class}$\n*   Difference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\n*   Difference = $0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the initial state and parameters\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, E_M = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   It splits into two fragments with rest-masses m1 and m2.\n*   The more massive fragment is m1, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\nWe can write the mass relationship in terms of rest-mass energy:\n*   m1*c² + m2*c² = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   We also know m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²).\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n*   2*(m2*c²) + m2*c² = 297 GeV\n*   3*(m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n*   **m2*c² = 99 GeV**\n\nNow find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n*   **m1*c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This is due to the conservation of energy.\n*   Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)\n*   Q = M*c² - (m1*c² + m2*c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n*   Since the options are in MeV, let's convert Q: **Q = 3000 MeV**.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/ (2m), where p is the momentum.\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: |p1| = |p2|.\n*   Therefore, p1² = p2².\n*   2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical\n*   m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\n*   T2_classical = (m1 / m2) * T1_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n*   T1_classical + T2_classical = Q\n*   T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3000 MeV\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3000 MeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1000 MeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct T1 using Relativistic Dynamics\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)². The kinetic energy T is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy: T = E - m*c².\n*   This gives the relativistic momentum-energy relation: (p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²).\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, |p1| = |p2|, which means (p1*c)² = (p2*c)².\n*   T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)\n*   We know T2 = Q - T1 = 3000 MeV - T1. Let's substitute this and the mass-energy values (m1c²=198000 MeV, m2c²=99000 MeV).\n\nT1² + 2 * T1 * (198000) = (3000 - T1)² + 2 * (3000 - T1) * (99000)\nT1² + 396000 * T1 = (9,000,000 - 6000*T1 + T1²) + (594,000,000 - 198,000*T1)\n\nThe T1² terms on both sides cancel out:\n396,000 * T1 = 9,000,000 - 6,000*T1 + 594,000,000 - 198,000*T1\n396,000 * T1 = 603,000,000 - 204,000*T1\n\nNow, group the T1 terms:\n(396,000 + 204,000) * T1 = 603,000,000\n600,000 * T1 = 603,000,000\nT1 = 603,000,000 / 600,000\n**T1 (correct) = 1005 MeV**\n\n### 6. Find the difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the T1 value from the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = T1 (correct) - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nOf course. Here is my plan to solve the problem and the corresponding Python code.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Define Constants:** I'll start by defining the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (`M*c^2`), the mass ratio of the fragments (`m1/m2`), and the fraction of the initial mass that constitutes the final rest masses.\n\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Energies:** Using the given ratios and the total initial energy, I will set up and solve a system of equations to find the rest-mass energies of the more massive fragment (`E_m1`) and the less massive fragment (`E_m2`).\n\n3.  **Determine Total Kinetic Energy:** The total kinetic energy (`T_total`) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This is also known as the Q-value of the reaction.\n\n4.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (`T1_classical`):** I will use the principles of conservation of momentum in a classical framework. In this framework, the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass (`T = p^2 / 2m`). Since the fragments have equal and opposite momenta, I can find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T1_classical`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (`T1`):** I will again use the conservation of momentum. However, this time I'll use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`. By equating the squared momentum of both fragments and substituting the known values, I will solve for the correct relativistic kinetic energy, `T1`.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference:** Finally, I'll calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 (`T1 - T1_classical`) and convert the result from GeV to MeV to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_fission_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a physics problem about nuclear fission, calculating the difference\n    between relativistic and classical kinetic energy for one of the fragments.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define initial values from the problem description\n    # All energy values are in GeV for calculation convenience.\n    E_M = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy of nucleus M in GeV\n    mass_ratio_m1_m2 = 2.0  # m1 = 2 * m2\n    final_mass_fraction = 0.99  # m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\n    print(\"--- Problem Setup ---\")\n    print(f\"Initial rest-mass energy (M*c^2): {E_M} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Mass ratio (m1/m2): {mass_ratio_m1_m2}\")\n    print(f\"Final rest-mass fraction ((m1+m2)/M): {final_mass_fraction}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments (E_m1 and E_m2)\n    # E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M\n    # E_m1 = 2 * E_m2\n    # So, 2*E_m2 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M => 3*E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M\n    E_m_sum = final_mass_fraction * E_M\n    E_m2 = E_m_sum / (mass_ratio_m1_m2 + 1)\n    E_m1 = mass_ratio_m1_m2 * E_m2\n    \n    print(\"--- Fragment Properties ---\")\n    print(f\"Sum of fragment rest-mass energies (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2): {E_m_sum:.2f} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1*c^2): {E_m1:.2f} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2*c^2): {E_m2:.2f} GeV\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n    T_total = E_M - E_m_sum\n    print(\"--- Energy Release ---\")\n    print(f\"Total kinetic energy released (T1 + T2): {T_total:.2f} GeV\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n    # In classical mechanics, p = mv, T = 0.5*m*v^2 = p^2/(2m)\n    # Conservation of momentum means p1 = p2 (in magnitude)\n    # T1/T2 = (p^2/(2*m1)) / (p^2/(2*m2)) = m2/m1 = 1/mass_ratio_m1_m2\n    # T1 + T2 = T_total => T1 + T1*(m1/m2) = T_total\n    T1_classical = T_total / (1 + mass_ratio_m1_m2)\n\n    print(\"--- Classical Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Kinetic energy of massive fragment (T1_classical): {T1_classical:.4f} GeV\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate T1 using relativistic mechanics\n    # Relativistic momentum-energy relation: (pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2\n    # Total energy E = T + mc^2, so (pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*mc^2\n    # Conservation of momentum means (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2\n    # T1^2 + 2*T1*E_m1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E_m2\n    # Let T1 be the variable x.

This means its initial total momentum is zero (P_initial = 0) and its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy (E_initial = M*c^2).\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** M*c^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   **Fission Process:** The nucleus spontaneously splits into two fragments, which we'll call fragment 1 and fragment 2, with rest masses m1 and m2 respectively.\n*   **Mass Relation:** \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. It could mean m1 = m2 + 2*m2 = 3*m2, or it could be intended to mean m1 = 2*m2. Given that this is a physics problem with multiple-choice answers, one interpretation will likely lead to a correct option. We will test the interpretation m1 = 2*m2, assuming m1 is the more massive fragment.\n*   **Sum of Final Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** In this decay process, both total energy and momentum are conserved.\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) calculated using relativistic mechanics and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) mechanics. Let's call these T1_relativistic and T1_classical. The final answer is |T1_relativistic - T1_classical|.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Rest Masses and Total Kinetic Energy\n\nLet's use the given mass relations to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n\n1.  We have the system of equations:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2\n    *   m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    *   (2*m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n    *   3*m2 = 0.99 * M\n    *   m2 = 0.33 * M\n\n3.  Now find m1:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\n4.  Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments using M*c^2 = 300 GeV:\n    *   m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV\n    *   m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV\n\n5.  The total kinetic energy (T_total), also known as the Q-value, is the energy released from the conversion of rest mass.\n    *   T_total = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Sum of Final Rest-Mass Energies)\n    *   T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n    *   T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n    *   T_total = 3000 MeV\n\n### Step 3: Calculating T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The two fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be p.\n    *   p1 = p2 = p\n\n2.  **Relating Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical\n    *   p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical\n    *   Therefore, m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\n    *   T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2\n\n3.  **Distributing the Total Kinetic Energy:**\n    *   We know T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is T_total = T1_classical + T2_classical.\n    *   3000 MeV = T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 * T1_classical\n    *   T1_classical = 3000 MeV / 3 = 1000 MeV\n\n### Step 4: Calculating T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is E = T + m*c^2, and it's related to momentum by E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   Energy: E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV\n    *   Momentum: |p1| = |p2| = p\n\n2.  **Deriving T1_relativistic:** A standard formula for the energy of a decay product (fragment 1) in a 2-body decay from rest is:\n    *   E1 = [ (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ] / (2 * M*c^2)\n\n3.  **Plugging in the values:**\n    *   E1 = [ (300)^2 + (198)^2 - (99)^2 ] / (2 * 300)\n    *   E1 = [ 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ] / 600\n    *   E1 = [ 129204 - 9801 ] / 600\n    *   E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV\n\n4.  The relativistic kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n    *   T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2\n    *   T1_relativistic = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n    *   T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Final Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the two calculated values for T1.\n\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV\n*   Difference = 5 MeV\n\nThis matches option B.

Define the initial parameters:\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n\n### 2. Determine the properties of the fragments:\n*   Let the rest-masses of the two fragments be `m1` and `m2`. We are given that one is twice as massive as the other, so let `m1 = 2 * m2`. `m1` is the more massive fragment.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   We can express this in terms of rest-mass energy: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   Substituting the given values: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, it follows that `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n    *   `2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n### 3.

Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n*   By conservation of momentum, the initial momentum (zero) must equal the final total momentum. This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `p1 = p2`.\n*   Therefore, `m1 * v1 = m2 * v2`.\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    *   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p1^2 / (2*m1)) / (p2^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n    *   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   `T1_classical = (1/2) * T2_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`:\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1:\n*   The relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest-mass energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this gives `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding this, we get `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore: `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Let's substitute this into the equation:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n*   Now, we simplify by canceling the `T1^2` terms:\n    *   `396 * T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    *   `(396 + 204) * T1 = 603`\n    *   `600 * T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n    *   `T1 = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 6.

Calculate T1 Using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum.\n*   From the conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta, so `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   The ratio of their classical kinetic energies is:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\n    `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`:\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 4.

Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** We have a nucleus of mass `M` at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial total energy is `E_initial = M*c^2` and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. These fragments will be moving to conserve momentum, so they will have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, respectively.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Masses of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\n*   The problem states a relationship between the masses: one fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll designate `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also means their rest-mass energies are related: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. In terms of energy: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   We can now calculate the rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2` into the sum: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` => `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy in the fission is called the Q-value. It's the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n    *   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T1` using the Classical Approximation**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n*   By conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = p2`.\n*   From the kinetic energy formula, we have `p = sqrt(2mT)`.\n*   Therefore, `sqrt(2*m1*T1_classical) = sqrt(2*m2*T2_classical)`, which simplifies to `m1*T1_classical = m2*T2_classical`.\n*   Using `m1 = 2*m2`, we get `2*m2*T1_classical = m2*T2_classical`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`. The less massive particle gets more kinetic energy.\n*   The total kinetic energy is `Q`: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy `T1`**\n\n*   In relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   Again, conservation of momentum means `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore: `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`. Let's substitute this and the mass-energy values (`m1*c^2 = 198` GeV, `m2*c^2 = 99` GeV) into the equation. For simplicity, we'll work in units of GeV.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    *   `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Now, we solve for `T1`:\n    *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   The correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero and its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\nThe nucleus undergoes fission, splitting into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\nWe are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate `m1` as the more massive fragment:\n`m1 = 2 * m2`\n\nThe sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n`m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nWe can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of M:\nSubstitute `m1 = 2*m2` into the second equation:\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow solve for `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest energy of `m1`: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * M*c^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of `m2`: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * M*c^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is calculated by the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy of `3 GeV` is shared between the two fragments `T1` and `T2`.\n\n**Case 1: Relativistic Calculation (Correct Value of T1)**\n\nWe use two conservation laws:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: The initial nucleus was at rest (momentum = 0), so the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momenta be `p`. `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nFrom this, we can write `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since total energy `E = T + m*c^2` (kinetic + rest energy), this becomes `(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we can set their squared momenta equal:\n`(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out. Let's solve for T1:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Case 2: Classical Approximation of T1**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2 = p`.\nSo, `p^2 = 2*m1*T1_classical` and `p^2 = 2*m2*T2_classical`.\nTherefore:\n`2*m1*T1_classical = 2*m2*T2_classical`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33 M) / (0.66 M) = 1/2`\nThis means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nFirst, we need to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. We are given two pieces of information:\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let their rest-mass energies be `m1c^2` and `m2c^2`. We can write this relationship as: `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`.\n*   The sum of their rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy (`Mc^2 = 300 GeV`): `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow we solve this system of two equations:\n1.  Substitute the first equation into the second: `(2 * m2c^2) + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n2.  Simplify to find the energy of the lighter fragment: `3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV`, which gives `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n3.  Use this to find the energy of the more massive fragment: `m1c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the difference between the initial rest energy and the sum of the final rest energies.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal magnitudes of momentum and travel in opposite directions (`p1 = p2`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Energies:** We can find the ratio of the classical kinetic energies:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p1^2 / 2m1) / (p2^2 / 2m2)`. Since `p1 = p2`, this simplifies to `m2 / m1`.\n    The mass ratio `m2/m1` is the same as the rest-energy ratio `m2c^2 / m1c^2`, which is `99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n    So, `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   **Solve for T1_classical:**\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (`p1 = p2`)** and the **relativistic energy-momentum relation** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2` gives us `E1^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2c^2)^2`.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy** states that the initial energy equals the sum of the final total energies (rest + kinetic): `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`. We can write `E2 = 300 - E1`.\n*   Now, substitute the known values into the momentum equation:\n    `E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2`\n    `E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801`\n*   The `E1^2` terms cancel. Rearrange the equation to solve for `E1`:\n    `600 * E1 = 90000 - 9801 + 39204`\n    `600 * E1 = 119403`\n    `E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n*   The correct kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1c^2`:\n    `T1_correct = E1 - m1c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classically approximated value is:\n*   Difference = `T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\nThe question's options are in MeV, so we convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Define Given Quantities**\n\n*   Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus, `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest, so its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n*   The fission products are two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Relation between fragment masses: `m1 = 2 * m2`. Fragment 1 is the more massive one.\n*   Sum of fragment rest masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nWe need to find the rest-mass energies `m1c²` and `m2c²`. We have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1c² = 2 * m2c²`\n2.  `m1c² + m2c² = 0.99 * Mc²`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2c² + m2c² = 0.99 * Mc²`\n`3 * m2c² = 0.99 * (300 GeV)`\n`3 * m2c² = 297 GeV`\n`m2c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find `m1c²` using equation (1):\n`m1c² = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies are:\n*   More massive fragment (m1): `m1c² = 198 GeV`\n*   Less massive fragment (m2): `m2c² = 99 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²) `\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate Kinetic Energy `T1` using Classical Approximation**\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (`p`).\n`p1 = p2 = p`\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`. The total kinetic energy `Q` is shared between the two fragments:\n`Q = T1_classical + T2_classical = p² / (2*m1) + p² / (2*m2)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is inversely proportional to their masses:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\nThis implies `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nSubstitute this into the equation for Q:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = Q`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate Kinetic Energy `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nWe again use the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`. The relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\nA particle's total energy is `E = T + mc²`, where `T` is its kinetic energy.\nFrom the energy-momentum relation, we can write the momentum as: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`:\n`T1² + 2 * T1 * (m1c²) = T2² + 2 * T2 * (m2c²) `\n\nWe also know that `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T1² + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)² + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n\nNow, solve for `T1`:\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1 = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value `T1` and the classical approximation `T1_classical` is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe python code confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial mass = M\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy = M*c² = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe can express the rest-mass energies of the fragments (m₁c² and m₂c²) in terms of the initial rest-mass energy (Mc²).\n\n*   From the given relations:\n    *   m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n    *   Since m₁ = 2 * m₂, it follows that m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²).\n\n*   Now, substitute the second equation into the first:\n    *   2*(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n    *   3*(m₂c²) = 297 GeV\n    *   m₂c² = 99 GeV\n\n*   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is:\n    *   m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (T₁ + T₂) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This is known as the Q-value of the reaction.\n\n*   Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Mc²) - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by T = p²/2m. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be 'p'.\n\n*   T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)\n*   T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)\n\nNow we can find the ratio of their kinetic energies:\n*   T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁ = m₂/(2m₂) = 1/2.\n*   This means T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy calculated in step 3:\n*   T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\n*   T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we must use the principles of conservation of four-momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy is E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV. The final total energy is E_final = E₁ + E₂, where E₁ = T₁ + m₁c² and E₂ = T₂ + m₂c² are the total relativistic energies of the fragments.\n    *   E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The magnitude of the momentum of the two fragments is equal, p₁ = p₂ = p. The relativistic relationship between total energy, momentum, and rest-mass energy is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   This gives (pc)² = E² - (mc²)².\n    *   Since the momenta are equal: E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²\n    *   E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²\n    *   (E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n    *   (E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) GeV²\n    *   (E₁ - E₂)(300) = (99)(297)\n    *   E₁ - E₂ = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV\n\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for E₁ and E₂:\n    1.  E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n    2.  E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV\n\n*   Adding the two equations gives:\n    *   2E₁ = 398.01 GeV\n    *   E₁ = 199.005 GeV\n\n*   The kinetic energy T₁ is the total energy E₁ minus the rest-mass energy m₁c²:\n    *   T₁ = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n\n### 6.

Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass is M.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `M*c² = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2*m₂`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T₁` and `T₂`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe can solve for the individual masses:\nSubstitute `m₁ = 2*m₂` into the sum equation:\n`2*m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n`m₂ = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`):\n    `m₁*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`):\n    `m₂*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy before fission must equal the total energy after fission.\n*   Energy before = `M*c² = 300 GeV` (since the nucleus is at rest).\n*   Energy after = `(m₁*c² + T₁) + (m₂*c² + T₂)`.\n\nSo, `M*c² = m₁*c² + m₂*c² + T₁ + T₂`.\nThe total kinetic energy `T_total = T₁ + T₂` released in the fission (also known as the Q-value) is:\n`T_total = M*c² - (m₁*c² + m₂*c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nTherefore, `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\nLet `p₁` and `p₂` be the magnitudes of the momenta of the fragments.\n`p₁ = p₂`\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p² / (2m)`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`), we have `p₁² = p₂²`.\n`2*m₁*T₁_cla = 2*m₂*T₂_cla`\n`m₁*T₁_cla = m₂*T₂_cla`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_cla / T₂_cla = m₂ / m₁ = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`.\nThis means `T₂_cla = 2 * T₁_cla`.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T₁_cla + T₂_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cla + 2*T₁_cla = 3 GeV`\n`3*T₁_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cla = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 6. Calculate T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\nThe total energy is also `E = T + m*c²`, where T is the kinetic energy.\nSubstituting this gives: `(T + m*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\nExpanding and rearranging for `(p*c)²`:\n`T² + 2*T*m*c² + (m*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n`(p*c)² = T² + 2*T*m*c² = T * (T + 2*m*c²)`.\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p₁ = p₂`, so `(p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)²`.\n`T₁_rel * (T₁_rel + 2*m₁*c²) = T₂_rel * (T₂_rel + 2*m₂*c²)`.\n\nWe have `T₂_rel = 3 - T₁_rel` (in GeV). Substitute this and the rest-mass energies:\n`T₁_rel * (T₁_rel + 2*198) = (3 - T₁_rel) * ((3 - T₁_rel) + 2*99)`\n`T₁_rel * (T₁_rel + 396) = (3 - T₁_rel) * (3 - T₁_rel + 198)`\n`T₁_rel² + 396*T₁_rel = (3 - T₁_rel) * (201 - T₁_rel)`\n`T₁_rel² + 396*T₁_rel = 603 - 3*T₁_rel - 201*T₁_rel + T₁_rel²`\n`T₁_rel² + 396*T₁_rel = 603 - 204*T₁_rel + T₁_rel²`\n\nCancel `T₁_rel²` from both sides:\n`396*T₁_rel = 603 - 204*T₁_rel`\n`600*T₁_rel = 603`\n`T₁_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 7. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\nDifference = `T₁_rel - T₁_cla`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus: E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV.\n    *   Initial momentum: P_initial = 0.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: m₁ = 2m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies T₁ and T₂, and momenta p₁ and p₂.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nFrom the given information, we can find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments:\n*   (m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300,000 MeV = 297,000 MeV.\n*   Since m₁ = 2m₂, we can write (2m₂ + m₂)c² = 3m₂c² = 297,000 MeV.\n*   Solving for m₂c², we get: m₂c² = 99,000 MeV.\n*   And for m₁c², we get: m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 198,000 MeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies, according to the principle of energy conservation.\n*   Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV = 3,000 MeV.\n\n### 4. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T₁\n\nIn classical mechanics, the conservation of momentum (P_initial = 0) means the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: p₁ = -p₂, so |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   The classical kinetic energy is given by T = p² / (2m).\n*   Therefore, T₁ = p² / (2m₁) and T₂ = p² / (2m₂).\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses: T₁ / T₂ = m₂ / m₁ = m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2.\n*   This implies T₂ = 2T₁.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: T₁ + T₂ = 3,000 MeV.\n*   Substituting T₂: T₁ + 2T₁ = 3T₁ = 3,000 MeV.\n*   This gives the classical value for T₁: **T₁ (classical) = 1,000 MeV**.\n\n### 5. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T₁\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we again use the conservation of momentum, |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum (p), energy (E), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   This can be rewritten as (pc)² = E² - (mc²)². Since the total energy is E = T + mc², we get (pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²).\n*   Since the momenta are equal: (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n*   T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²).\n*   We know T₂ = 3,000 - T₁. Substituting this and the mass-energy values into the equation:\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁(198,000) = (3,000 - T₁)² + 2(3,000 - T₁)(99,000)\n    *   T₁² + 396,000T₁ = (9,000,000 - 6,000T₁ + T₁²) + (594,000,000 - 198,000T₁)\n*   Simplifying the equation by canceling the T₁² terms on both sides:\n    *   396,000T₁ = 9,000,000 - 6,000T₁ + 594,000,000 - 198,000T₁\n    *   396,000T₁ = 603,000,000 - 204,000T₁\n*   Grouping the T₁ terms:\n    *   396,000T₁ + 204,000T₁ = 603,000,000\n    *   600,000T₁ = 603,000,000\n*   Solving for the relativistic T₁:\n    *   **T₁ (relativistic) = 603,000,000 / 600,000 = 1,005 MeV**.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\n*   Difference = 1,005 MeV - 1,000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
