Understand the Decay Process**\n\nThe decay is given by:\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu$\n\nThe initial particle, the positive pion ($\\pi^+$), is stationary.

Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nWe will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**a) Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n*   Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$): Since the pion is at rest, its energy is its rest energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   Final Energy ($E_{final}$): The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$). The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy (KE).\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n    $E_{final} = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2 + KE_{\\mu^+}) + (m_{\\nu_\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\nu_\\mu})$\n\n*   Equating initial and final energies:\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2 + KE_{\\mu^+}) + (m_{\\nu_\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\nu_\\mu})$\n    $139.6 \\text{ MeV} = (105.7 \\text{ MeV} + KE_{\\mu^+}) + (0 + KE_{\\nu_\\mu})$\n    $139.6 = 105.7 + KE_{\\mu^+} + KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n\n*   The total kinetic energy of the products is:\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} + KE_{\\nu_\\mu} = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**b) Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n*   Initial Momentum ($\\vec{p}_{initial}$): Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n    $\\vec{p}_{initial} = 0$\n\n*   Final Momentum ($\\vec{p}_{final}$): The final momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n\n*   Equating initial and final momenta:\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu_\\mu} = 0$\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu_\\mu}| = p$\n\n**4. Calculate the Momentum and Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, we know that for the massless neutrino, its energy is $E_{\\nu_\\mu} = pc$.\nSo, $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu_\\mu} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc$.\n\nNow, apply the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n$E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $E_{\\mu^+}$:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nExpand the left side:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nCancel the $(pc)^2$ term from both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nRearrange to solve for pc:\n$2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\nPlug in the given values:\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n$pc = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n$pc = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energies:\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$):**\n    For a massless particle, $KE = E = pc$.\n    $KE_{\\nu_\\mu} = 29.78 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):**\n    We can use the total kinetic energy we found earlier.\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = (KE_{total}) - KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nSo, the kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon ($\\mu^+$) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$).\n\nComparing this with the options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nMy initial calculation is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Calculation Steps:** The problem involves a two-body decay of a stationary particle. The key principles are the conservation of energy and momentum.\n    1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (π⁺) is at rest, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the final products, the muon (μ⁺) and the muon neutrino (ν), must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's call the magnitude of this momentum 'p'.\n    2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion (E_π = m_πc²). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n    3.  **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where m₀ is the rest mass.\n        *   For the muon: E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc²\n        *   For the neutrino, its rest mass is considered to be zero. Therefore, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, and E_ν = pc = KE_ν.\n\n*   **Solving for Kinetic Energies:**\n    1.  From energy conservation: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    2.  We can write E_μ as m_πc² - E_ν.\n    3.  Using the relativistic energy formula for the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)².\n    4.  Substitute the expressions for E_μ and pc: (m_πc² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)².\n    5.  Expanding and solving for E_ν (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy, KE_ν):\n        (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n        KE_ν = E_ν = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n    6.  Plugging in the given values:\n        KE_ν = [(139.6 MeV)² - (105.7 MeV)²] / [2 * 139.6 MeV]\n        KE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n        KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n    7.  Now, find the muon's kinetic energy (KE_μ) using energy conservation:\n        KE_μ = m_πc² - m_μc² - KE_ν\n        KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. Search results confirm these values, with one source calculating the muon kinetic energy to be 4.12 MeV and the neutrino kinetic energy to be 29.65 MeV. Another source states the muon kinetic energy is 4.13 MeV. These minor differences are due to slightly different values used for the rest masses of the particles. The values match option B most closely.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon (μ⁺): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino (ν): **29.8 MeV**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (pion, $\\pi^+$) into two other particles (muon, $\\mu^+$ and a neutrino, $\\nu$). This process must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the particles involved are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu}$ (where p is the magnitude of momentum).\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$). The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).\n    *   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino, we assume its rest mass is zero ($m_{\\nu} = 0$), so its energy is simply $E_{\\nu} = p_{\\nu}c$. The kinetic energy of a massless particle is its total energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu}$.\n\n4.  **Solve for Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   From momentum conservation and the neutrino's energy, we have $p_{\\mu}c = p_{\\nu}c = E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Substitute this into the energy conservation equation:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(KE_{\\nu})^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + KE_{\\nu}$\n    *   Rearranging and squaring this equation allows us to solve for the neutrino's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\nu}$):\n        $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n    *   Once we find $KE_{\\nu}$, we can find the muon's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\mu}$) using the total kinetic energy released in the decay (the Q-value):\n        $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n        $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$\n\n5.  **Python Implementation:** The following Python code will perform these calculations using the given rest mass values.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of Pi(+) in MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of mu(+) in MeV\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# Formula: KE_nu = (m_pi_c2^2 - m_mu_c2^2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n# Q = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE_mu = Q - KE_nu\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"B) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"C) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\")\n\n# Determine the correct option\nif abs(ke_mu - 4.12) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 29.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"A\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 3.52) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 20.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"B\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 7.2) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 32.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"C\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 2.84) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 26.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"D\"\nelse:\n    correct_option = \"None of the above\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated values match option {correct_option}.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: 4.12 MeV\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: 29.78 MeV\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option None of the above.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Decay Process and Conservation Laws**\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$). The reaction is:\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\nSince the pion is initially at rest, this decay must obey two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Assumptions**\n*   Initial particle: Pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Rest mass energy of muon ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV.\n*   **Assumption:** The neutrino ($\\nu$) is considered massless. Its rest mass energy ($m_{\\nu}c^2$) is 0. This is a standard and valid approximation for this type of problem.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n*   **Initial Momentum:** Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum ($p_{\\pi}$) is zero.\n*   **Final Momentum:** After the decay, the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Let their momenta be $\\vec{p}_{\\mu}$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n*   **Equation:**\n    $p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n    $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    This implies that their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total energy of the stationary pion is just its rest mass energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$). We must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (0)^2} = p_{\\nu}c$\n*   **Equation:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    Substituting the expressions for energy and using $p_{\\mu}c = p_{\\nu}c = pc$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**5. Solve for the Momentum (pc)**\nWe need to solve the energy conservation equation for the momentum magnitude `p` (or more conveniently, `pc`).\n1.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the square root term:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n2.  Square both sides of the equation:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}\\right)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n3.  The $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n4.  Solve for `pc`:\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6.

Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\nThe kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy ($KE = E - mc^2$).\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its rest energy is zero. Its total energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 = pc - 0 = pc$\n    $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n    Rounding to one decimal place gives **29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    We can find this using the total energy released in the decay (the Q-value). The initial mass energy is converted into the final rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy of the products.\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 4.12$ MeV\n\n**8.

Since the speeds of the product particles can be a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the products must also be zero.\n$\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\nThis means the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$) must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.

Solving for Momentum and Energies**\n\nWe can now solve this equation for the momentum term `pc`.\n1.  Rearrange the equation:\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n2.  Square both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n3.  Simplify by canceling the $(pc)^2$ term:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n4.

Now, substitute this into the relativistic energy-momentum equation for the muon:\n    *   (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n    *   pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n5.  **Calculating the Values**:\n    *   pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    *   pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n    *   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2\n    *   pc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n6.  **Finding the Kinetic Energies**:\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν)**: Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its momentum multiplied by c.\n        *   KE_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ)**: We can find this by subtracting the other energies from the initial energy.\n        *   KE_μ = m_πc² - m_μc² - KE_ν\n        *   KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n        *   KE_μ = 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.

Since the particles involved can travel at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The rest energy of the stationary initial particle (pion, $\\pi^+$) is converted into the total energy of the product particles (muon, $\\mu^+$ and neutrino, $\\nu$).\n        *   Initial Energy: $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n        *   Final Energy: $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} = (KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2) + KE_{\\nu}$ (assuming the neutrino is massless, its rest energy is zero, and its total energy is its kinetic energy).\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is stationary, its momentum is zero. The product particles must therefore move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n        *   Initial Momentum: $p_{initial} = 0$\n        *   Final Momentum: $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\implies p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu}$\n\n3.  **Derive Calculation Formulas:** By solving the system of equations derived from the conservation laws and the relativistic energy-momentum relation ($E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$), we can find the kinetic energy of the muon ($KE_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$). The simplified formulas are:\n    *   $KE_{\\mu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi} - m_{\\mu})^2 c^2}{2 m_{\\pi}}$\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} = Q - KE_{\\mu}$, where $Q = (m_{\\pi} - m_{\\mu})c^2$ is the total kinetic energy released.\n\n4.  **Execute the Code:** The Python code will use the given rest mass values (in MeV, so we can treat $c^2$ as 1) to calculate the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

This can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Setup:**\n*   **Decay reaction:** π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n*   The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero, and its initial energy is its rest mass energy.\n*   **Given masses:**\n    *   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n    *   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless, a standard assumption in this context.\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must be emitted in opposite directions with equal-magnitude momenta. Let 'p' be the magnitude of the momentum for both the muon and the neutrino.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the pion (E_π = m_πc²). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n\n*   E_π = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy for a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc. This energy is purely kinetic.\n*   For the massive muon: E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ) + pc\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nWe can now solve for the momentum (pc) and then find the kinetic energies.\n\nRearranging the energy equation to solve for pc:\nm_πc² - pc = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²) (pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe (pc)² terms cancel out. Solving for pc:\npc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\nPlugging in the given rest energy values:\npc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\npc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**5. Kinetic Energies:**\n\n*   **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n*   **Muon's Kinetic Energy (KE_μ):**\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy (KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²). We can also find it by subtracting the neutrino's energy from the total energy released.\n    Total energy released = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV.\n    This total released energy is shared as kinetic energy between the muon and the neutrino.\n    KE_μ = (Total energy released) - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.

Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum of the stationary pion is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n\n*   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (m_c²)².\n\n*   **For the neutrino (massless):** E_ν² = (pc)² + 0, which means E_ν = pc. Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (KE_ν = E_ν). Therefore, KE_ν = pc.\n*   **For the muon:** E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)². We also know that E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc².\n\n**4. Solving for the Kinetic Energies:**\nWe can now solve for the unknown kinetic energies. A straightforward method is to find the momentum (pc) first.\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can express the muon's energy as E_μ = E_π - E_ν = m_πc² - pc.\n\nNow, substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n\nNow, solve for pc:\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\npc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\npc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to this momentum value.\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon using the total kinetic energy calculated in step 1:\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated values are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.

List of Careful Points and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy `E` of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy `KE` and its rest mass energy `m*c^2`. So, `E = KE + m*c^2`.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The energy and momentum of a particle are related by the equation `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `p` is momentum and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Initial State:** The initial particle, the pion (Pi+), is stationary. This means its initial kinetic energy is zero, and its initial momentum is zero. Its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n*   **Neutrino Mass:** In this context, the neutrino (`nu`) is considered to be massless (`m_nu = 0`). This is a standard and very accurate approximation for such problems.\n*   **Consequences of a Massless Particle:** For a massless particle like the neutrino:\n    *   Its rest mass energy is zero (`m_nu*c^2 = 0`).\n    *   Its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (`E_nu = KE_nu`).\n    *   Its energy-momentum relation simplifies to `E_nu = p_nu * c`.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nLet the rest masses be `m_pi` and `m_mu`, and the momenta of the products be `p_mu` and `p_nu`. The kinetic energies are `KE_mu` and `KE_nu`.\n\n*   **Step 1: Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n    *   Initial momentum `p_initial = 0` (since Pi+ is at rest).\n    *   Final momentum `p_final = p_mu + p_nu` (vector sum).\n    *   By conservation, `p_initial = p_final`, so `0 = p_mu + p_nu`.\n    *   This implies the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n    *   `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply Conservation of Energy**\n    *   Initial energy `E_initial` is the rest energy of the pion: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n    *   Final energy `E_final` is the sum of the total energies of the muon and neutrino: `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   Using the energy-momentum relation for each particle:\n        *   `E_mu = sqrt((p_mu*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n        *   `E_nu = p_nu*c = p*c` (since the neutrino is massless)\n    *   Equating initial and final energies:\n        `m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n*   **Step 3: Solve for the Momentum `p`**\n    *   Rearrange the energy equation to isolate the square root term:\n        `m_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        `(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n        `(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    *   The `(p*c)^2` term cancels on both sides. Now, solve for `p*c`:\n        `2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n        `p*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi*c^2) ]`\n\n*   **Step 4: Substitute Numerical Values**\n    *   `m_pi*c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   `m_mu*c^2 = 105.7 MeV`\n    *   `p*c = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n    *   `p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    *   `p*c = [ 8315.67 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    *   `p*c = 29.78 MeV`\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Kinetic Energies**\n    *   **For the neutrino (nu):**\n        Since it's massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, `E_nu`.\n        `KE_nu = E_nu = p_nu*c = p*c`\n        `KE_nu = 29.78 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n    *   **For the muon (mu+):**\n        Its kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest energy: `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2`.\n        We can find `E_mu` from the conservation of energy: `E_mu = E_initial - E_nu`.\n        `E_mu = (m_pi*c^2) - (p*c)`\n        `E_mu = 139.6 MeV - 29.78 MeV = 109.82 MeV`\n        Now find the kinetic energy:\n        `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2 = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV`\n        `KE_mu = 4.12 MeV`\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (`mu+`) is 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino (`nu`) is 29.8 MeV. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energies (KE) of the two product particles.\n\n**1. Principles of Conservation**\n\nThis is a two-body decay problem governed by the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The pion is stationary.\n    *   Initial momentum (P_i) = 0\n    *   Initial energy (E_i) = Rest energy of the pion = m_pi * c^2\n\n*   **Final State:** The pion decays into a muon and a neutrino.\n    *   Final momentum (P_f) = p_mu + p_nu\n    *   Final energy (E_f) = E_mu + E_nu\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum must also be zero.\nP_i = P_f\n0 = p_mu + p_nu\nThis means the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe initial energy equals the total final energy.\nE_i = E_f\nm_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2 for each particle.\n\n*   **For the muon (mu+):** E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2\n*   **For the neutrino (nu):** A neutrino's rest mass is negligible (m_nu ≈ 0). Therefore, its energy is entirely kinetic: E_nu = KE_nu = |p_nu * c| = pc.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nLet's substitute the energy expressions back into the conservation of energy equation:\nm_pi * c^2 = E_mu + pc\n\nNow, we use the energy-momentum relation for the muon to create a second equation:\nE_mu^2 = (p_mu * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\nE_mu^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\n\nWe now have a system of two equations to solve. Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for pc and substitute it into the second equation:\nFrom `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + pc` => `pc = m_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\nE_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\nE_mu^2 = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\nThe E_mu^2 terms on both sides cancel out:\n0 = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\nNow, solve for the total energy of the muon, E_mu:\n2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu = (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\nE_mu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi * c^2 ]\n\nLet's plug in the given rest mass values (in MeV): m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.\nE_mu = [ (139.6)^2 + (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nE_mu = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / 279.2\nE_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy:\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2\nKE_mu = 109.82 - 105.7 = **4.12 MeV**\n\nNow, we find the kinetic energy of the neutrino. The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass between the initial and final states:\nQ = KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2\nKE_nu = (m_pi - m_mu) * c^2 - KE_mu\nKE_nu = (139.6 - 105.7) - 4.12\nKE_nu = 33.9 - 4.12 = **29.78 MeV**\n\nRounding the neutrino's kinetic energy to one decimal place gives 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   KE of mu(+) = 4.12 MeV\n*   KE of nu = 29.8 MeV\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n### Analysis of the Decay Process\n\nThe nuclear decay in question is the transformation of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. According to the principle of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino will travel in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n\n### Energy and Momentum Conservation\n\nThe decay process must also adhere to the law of conservation of energy. The total energy before the decay, which is the rest energy of the stationary pion, must equal the sum of the total energies of the product particles after the decay. The rest masses provided are 139.6 MeV/c² for the pion and 105.7 MeV/c² for the muon. The muon neutrino is considered to be massless for this calculation, which is a standard and accurate approximation in particle physics.\n\n### Calculation of Kinetic Energies\n\nUsing the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, we can derive a formula to calculate the kinetic energy (KE) of the muon. The formula is:\n\n**KE_μ = (m_π² - m_μ²) / (2 * m_π)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **KE_μ** is the kinetic energy of the muon.\n*   **m_π** is the rest mass of the pion (139.6 MeV/c²).\n*   **m_μ** is the rest mass of the muon (105.7 MeV/c²).\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nKE_μ = ( (139.6 MeV)² - (105.7 MeV)² ) / (2 * 139.6 MeV)\nKE_μ = (19488.16 MeV² - 11172.49 MeV²) / (279.2 MeV)\nKE_μ = 8315.67 MeV² / 279.2 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**\n\nThe total energy released in the decay is the difference between the pion's rest mass and the muon's rest mass, which is 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This energy is distributed as the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν) can then be found by subtracting the muon's kinetic energy from the total energy released:\n\nKE_ν = Total Energy Released - KE_μ\nKE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 4.12 MeV\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nThese calculated values for the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This result is consistent with experimental measurements and established physics models for pion decay.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n### Analysis of Pion Decay\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). To find the kinetic energies of the product particles, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, assuming the neutrino is massless, which is a standard approximation in this context.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_πc²) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μc²) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n*   E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n\nAfter the decay, this energy is distributed among the rest mass and kinetic energies of the resulting particles.\n*   E_final = (m_μc² + KE_μ) + (m_νc² + KE_ν)\n\nAssuming a massless neutrino (m_ν = 0), the equation becomes:\n*   139.6 MeV = (105.7 MeV + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n\nThe sum of the kinetic energies of the products is the Q-value of the decay:\n*   KE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino are emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (p).\n*   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nThe energy of the massless neutrino is given by E_ν = p*c. Since its rest mass is zero, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n*   KE_ν = p*c\n\nThe momentum p can be calculated from the conservation laws. A derived formula for the momentum of the decay products in a two-body decay from rest is:\n*   p*c = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2 * m_πc² ]\n*   p*c = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n*   p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\n*   p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is:\n*   KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe total energy of the muon is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_μ = √[(p*c)² + (m_μc²)²]. Its kinetic energy is KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc².\n*   E_μ = √[(29.78)² + (105.7)²] = √[886.85 + 11172.49] = √[12059.34] ≈ 109.81 MeV\n*   KE_μ = 109.81 MeV - 105.7 MeV ≈ 4.11 MeV\n\nThus, the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.\n\nThe final calculated values are:\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_μ):** ~4.12 MeV\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_ν):** ~29.8 MeV\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\nGiven:\n*   The pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered to have zero rest mass.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n*   **Before decay:** The pion is at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n\n*   **After decay:** The total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu). The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy (m*c²).\n    E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n    E_final = (KE_μ + m_μ*c²) + (KE_ν + m_ν*c²)\n\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is assumed to be zero (m_ν = 0), its energy is purely kinetic (E_ν = KE_ν).\n\n*   **Equating initial and final energies:**\n    m_π*c² = KE_μ + m_μ*c² + KE_ν\n    139.6 MeV = KE_μ + 105.7 MeV + KE_ν\n    KE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n    **KE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV** (This is the total kinetic energy released in the decay)\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n*   **Before decay:** The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n    p_initial = 0\n\n*   **After decay:** The muon and the neutrino move off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    p_final = p_μ + p_ν\n    0 = p_μ + p_ν  =>  p_μ = -p_ν\n\n    The magnitudes are equal: |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\nE² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²\n\n*   **For the neutrino (massless):**\n    E_ν² = (p*c)² + (0)²\n    E_ν = p*c\n    Since E_ν = KE_ν, we have **KE_ν = p*c**.\n\n*   **For the muon:**\n    E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    (KE_μ + m_μ*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\n**4. Solving for the Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe can substitute KE_ν for p*c in the muon's energy equation:\n(KE_μ + m_μ*c²)² = (KE_ν)² + (m_μ*c²)²\nKE_μ² + 2*KE_μ*(m_μ*c²) + (m_μ*c²)² = KE_ν² + (m_μ*c²)²\nKE_μ² + 2*KE_μ*(m_μ*c²) = KE_ν²\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  KE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV  =>  KE_ν = 33.9 - KE_μ\n2.  KE_ν² = KE_μ² + 2*KE_μ*(m_μ*c²)\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n(33.9 - KE_μ)² = KE_μ² + 2 * KE_μ * (105.7)\n(33.9)² - 2*(33.9)*KE_μ + KE_μ² = KE_μ² + 211.4*KE_μ\n1149.21 - 67.8*KE_μ = 211.4*KE_μ\n1149.21 = 211.4*KE_μ + 67.8*KE_μ\n1149.21 = 279.2*KE_μ\nKE_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**\n\nNow, find the neutrino's kinetic energy using equation (1):\nKE_ν = 33.9 - KE_μ\nKE_ν = 33.9 - 4.12\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.78 MeV** (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.

Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n\nThe total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n`E_initial = E_pi = m_pi * c²`\n\nThe total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n`E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`.\n`m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**5. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by the equation:\n`E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²`\n\n*   For the muon (`mu(+)`):\n    `E_mu² = (p c)² + (m_mu c²)²`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   For the neutrino (`nu`), since we assume its rest mass is zero (`m_nu = 0`):\n    `E_nu² = (p c)² + (0 * c²)² = (p c)²`\n    So, `E_nu = p c`.\n    This also means the total energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its kinetic energy (`KE_nu`).\n    `KE_nu = E_nu = p c` (Equation 2)\n\n**6. Solve for the energies:**\n\nFrom Equation 2, we can express `(p c)²` as `E_nu²`. Substitute this into Equation 1:\n`E_mu² = E_nu² + (m_mu c²)²`\n`E_mu² - E_nu² = (m_mu c²)²`\n`(E_mu - E_nu)(E_mu + E_nu) = (m_mu c²)²` (Equation 3)\n\nFrom the conservation of energy (`m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`), we can substitute `m_pi * c²` for `(E_mu + E_nu)` in Equation 3:\n`(E_mu - E_nu)(m_pi * c²) = (m_mu c²)²`\n`E_mu - E_nu = (m_mu² c⁴) / (m_pi c²) = (m_mu²/m_pi) * c²` (Equation 4)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E_mu` and `E_nu`:\n1.  `E_mu + E_nu = m_pi * c²`\n2.  `E_mu - E_nu = (m_mu²/m_pi) * c²`\n\nAdding these two equations gives:\n`2 * E_mu = (m_pi + m_mu²/m_pi) * c²`\n`E_mu = (m_pi² + m_mu²) / (2 * m_pi) * c²`\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`) is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n`KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c²`\n`KE_mu = [(m_pi² + m_mu²) / (2 * m_pi) - m_mu] * c²`\n`KE_mu = [(m_pi² + m_mu² - 2*m_pi*m_mu) / (2 * m_pi)] * c²`\n`KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)² / (2 * m_pi) * c²`\n\nNow, we can calculate `KE_mu` using the given masses:\n`KE_mu = (139.6 - 105.7)² / (2 * 139.6)` MeV\n`KE_mu = (33.9)² / (279.2)` MeV\n`KE_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2` MeV\n`KE_mu ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n\nNext, we find the kinetic energy of the neutrino, `KE_nu`.\nFrom the conservation of energy, the total kinetic energy released is the difference in rest mass energy:\n`Q = KE_mu + KE_nu = (m_pi - m_mu) * c²` (assuming `m_nu = 0`)\n`Q = (139.6 - 105.7) MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\n`KE_nu = Q - KE_mu`\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - 4.116` MeV\n`KE_nu ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of `mu(+)`: ~4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of `nu`: ~29.8 MeV\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis problem involves a classic two-body decay of a stationary particle. We will use the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity to solve it.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial particle, the pion (Pi+), is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the product particles—the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu)—must also be zero.\n*   This implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's denote this momentum magnitude as `p`.\n\n    `p_muon = p` and `p_neutrino = p`\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n*   The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`): `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n*   The law of conservation of energy states that `E_initial = E_final`.\n\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by the equation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   For the muon: `E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n*   For the neutrino, we assume its rest mass is negligible (`m_nu = 0`). Therefore, its energy is simply `E_nu = p*c`. Since its rest mass is zero, its total energy is purely kinetic energy, so `KE_nu = p*c`.\n\n**4. Solving for Momentum**\n\nWe substitute the energy expressions into the conservation equation:\n\n`m_pi*c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\nTo solve for `p*c`, we can rearrange and square the equation:\n\n1.  Isolate the square root: `m_pi*c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n2.  Square both sides: `(m_pi*c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n3.  Expand the left side: `(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n4.  Cancel the `(p*c)^2` term and solve for `p*c`:\n    `p*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]`\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug in the given rest mass energies: `m_pi*c^2 = 139.6 MeV` and `m_mu*c^2 = 105.7 MeV`.\n\n`p*c = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n`p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n`p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`p*c ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n**6. Finding the Kinetic Energies**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_nu):**\n    As established earlier, `KE_nu = p*c`.\n    `KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_mu):**\n    The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in the initial and final rest energies:\n    `KE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2`\n    `KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n    We can now find the muon's kinetic energy:\n    `KE_mu = KE_total - KE_nu`\n    `KE_mu = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV`\n    `KE_mu = 4.1 MeV`\n    (Using more precise values: 33.9 - 29.784 = 4.116 ≈ 4.12 MeV)\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe problem describes the two-body decay of a stationary positive pion (`Pi(+)`) into a positive muon (`mu(+)`) and a muon neutrino (`nu`). To find the kinetic energies (KE) of the product particles, we will apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial pion is stationary, so the total initial momentum is zero. By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n`p_mu = p_nu = p`\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion, `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino, `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n`m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is given by `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2`, where `p` is the momentum and `m_0` is the rest mass.\n\n*   For the muon (`mu+`): `E_mu = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n*   For the neutrino (`nu`): The rest mass of a neutrino is considered to be zero in this context. Thus, its energy is `E_nu = pc`. Since it's massless, all of its energy is kinetic energy, so `KE_nu = E_nu = pc`.\n\n**4. Solving for Momentum and Energies:**\nSubstitute the energy expressions into the energy conservation equation:\n`m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2) + pc`\n\nRearranging to solve for `pc`:\n`m_pi * c^2 - pc = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n\nSquare both sides:\n`(m_pi * c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n`(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi * c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nThe `(pc)^2` terms cancel out, simplifying the equation:\n`(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi * c^2)(pc) = (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nSolving for `pc`:\n`pc = [ (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c^2) ]`\n\nNow we can calculate the numerical values using the provided rest masses:\n`m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n`m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`\n\nThe python script calculated the following:\n*   `KE_nu = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n*   `KE_mu = (m_pi * c^2 - KE_nu) - m_mu * c^2 ≈ (139.6 - 29.8) - 105.7 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV`\n\nThe precise values calculated by the script are `KE_mu = 4.12 MeV` and `KE_nu = 29.78 MeV`. Rounding the neutrino's energy gives `29.8 MeV`.\n\nThese calculated values (`4.12 MeV` for the muon and `29.8 MeV` for the neutrino) match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nMy initial derivation and calculations are confirmed by the search results.\n\nSpecifically, the decay of a stationary pion into a muon and a neutrino is a classic two-body decay problem solvable with conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The rest energy of the stationary pion equals the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total energy released, also known as the Q-value, is the difference between the pion's rest mass and the muon's rest mass (since the neutrino is considered massless).\n    *   Q = (m_pi - m_mu) * c^2 = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This energy is distributed as kinetic energy between the two product particles.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest (initial momentum is zero), the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's call the magnitude of this momentum 'p'.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Kinematics**: Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation (E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2), we can solve for the individual energies and momenta.\n    *   For the massless neutrino, its energy (E_nu) is equal to its momentum times c (E_nu = pc). Therefore, its kinetic energy is also equal to pc.\n    *   For the muon, E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2.\n\nSolving these equations, as done in my scratchpad, gives the momentum of each particle and subsequently their kinetic energies. A detailed calculation gives the muon kinetic energy as approximately 4.12 MeV and the neutrino's energy as approximately 29.8 MeV. These values match one of the multiple-choice options. HyperPhysics also cites the muon's kinetic energy in this decay as 4.13 MeV. An academic paper from 1994 measured the momentum of the muon from pion decay at rest to be 29.79207 MeV/c, which corresponds to a neutrino energy of about 29.8 MeV and a muon kinetic energy of about 4.1 MeV, further confirming the result.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\n*   Neutrino (nu): 29.8 MeV\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1.

    "This problem requires finding the kinetic energies of the product particles—a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν)—from the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺).

This means the two products must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let this magnitude be `p`. So, `|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p`.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy must equal the sum of the total final energies of the products. `E_initial = E_μ + E_ν`.\n\n2.  **Use Relativistic Formulas:**\n    *   The particles will be moving at speeds significant enough to require relativistic formulas. The relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n    *   **For the muon (μ⁺):** A massive particle. Its total energy is `E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc²`, where `KE_μ` is its kinetic energy.\n    *   **For the neutrino (ν):** A crucial assumption is that the neutrino is massless (`m_ν = 0`). This is a standard and accurate approximation. For a massless particle:\n        *   Its total energy is `E_ν = pc`.\n        *   Its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, so `KE_ν = E_ν = pc`.\n\n3.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    We now combine the conservation laws to solve for the unknown energies.\n    *   From energy conservation: `m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν`.\n    *   Substitute `E_ν = pc`: `m_πc² = E_μ + pc`.

Calculate the Momentum and Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, we know that for the massless neutrino, its energy is $E_{\\nu_\\mu} = pc$.\nSo, $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu_\\mu} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc$.\n\nNow, apply the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n$E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $E_{\\mu^+}$:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nExpand the left side:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nCancel the $(pc)^2$ term from both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nRearrange to solve for pc:\n$2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\nPlug in the given values:\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n$pc = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n$pc = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energies:\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$):**\n    For a massless particle, $KE = E = pc$.\n    $KE_{\\nu_\\mu} = 29.78 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):**\n    We can use the total kinetic energy we found earlier.\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = (KE_{total}) - KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nSo, the kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon ($\\mu^+$) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$).\n\nComparing this with the options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nMy initial calculation is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Calculation Steps:** The problem involves a two-body decay of a stationary particle. The key principles are the conservation of energy and momentum.\n    1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (π⁺) is at rest, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the final products, the muon (μ⁺) and the muon neutrino (ν), must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's call the magnitude of this momentum 'p'.\n    2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion (E_π = m_πc²). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n    3.  **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where m₀ is the rest mass.\n        *   For the muon: E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc²\n        *   For the neutrino, its rest mass is considered to be zero. Therefore, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, and E_ν = pc = KE_ν.\n\n*   **Solving for Kinetic Energies:**\n    1.  From energy conservation: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    2.  We can write E_μ as m_πc² - E_ν.\n    3.  Using the relativistic energy formula for the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)².\n    4.  Substitute the expressions for E_μ and pc: (m_πc² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)².\n    5.  Expanding and solving for E_ν (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy, KE_ν):\n        (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n        KE_ν = E_ν = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n    6.  Plugging in the given values:\n        KE_ν = [(139.6 MeV)² - (105.7 MeV)²] / [2 * 139.6 MeV]\n        KE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n        KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n    7.  Now, find the muon's kinetic energy (KE_μ) using energy conservation:\n        KE_μ = m_πc² - m_μc² - KE_ν\n        KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. Search results confirm these values, with one source calculating the muon kinetic energy to be 4.12 MeV and the neutrino kinetic energy to be 29.65 MeV. Another source states the muon kinetic energy is 4.13 MeV. These minor differences are due to slightly different values used for the rest masses of the particles. The values match option B most closely.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon (μ⁺): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino (ν): **29.8 MeV**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (pion, $\\pi^+$) into two other particles (muon, $\\mu^+$ and a neutrino, $\\nu$). This process must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the particles involved are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu}$ (where p is the magnitude of momentum).\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$). The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).\n    *   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino, we assume its rest mass is zero ($m_{\\nu} = 0$), so its energy is simply $E_{\\nu} = p_{\\nu}c$. The kinetic energy of a massless particle is its total energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu}$.\n\n4.  **Solve for Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   From momentum conservation and the neutrino's energy, we have $p_{\\mu}c = p_{\\nu}c = E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Substitute this into the energy conservation equation:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(KE_{\\nu})^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + KE_{\\nu}$\n    *   Rearranging and squaring this equation allows us to solve for the neutrino's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\nu}$):\n        $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n    *   Once we find $KE_{\\nu}$, we can find the muon's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\mu}$) using the total kinetic energy released in the decay (the Q-value):\n        $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n        $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$\n\n5.  **Python Implementation:** The following Python code will perform these calculations using the given rest mass values.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of Pi(+) in MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of mu(+) in MeV\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# Formula: KE_nu = (m_pi_c2^2 - m_mu_c2^2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n# Q = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE_mu = Q - KE_nu\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"B) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"C) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\")\n\n# Determine the correct option\nif abs(ke_mu - 4.12) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 29.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"A\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 3.52) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 20.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"B\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 7.2) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 32.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"C\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 2.84) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 26.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"D\"\nelse:\n    correct_option = \"None of the above\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated values match option {correct_option}.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: 4.12 MeV\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: 29.78 MeV\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option None of the above.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1.

Since the particles involved can travel at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The rest energy of the stationary initial particle (pion, $\\pi^+$) is converted into the total energy of the product particles (muon, $\\mu^+$ and neutrino, $\\nu$).\n        *   Initial Energy: $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n        *   Final Energy: $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} = (KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2) + KE_{\\nu}$ (assuming the neutrino is massless, its rest energy is zero, and its total energy is its kinetic energy).\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is stationary, its momentum is zero. The product particles must therefore move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n        *   Initial Momentum: $p_{initial} = 0$\n        *   Final Momentum: $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\implies p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu}$\n\n3.  **Derive Calculation Formulas:** By solving the system of equations derived from the conservation laws and the relativistic energy-momentum relation ($E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$), we can find the kinetic energy of the muon ($KE_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$). The simplified formulas are:\n    *   $KE_{\\mu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi} - m_{\\mu})^2 c^2}{2 m_{\\pi}}$\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} = Q - KE_{\\mu}$, where $Q = (m_{\\pi} - m_{\\mu})c^2$ is the total kinetic energy released.\n\n4.  **Execute the Code:** The Python code will use the given rest mass values (in MeV, so we can treat $c^2$ as 1) to calculate the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

This can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Setup:**\n*   **Decay reaction:** π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n*   The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero, and its initial energy is its rest mass energy.\n*   **Given masses:**\n    *   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n    *   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless, a standard assumption in this context.\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must be emitted in opposite directions with equal-magnitude momenta. Let 'p' be the magnitude of the momentum for both the muon and the neutrino.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the pion (E_π = m_πc²). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n\n*   E_π = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy for a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc. This energy is purely kinetic.\n*   For the massive muon: E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ) + pc\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nWe can now solve for the momentum (pc) and then find the kinetic energies.\n\nRearranging the energy equation to solve for pc:\nm_πc² - pc = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²) (pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe (pc)² terms cancel out. Solving for pc:\npc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\nPlugging in the given rest energy values:\npc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\npc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**5. Kinetic Energies:**\n\n*   **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n*   **Muon's Kinetic Energy (KE_μ):**\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy (KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²). We can also find it by subtracting the neutrino's energy from the total energy released.\n    Total energy released = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV.\n    This total released energy is shared as kinetic energy between the muon and the neutrino.\n    KE_μ = (Total energy released) - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.

Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum of the stationary pion is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n\n*   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (m_c²)².\n\n*   **For the neutrino (massless):** E_ν² = (pc)² + 0, which means E_ν = pc. Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (KE_ν = E_ν). Therefore, KE_ν = pc.\n*   **For the muon:** E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)². We also know that E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc².\n\n**4. Solving for the Kinetic Energies:**\nWe can now solve for the unknown kinetic energies. A straightforward method is to find the momentum (pc) first.\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can express the muon's energy as E_μ = E_π - E_ν = m_πc² - pc.\n\nNow, substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n\nNow, solve for pc:\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\npc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\npc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to this momentum value.\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon using the total kinetic energy calculated in step 1:\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated values are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.

List of Careful Points and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy `E` of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy `KE` and its rest mass energy `m*c^2`. So, `E = KE + m*c^2`.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The energy and momentum of a particle are related by the equation `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `p` is momentum and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Initial State:** The initial particle, the pion (Pi+), is stationary. This means its initial kinetic energy is zero, and its initial momentum is zero. Its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n*   **Neutrino Mass:** In this context, the neutrino (`nu`) is considered to be massless (`m_nu = 0`). This is a standard and very accurate approximation for such problems.\n*   **Consequences of a Massless Particle:** For a massless particle like the neutrino:\n    *   Its rest mass energy is zero (`m_nu*c^2 = 0`).\n    *   Its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (`E_nu = KE_nu`).\n    *   Its energy-momentum relation simplifies to `E_nu = p_nu * c`.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nLet the rest masses be `m_pi` and `m_mu`, and the momenta of the products be `p_mu` and `p_nu`. The kinetic energies are `KE_mu` and `KE_nu`.\n\n*   **Step 1: Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n    *   Initial momentum `p_initial = 0` (since Pi+ is at rest).\n    *   Final momentum `p_final = p_mu + p_nu` (vector sum).\n    *   By conservation, `p_initial = p_final`, so `0 = p_mu + p_nu`.\n    *   This implies the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n    *   `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply Conservation of Energy**\n    *   Initial energy `E_initial` is the rest energy of the pion: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n    *   Final energy `E_final` is the sum of the total energies of the muon and neutrino: `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   Using the energy-momentum relation for each particle:\n        *   `E_mu = sqrt((p_mu*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n        *   `E_nu = p_nu*c = p*c` (since the neutrino is massless)\n    *   Equating initial and final energies:\n        `m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n*   **Step 3: Solve for the Momentum `p`**\n    *   Rearrange the energy equation to isolate the square root term:\n        `m_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        `(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n        `(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    *   The `(p*c)^2` term cancels on both sides. Now, solve for `p*c`:\n        `2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n        `p*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi*c^2) ]`\n\n*   **Step 4: Substitute Numerical Values**\n    *   `m_pi*c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   `m_mu*c^2 = 105.7 MeV`\n    *   `p*c = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n    *   `p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    *   `p*c = [ 8315.67 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    *   `p*c = 29.78 MeV`\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Kinetic Energies**\n    *   **For the neutrino (nu):**\n        Since it's massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, `E_nu`.\n        `KE_nu = E_nu = p_nu*c = p*c`\n        `KE_nu = 29.78 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n    *   **For the muon (mu+):**\n        Its kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest energy: `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2`.\n        We can find `E_mu` from the conservation of energy: `E_mu = E_initial - E_nu`.\n        `E_mu = (m_pi*c^2) - (p*c)`\n        `E_mu = 139.6 MeV - 29.78 MeV = 109.82 MeV`\n        Now find the kinetic energy:\n        `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2 = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV`\n        `KE_mu = 4.12 MeV`\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (`mu+`) is 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino (`nu`) is 29.8 MeV. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energies (KE) of the two product particles.\n\n**1. Principles of Conservation**\n\nThis is a two-body decay problem governed by the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The pion is stationary.\n    *   Initial momentum (P_i) = 0\n    *   Initial energy (E_i) = Rest energy of the pion = m_pi * c^2\n\n*   **Final State:** The pion decays into a muon and a neutrino.\n    *   Final momentum (P_f) = p_mu + p_nu\n    *   Final energy (E_f) = E_mu + E_nu\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum must also be zero.\nP_i = P_f\n0 = p_mu + p_nu\nThis means the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe initial energy equals the total final energy.\nE_i = E_f\nm_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2 for each particle.\n\n*   **For the muon (mu+):** E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2\n*   **For the neutrino (nu):** A neutrino's rest mass is negligible (m_nu ≈ 0). Therefore, its energy is entirely kinetic: E_nu = KE_nu = |p_nu * c| = pc.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nLet's substitute the energy expressions back into the conservation of energy equation:\nm_pi * c^2 = E_mu + pc\n\nNow, we use the energy-momentum relation for the muon to create a second equation:\nE_mu^2 = (p_mu * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\nE_mu^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\n\nWe now have a system of two equations to solve. Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for pc and substitute it into the second equation:\nFrom `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + pc` => `pc = m_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\nE_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\nE_mu^2 = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\nThe E_mu^2 terms on both sides cancel out:\n0 = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\nNow, solve for the total energy of the muon, E_mu:\n2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu = (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\nE_mu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi * c^2 ]\n\nLet's plug in the given rest mass values (in MeV): m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.\nE_mu = [ (139.6)^2 + (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nE_mu = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / 279.2\nE_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy:\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2\nKE_mu = 109.82 - 105.7 = **4.12 MeV**\n\nNow, we find the kinetic energy of the neutrino. The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass between the initial and final states:\nQ = KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2\nKE_nu = (m_pi - m_mu) * c^2 - KE_mu\nKE_nu = (139.6 - 105.7) - 4.12\nKE_nu = 33.9 - 4.12 = **29.78 MeV**\n\nRounding the neutrino's kinetic energy to one decimal place gives 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   KE of mu(+) = 4.12 MeV\n*   KE of nu = 29.8 MeV\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n### Analysis of the Decay Process\n\nThe nuclear decay in question is the transformation of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. According to the principle of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino will travel in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n\n### Energy and Momentum Conservation\n\nThe decay process must also adhere to the law of conservation of energy. The total energy before the decay, which is the rest energy of the stationary pion, must equal the sum of the total energies of the product particles after the decay. The rest masses provided are 139.6 MeV/c² for the pion and 105.7 MeV/c² for the muon. The muon neutrino is considered to be massless for this calculation, which is a standard and accurate approximation in particle physics.\n\n### Calculation of Kinetic Energies\n\nUsing the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, we can derive a formula to calculate the kinetic energy (KE) of the muon. The formula is:\n\n**KE_μ = (m_π² - m_μ²) / (2 * m_π)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **KE_μ** is the kinetic energy of the muon.\n*   **m_π** is the rest mass of the pion (139.6 MeV/c²).\n*   **m_μ** is the rest mass of the muon (105.7 MeV/c²).\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nKE_μ = ( (139.6 MeV)² - (105.7 MeV)² ) / (2 * 139.6 MeV)\nKE_μ = (19488.16 MeV² - 11172.49 MeV²) / (279.2 MeV)\nKE_μ = 8315.67 MeV² / 279.2 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**\n\nThe total energy released in the decay is the difference between the pion's rest mass and the muon's rest mass, which is 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This energy is distributed as the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν) can then be found by subtracting the muon's kinetic energy from the total energy released:\n\nKE_ν = Total Energy Released - KE_μ\nKE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 4.12 MeV\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nThese calculated values for the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This result is consistent with experimental measurements and established physics models for pion decay.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n### Analysis of Pion Decay\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). To find the kinetic energies of the product particles, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, assuming the neutrino is massless, which is a standard approximation in this context.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_πc²) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μc²) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n*   E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n\nAfter the decay, this energy is distributed among the rest mass and kinetic energies of the resulting particles.\n*   E_final = (m_μc² + KE_μ) + (m_νc² + KE_ν)\n\nAssuming a massless neutrino (m_ν = 0), the equation becomes:\n*   139.6 MeV = (105.7 MeV + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n\nThe sum of the kinetic energies of the products is the Q-value of the decay:\n*   KE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino are emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (p).\n*   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nThe energy of the massless neutrino is given by E_ν = p*c. Since its rest mass is zero, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n*   KE_ν = p*c\n\nThe momentum p can be calculated from the conservation laws. A derived formula for the momentum of the decay products in a two-body decay from rest is:\n*   p*c = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2 * m_πc² ]\n*   p*c = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n*   p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\n*   p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is:\n*   KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe total energy of the muon is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_μ = √[(p*c)² + (m_μc²)²]. Its kinetic energy is KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc².\n*   E_μ = √[(29.78)² + (105.7)²] = √[886.85 + 11172.49] = √[12059.34] ≈ 109.81 MeV\n*   KE_μ = 109.81 MeV - 105.7 MeV ≈ 4.11 MeV\n\nThus, the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.\n\nThe final calculated values are:\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_μ):** ~4.12 MeV\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_ν):** ~29.8 MeV\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\nGiven:\n*   The pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered to have zero rest mass.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n*   **Before decay:** The pion is at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n\n*   **After decay:** The total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu). The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy (m*c²).\n    E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n    E_final = (KE_μ + m_μ*c²) + (KE_ν + m_ν*c²)\n\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is assumed to be zero (m_ν = 0), its energy is purely kinetic (E_ν = KE_ν).\n\n*   **Equating initial and final energies:**\n    m_π*c² = KE_μ + m_μ*c² + KE_ν\n    139.6 MeV = KE_μ + 105.7 MeV + KE_ν\n    KE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n    **KE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV** (This is the total kinetic energy released in the decay)\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n*   **Before decay:** The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n    p_initial = 0\n\n*   **After decay:** The muon and the neutrino move off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    p_final = p_μ + p_ν\n    0 = p_μ + p_ν  =>  p_μ = -p_ν\n\n    The magnitudes are equal: |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\nE² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²\n\n*   **For the neutrino (massless):**\n    E_ν² = (p*c)² + (0)²\n    E_ν = p*c\n    Since E_ν = KE_ν, we have **KE_ν = p*c**.\n\n*   **For the muon:**\n    E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    (KE_μ + m_μ*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\n**4. Solving for the Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe can substitute KE_ν for p*c in the muon's energy equation:\n(KE_μ + m_μ*c²)² = (KE_ν)² + (m_μ*c²)²\nKE_μ² + 2*KE_μ*(m_μ*c²) + (m_μ*c²)² = KE_ν² + (m_μ*c²)²\nKE_μ² + 2*KE_μ*(m_μ*c²) = KE_ν²\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  KE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV  =>  KE_ν = 33.9 - KE_μ\n2.  KE_ν² = KE_μ² + 2*KE_μ*(m_μ*c²)\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n(33.9 - KE_μ)² = KE_μ² + 2 * KE_μ * (105.7)\n(33.9)² - 2*(33.9)*KE_μ + KE_μ² = KE_μ² + 211.4*KE_μ\n1149.21 - 67.8*KE_μ = 211.4*KE_μ\n1149.21 = 211.4*KE_μ + 67.8*KE_μ\n1149.21 = 279.2*KE_μ\nKE_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**\n\nNow, find the neutrino's kinetic energy using equation (1):\nKE_ν = 33.9 - KE_μ\nKE_ν = 33.9 - 4.12\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.78 MeV** (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.

Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by the equation:\n`E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²`\n\n*   For the muon (`mu(+)`):\n    `E_mu² = (p c)² + (m_mu c²)²`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   For the neutrino (`nu`), since we assume its rest mass is zero (`m_nu = 0`):\n    `E_nu² = (p c)² + (0 * c²)² = (p c)²`\n    So, `E_nu = p c`.\n    This also means the total energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its kinetic energy (`KE_nu`).\n    `KE_nu = E_nu = p c` (Equation 2)\n\n**6. Solve for the energies:**\n\nFrom Equation 2, we can express `(p c)²` as `E_nu²`. Substitute this into Equation 1:\n`E_mu² = E_nu² + (m_mu c²)²`\n`E_mu² - E_nu² = (m_mu c²)²`\n`(E_mu - E_nu)(E_mu + E_nu) = (m_mu c²)²` (Equation 3)\n\nFrom the conservation of energy (`m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`), we can substitute `m_pi * c²` for `(E_mu + E_nu)` in Equation 3:\n`(E_mu - E_nu)(m_pi * c²) = (m_mu c²)²`\n`E_mu - E_nu = (m_mu² c⁴) / (m_pi c²) = (m_mu²/m_pi) * c²` (Equation 4)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E_mu` and `E_nu`:\n1.  `E_mu + E_nu = m_pi * c²`\n2.  `E_mu - E_nu = (m_mu²/m_pi) * c²`\n\nAdding these two equations gives:\n`2 * E_mu = (m_pi + m_mu²/m_pi) * c²`\n`E_mu = (m_pi² + m_mu²) / (2 * m_pi) * c²`\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`) is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n`KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c²`\n`KE_mu = [(m_pi² + m_mu²) / (2 * m_pi) - m_mu] * c²`\n`KE_mu = [(m_pi² + m_mu² - 2*m_pi*m_mu) / (2 * m_pi)] * c²`\n`KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)² / (2 * m_pi) * c²`\n\nNow, we can calculate `KE_mu` using the given masses:\n`KE_mu = (139.6 - 105.7)² / (2 * 139.6)` MeV\n`KE_mu = (33.9)² / (279.2)` MeV\n`KE_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2` MeV\n`KE_mu ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n\nNext, we find the kinetic energy of the neutrino, `KE_nu`.\nFrom the conservation of energy, the total kinetic energy released is the difference in rest mass energy:\n`Q = KE_mu + KE_nu = (m_pi - m_mu) * c²` (assuming `m_nu = 0`)\n`Q = (139.6 - 105.7) MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\n`KE_nu = Q - KE_mu`\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - 4.116` MeV\n`KE_nu ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of `mu(+)`: ~4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of `nu`: ~29.8 MeV\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis problem involves a classic two-body decay of a stationary particle. We will use the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity to solve it.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial particle, the pion (Pi+), is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the product particles—the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu)—must also be zero.\n*   This implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's denote this momentum magnitude as `p`.\n\n    `p_muon = p` and `p_neutrino = p`\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n*   The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`): `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n*   The law of conservation of energy states that `E_initial = E_final`.\n\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by the equation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   For the muon: `E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n*   For the neutrino, we assume its rest mass is negligible (`m_nu = 0`). Therefore, its energy is simply `E_nu = p*c`. Since its rest mass is zero, its total energy is purely kinetic energy, so `KE_nu = p*c`.\n\n**4. Solving for Momentum**\n\nWe substitute the energy expressions into the conservation equation:\n\n`m_pi*c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\nTo solve for `p*c`, we can rearrange and square the equation:\n\n1.  Isolate the square root: `m_pi*c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n2.  Square both sides: `(m_pi*c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n3.  Expand the left side: `(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n4.  Cancel the `(p*c)^2` term and solve for `p*c`:\n    `p*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]`\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug in the given rest mass energies: `m_pi*c^2 = 139.6 MeV` and `m_mu*c^2 = 105.7 MeV`.\n\n`p*c = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n`p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n`p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`p*c ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n**6. Finding the Kinetic Energies**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_nu):**\n    As established earlier, `KE_nu = p*c`.\n    `KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_mu):**\n    The total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the difference in the initial and final rest energies:\n    `KE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2`\n    `KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n    We can now find the muon's kinetic energy:\n    `KE_mu = KE_total - KE_nu`\n    `KE_mu = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV`\n    `KE_mu = 4.1 MeV`\n    (Using more precise values: 33.9 - 29.784 = 4.116 ≈ 4.12 MeV)\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe problem describes the two-body decay of a stationary positive pion (`Pi(+)`) into a positive muon (`mu(+)`) and a muon neutrino (`nu`). To find the kinetic energies (KE) of the product particles, we will apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial pion is stationary, so the total initial momentum is zero. By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n`p_mu = p_nu = p`\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion, `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino, `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n`m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is given by `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2`, where `p` is the momentum and `m_0` is the rest mass.\n\n*   For the muon (`mu+`): `E_mu = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n*   For the neutrino (`nu`): The rest mass of a neutrino is considered to be zero in this context. Thus, its energy is `E_nu = pc`. Since it's massless, all of its energy is kinetic energy, so `KE_nu = E_nu = pc`.\n\n**4. Solving for Momentum and Energies:**\nSubstitute the energy expressions into the energy conservation equation:\n`m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2) + pc`\n\nRearranging to solve for `pc`:\n`m_pi * c^2 - pc = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n\nSquare both sides:\n`(m_pi * c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n`(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi * c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nThe `(pc)^2` terms cancel out, simplifying the equation:\n`(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi * c^2)(pc) = (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nSolving for `pc`:\n`pc = [ (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c^2) ]`\n\nNow we can calculate the numerical values using the provided rest masses:\n`m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n`m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`\n\nThe python script calculated the following:\n*   `KE_nu = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n*   `KE_mu = (m_pi * c^2 - KE_nu) - m_mu * c^2 ≈ (139.6 - 29.8) - 105.7 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV`\n\nThe precise values calculated by the script are `KE_mu = 4.12 MeV` and `KE_nu = 29.78 MeV`. Rounding the neutrino's energy gives `29.8 MeV`.\n\nThese calculated values (`4.12 MeV` for the muon and `29.8 MeV` for the neutrino) match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nMy initial derivation and calculations are confirmed by the search results.\n\nSpecifically, the decay of a stationary pion into a muon and a neutrino is a classic two-body decay problem solvable with conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The rest energy of the stationary pion equals the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total energy released, also known as the Q-value, is the difference between the pion's rest mass and the muon's rest mass (since the neutrino is considered massless).\n    *   Q = (m_pi - m_mu) * c^2 = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This energy is distributed as kinetic energy between the two product particles.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest (initial momentum is zero), the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's call the magnitude of this momentum 'p'.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Kinematics**: Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation (E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2), we can solve for the individual energies and momenta.\n    *   For the massless neutrino, its energy (E_nu) is equal to its momentum times c (E_nu = pc). Therefore, its kinetic energy is also equal to pc.\n    *   For the muon, E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2.\n\nSolving these equations, as done in my scratchpad, gives the momentum of each particle and subsequently their kinetic energies. A detailed calculation gives the muon kinetic energy as approximately 4.12 MeV and the neutrino's energy as approximately 29.8 MeV. These values match one of the multiple-choice options. HyperPhysics also cites the muon's kinetic energy in this decay as 4.13 MeV. An academic paper from 1994 measured the momentum of the muon from pion decay at rest to be 29.79207 MeV/c, which corresponds to a neutrino energy of about 29.8 MeV and a muon kinetic energy of about 4.1 MeV, further confirming the result.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\n*   Neutrino (nu): 29.8 MeV\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1.
