    "1.  **Identify the nucleus and its properties:**\n    *   The element is Lithium (Li), which has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n    *   The problem states it has 3 neutrons (N).\n    *   The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   The nucleus is therefore a Lithium-6 isotope, denoted as $^6Li$.\n\n2.  **Determine the rest mass of the nucleus:**\n    *   To calculate the energy, we first need the rest mass ($m_0$) of the $^6Li$ nucleus.\n    *   We can find the atomic mass of the $^6Li$ atom, which is a well-tabulated value. The atomic mass includes the mass of its electrons.\n    *   The atomic mass of a $^6Li$ atom is approximately 6.015122795 atomic mass units (amu).\n    *   The mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of its electrons. A Lithium atom has 3 electrons.\n    *   The mass of a single electron is approximately 0.00054858 amu.\n    *   Mass of the nucleus in amu = Atomic mass - (3 * mass of an electron)\n        Mass of $^6Li$ nucleus = 6.0151228 amu - (3 * 0.00054858 amu) ≈ 6.01347706 amu.\n\n3.  **Convert the rest mass to energy units (GeV):**\n    *   The energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit (amu) is approximately 931.494 MeV/c². This can be expressed as 0.931494 GeV/c².\n    *   The rest mass energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$) of the nucleus is:\n        $E_0 = 6.01347706 \\text{ amu} \\times 0.931494 \\text{ GeV/amu} \\approx 5.60152 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total relativistic energy:**\n    *   The total energy (E) of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:\n        $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2 = \\gamma E_0$\n    *   Where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n    *   The problem states the speed of the nucleus (v) is 0.96c.\n    *   Now, we calculate the Lorentz factor:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n        $\\gamma = 3.57142857...$\n\n5.  **Compute the final total energy:**\n    *   Now, we can find the total energy E:\n        $E = \\gamma E_0 = 3.57142857 \\times 5.60152 \\text{ GeV} \\approx 20.0054 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nTo ensure precision and avoid rounding errors, the calculation can be done in a single step using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\natomic_mass_Li6 = 6.015122795  # in atomic mass units (amu)\nmass_electron_amu = 0.00054858  # in amu\namu_to_GeV = 0.93149410242   # Conversion factor from amu to GeV/c^2\n\n# Particle properties\nnum_electrons = 3\nspeed_c = 0.96\n\n# Calculate the mass of the Li-6 nucleus\nmass_nucleus_amu = atomic_mass_Li6 - (num_electrons * mass_electron_amu)\n\n# Calculate the rest energy (E0) of the nucleus in GeV\nE0_GeV = mass_nucleus_amu * amu_to_GeV\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - speed_c**2)\n\n# Calculate the total relativistic energy (E)\ntotal_energy_GeV = gamma * E0_GeV\n\nprint(f\"{total_energy_GeV:.4f}\")\n```\nThe execution of the above code yields an energy of **20.0054 GeV**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 21.419 GeV\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.0054 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV. The small discrepancy (~0.6%) might arise from using a slightly different value for the atomic mass unit to MeV/c² conversion (e.g., the commonly used approximation 931.5 MeV/amu) or the atomic mass of Li-6. However, it is by far the closest answer.\n\nFor instance, using the approximation $1 \\text{ amu} \\approx 931.5 \\text{ MeV/c}^2$:\n$E_0 = 6.013477 \\times 931.5 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 5601.55 \\text{ MeV} = 5.60155 \\text{ GeV}$\n$E = \\gamma E_0 = 3.5714 \\times 5.60155 \\text{ GeV} \\approx 20.0055 \\text{ GeV}$, which leads to the same conclusion.\n\nLet's quickly check the total mass (not subtracting electrons) which would be incorrect but might explain the option C:\n$E_{0,atom} = 6.0151228 \\text{ amu} \\times 0.931494 \\text{ GeV/amu} \\approx 5.60334 \\text{ GeV}$\n$E_{total,atom} = 3.5714 \\times 5.60334 \\text{ GeV} \\approx 20.012 \\text{ GeV}$. This is still not 20.132 GeV.\n\nLet's assume the energy 20.132 GeV is correct and work backward to find the rest mass required.\n$E_0 = E / \\gamma = 20.132 / 3.5714 = 5.637 \\text{ GeV}$. This corresponds to a mass of $5.637 / 0.9315 \\approx 6.051 \\text{ amu}$, which is close to the mass number A=6. Some simplified calculations in textbook problems use the mass number (A) as an integer approximation for the mass in amu. Let's test this:\n$E_0 = 6 \\text{ amu} \\times 931.5 \\text{ MeV/amu} = 5589 \\text{ MeV} = 5.589 \\text{ GeV}$\n$E = \\gamma E_0 = 3.5714 \\times 5.589 \\text{ GeV} = 19.96 \\text{ GeV}$. This is also very close to 20 GeV.\n\nGiven the choices, 20.132 GeV is the most plausible answer, differing by only a small margin from the precise calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "My calculated result is 20.0054 GeV. This result is obtained by using high-precision values for the physical constants and the standard relativistic energy formula.\n\nLet's analyze the options provided:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 21.419\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nMy calculated value, 20.0054 GeV, does not exactly match any of the options. However, it is closest to option C, 20.132 GeV. The difference is approximately 0.127 GeV, which is about a 0.6% discrepancy.\n\nSuch discrepancies in physics problems can sometimes arise from:\n1.  Using different (e.g., less precise or slightly older) values for physical constants like atomic masses or the amu-to-energy conversion factor.\n2.  Using an approximation for the mass. A common approximation is to calculate the mass by simply summing the masses of the constituent protons and neutrons, which ignores the binding energy of the nucleus.\n\nLet's test the second possibility (sum of constituent masses):\n*   Mass of a proton ($m_p$) ≈ 1.007276 amu\n*   Mass of a neutron ($m_n$) ≈ 1.008665 amu\n*   The nucleus is $^6Li$, containing 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n*   Approximate mass = 3 * $m_p$ + 3 * $m_n$ = 3 * (1.007276 + 1.008665) amu = 3 * (2.015941) amu = 6.047823 amu.\n*   Rest energy ($E_0$) = 6.047823 amu * 0.931494 GeV/amu ≈ 5.63345 GeV.\n*   Total Energy (E) = $\\gamma * E_0$. We already calculated $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2} = 1 / 0.28 \\approx 3.5714$.\n*   E = 3.5714 * 5.63345 GeV ≈ 20.119 GeV.\n\nThis result, 20.119 GeV, is extremely close to option C, 20.132 GeV. The small remaining difference is likely due to the exact values of the constants used to formulate the question. This method (using constituent mass) provides a much closer answer than the more physically accurate method (using the actual measured nuclear mass, which gave 20.0054 GeV).\n\nTherefore, it is most probable that the question intended for the solver to use the sum of the constituent nucleon masses. Based on this reasoning, option C is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
