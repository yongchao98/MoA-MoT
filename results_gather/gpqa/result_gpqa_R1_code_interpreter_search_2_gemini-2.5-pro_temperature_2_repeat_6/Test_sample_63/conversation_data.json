    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of the Decomposition**\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes, and we can identify the components and their quantities from the weight changes of the tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of the tube increased by 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The weight did not change.\n    *   This indicates that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (or other oxidizing gases like N₂O). The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This weight gain is purely from the oxygen atoms.\n    *   Let's analyze two possibilities for the gas reacting with Cu:\n        *   **Case a) The gas is O₂:** The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase is the mass of O₂.\n            *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n            *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32 g/mol.\n            *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n        *   **Case b) The gas is N₂O:** The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. The mass increase is due to the oxygen atom.\n            *   Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n            *   Molar mass of O = 16 g/mol.\n            *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This means 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with H₂O or O₂ absorbers, nor with hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂), which is very inert.\n\n**2. Mass Balance and Confirmation of Products**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salts. Assuming Gas C is N₂. The total mass of the initial gaseous products is the sum of the mass of water, the mass of the gas absorbed by copper (O₂ or N₂O), and the mass of the final gas (N₂).\nTotal Mass = (Mass of H₂O) + (Mass of substance absorbed by Tube 3) + (Mass of Gas C)\nLet's use the elements:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O in Tube 3 = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (Gas C, plus any N₂ produced in Tube 3)\nLet's check the total mass using elements which must be conserved from start to finish.\nThe products are composed of H, O, and N. Total mass = m(H₂O) + m(O in CuO) + m(N₂ in final gas) = 3.60g + 0.80g + (0.10 mol * 28 g/mol) = 3.60g + 0.80g + 2.80g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass exactly. This confirms that the salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen, and they decomposed fully into H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen-containing gas (like O₂ or N₂O).\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nSince the products contain N, H, and O, and the reactants are salts, the most likely candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions, such as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let's test this hypothesis.\nThe mixture is equimolar. Let 'x' be the moles of salt A and 'x' be the moles of salt B.\n\nWe'll test the two reaction pathways identified earlier.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Decomposition yields H₂O, O₂, and N₂**\n    This implies the following reactions:\n    A: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    B: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (or, per mole: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O)\n    From an initial mixture of `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₃:\n    *   Total H₂O produced = (2*x from A) + (2*x from B) = 4x\n    *   Total N₂ produced = (x from A) + (x from B) = 2x\n    *   Total O₂ produced = (0 from A) + (0.5*x from B) = 0.5x\n    Now we match this with the experimental quantities:\n    *   Moles H₂O: 4x = 0.20 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles N₂:   2x = 0.10 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles O₂: 0.5x = 0.025 mol =>  x = 0.05 mol\n    All calculations yield a consistent value of x = 0.05 mol. This confirms the identities of the salts.\n\nLet's check the initial mass:\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (moles of A * M(A)) + (moles of B * M(B))\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass. The hypothesis is correct. Salts A and B are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n*(Note: The second scenario, where NH₄NO₃ decomposes into N₂O + 2H₂O, also works out perfectly with x = 0.05 mol, leading to the same conclusion about the identities of salts A and B.)*\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite): NH₄NO₂**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 2\n    *   **Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate): NH₄NO₃**\n    *   Number of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 3\n    *   **Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
