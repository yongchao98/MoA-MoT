    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**1. Understanding Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups). Another important cause, relevant here, is axial chirality, which occurs in molecules like some substituted biphenyls (atropisomers) where rotation around a single bond is restricted. A chiral molecule will have an enantiomer, and a mixture of the two can rotate plane-polarized light.\n\n**2. Analysis of Each Compound**\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. Two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The key to chirality in biphenyls is restricted rotation (atropisomerism). This happens when there are bulky substituents in the ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho-positions are occupied by large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central C-C bond, locking the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This locked conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula can be written as `CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3`. This molecule is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Analysis:** We look for a chiral center. The carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group) is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms). It exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is `(C6H5)2CO`. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Analysis:** There are no chiral centers in benzophenone. The central carbon is `sp2` hybridized. While the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane, rotation around the C-phenyl bonds has a very low energy barrier. This means any chiral conformations rapidly interconvert at room temperature, resulting in a racemic mixture that cannot be separated. In practice, benzophenone is considered achiral because of this rapid conformational change. It does not have stable enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is considered achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`, specifically the *trans* isomer around the double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is planar. Planar molecules are almost always achiral because the plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Dimethyl fumarate also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate, but this is not optical isomerism).\n\n**3. Summary**\n\n*   Compound 1: **Shows** optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: **Shows** optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: **Does not show** optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: **Does not show** optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option C.\n\nTo verify this reasoning, a computational chemistry approach using Python and the RDKit library can be employed to identify chiral structures.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"RDKit is not installed.

Compounds 1 and 2 are identified as showing optical isomerism, while 3 and 4 are not.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Based on the chemical principles and verified by computational analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An analysis of each compound is required to determine which exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The key to its potential chirality lies in a phenomenon called **atropisomerism**. This occurs when rotation around a single bond (in this case, the bond connecting the two phenyl rings) is severely restricted by bulky groups in the ortho-positions (the positions adjacent to the bond).\n*   **Ortho-substituents:** In this molecule, all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with large groups: two methyl ester groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Restricted Rotation:** The steric hindrance caused by these four bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely. This locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Chirality:** Because the substituents within each ring are different (one -COOCH3 group and one -NO2 group), the locked molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. A molecule that has restricted rotation and lacks these symmetry elements is chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism. It can exist as two stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula `CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3`.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The most common source of chirality is a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group):\n    1.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    2.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    3.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and shows optical isomerism. It has two enantiomers, (R)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze benzophenone\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `C6H5-CO-C6H5`. Two phenyl rings are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is not planar due to steric repulsion between the phenyl rings, but rotation around the C-C bonds is rapid at room temperature. The time-averaged conformation possesses a C2 axis and two mirror planes. More simply, there is no chiral center, and the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image due to its internal symmetry and conformational flexibility.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze dimethyl fumarate\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration about the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar due to the `sp2` hybridization of the carbons in the double bond. Planar molecules possess a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and are therefore achiral. Dimethyl fumarate also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism. (It does show geometric isomerism, its *cis* isomer being dimethyl maleate, but this is a different type of isomerism).\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
