    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the experiments.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    The structure is `CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH3`, with the two propyl groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   mCPBA performs a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond to form an epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is planar and achiral, the mCPBA can attack from either face (top or bottom) with equal probability.\n    *   Attack on a trans-alkene produces a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Attack from the top and bottom faces will produce a pair of enantiomers: (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Therefore, the product of the first step is a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (aqueous acid, H₃O⁺).**\n    *   The epoxide ring is opened by nucleophilic attack of a water molecule in the presence of acid. This reaction proceeds via an `anti`-addition mechanism (the water molecule attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide's C-O bond).\n    *   This two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a method for `anti`-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n    *   A useful mnemonic for the stereochemical outcome of such reactions is **\"E-Anti-Meso\"**: `anti`-addition to an **(E)**-alkene results in a **meso** product (if the alkene is symmetrically substituted, as oct-4-ene is).\n    *   Let's confirm this by analyzing the opening of each enantiomer of the epoxide:\n        *   **(4R, 5R)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺:** Water can attack at C4 (inverting it to S, giving (4S, 5R)-diol) or at C5 (inverting it to S, giving (4R, 5S)-diol). The (4S, 5R) and (4R, 5S) configurations for octane-4,5-diol describe the same achiral meso compound.\n        *   **(4S, 5S)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺:** Similarly, attack at C4 gives (4R, 5S)-diol, and attack at C5 gives (4S, 5R)-diol. Both lead to the same meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral.\n    The two propyl groups are on the same side of the double bond.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   Syn-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene produces a cis-epoxide.\n    *   For (Z)-oct-4-ene, this results in cis-4,5-epoxyoctane. This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound, (4R, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Only one product is formed in this step: the meso-epoxide.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (aqueous acid, H₃O⁺).**\n    *   This is again an `anti`-dihydroxylation process.\n    *   The mnemonic here is **\"Z-Anti-Racemic\"**: `anti`-addition to a **(Z)**-alkene results in a **racemic** mixture.\n    *   Let's confirm by analyzing the ring opening of the meso-epoxide ((4R, 5S)-epoxyoctane):\n        *   **Attack at C4 (R-configuration):** The nucleophile (water) inverts the stereocenter from R to S. The configuration at C5 remains S. The product is **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   **Attack at C5 (S-configuration):** The nucleophile inverts the stereocenter from S to R. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   The two products, (4S, 5S) and (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the meso-epoxide is achiral, attack at either carbon is equally probable, leading to a 50:50 mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships:\n*   (4R, 5R)-diol and (4S, 5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R, 5R)-diol and the (4S, 5S)-diol.\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral chromatography separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and thus **cannot** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak. So, the (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) diols will form one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can** be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting racemic pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral chromatography uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers. The transient interactions between the enantiomers and the chiral stationary phase are diastereomeric and have different energies, leading to different retention times.\n    *   **Enantiomers** **can** be separated. The (4R, 5R)-diol and (4S, 5S)-diol will resolve into two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Diastereomers** can also be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from both of the chiral diols.\n    *   Assuming ideal resolution, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R, 5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S, 5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks in standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in chiral HPLC**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
