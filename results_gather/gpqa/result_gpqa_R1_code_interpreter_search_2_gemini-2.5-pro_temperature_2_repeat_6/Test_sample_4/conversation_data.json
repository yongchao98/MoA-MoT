    "To solve this problem, we need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ along a direction $\\vec{n}$ that lies in the x-z plane. This eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n\n**1. Define the Operators**\n\nThe components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ are given as:\n$P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n$P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n$P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\nThese are the spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle, where $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.\n\n**2. Define the Direction Vector**\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. We can describe this direction using a unit vector parameterized by a single angle $\\theta$, which we take as the polar angle with respect to the z-axis. In spherical coordinates, this corresponds to an azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. The Cartesian components of the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ are:\n$n_x = \\sin\\theta$\n$n_y = 0$\n$n_z = \\cos\\theta$\nSo, $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**3. Construct the Operator along $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_{\\vec{n}}$, is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the components:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, substitute the matrix forms of $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\nLet the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n**5. Solve for the Eigenvector Components**\n\nLet's solve the first equation to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n$1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n$\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $C$.\n\n**6. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nThe normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$, which means the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components is 1.\nLet's choose a convenient representation for the unnormalized eigenvector by multiplying by $\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = C' \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe normalization requirement is:\n$|C'|^2 (|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2) = 1$\nSince $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$, we get $|C'|^2 = 1$. We can choose the phase to be zero, so $C'=1$.\n\nThe normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**7. Compare with Options**\n\nLet's look at the given options:\nA) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect. Contains $\\hbar$ and incorrect normalization.\nB) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect. These are components of the direction vector, not the eigenvector, and the arguments are $\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$.\nC) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Correct. This matches our derived result.\nD) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect. Contains $\\hbar$ and is independent of $\\theta$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
