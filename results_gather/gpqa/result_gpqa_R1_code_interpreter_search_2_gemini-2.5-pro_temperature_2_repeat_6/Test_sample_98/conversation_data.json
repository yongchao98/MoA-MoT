    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help differentiate between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   \"No vinyl-hydrogens\": This means there are no protons attached to sp² hybridized carbons of a C=C double bond. None of the proposed structures have C=C double bonds, so this is consistent with all options.\n    *   \"A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\": This is a complex splitting pattern. For a proton to exhibit this multiplicity, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   `doublet (d)`: coupled to 1 neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n        *   `triplet (t)`: coupled to 2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n        *   `quartet (q)`: coupled to 3 equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, n+1=4).\n        *   So, we are looking for a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to another methine (`-CH-`), a methylene (`-CH₂-`), and a methyl (`-CH₃`) group.\n    *   \"A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\": Similarly, for this pattern, a proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   `doublet (d)`: coupled to 1 neighboring proton.\n        *   `triplet (t)`: coupled to 2 equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   `triplet (t)`: coupled to another, non-equivalent set of 2 equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   So, we are looking for a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to another methine (`-CH-`) and two different methylene (`-CH₂-`) groups.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n\n    Let's systematically analyze the structure of each option to see if its protons would produce the observed splitting patterns. The key is to find a single molecule that contains *both* a proton that gives a `dtq` and another that gives a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        ```\n                              CH₃(a)\n                              |\n                CH₃(f)-CH₂(e)-C³H(d)-C²H(c)-COOH\n                              |\n                              CH₃(b)\n        ```\n        *   `H(c)` at C² is coupled to `H(d)` (1H) and `CH₃(a)` (3H). This would be a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n        *   `H(d)` at C³ is coupled to `H(c)` (1H), `CH₃(b)` (3H), and `CH₂(e)` (2H). This gives a **`dqt`** (or `dtq`), which matches one of the signals.\n        *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a CH and two different CH₂ groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Option D is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        ```\n                    CH₃(b)  CH₃(e)\n                    |      |\n             H₃C(a)-C⁴H(c)--C³H(d)-CH₂(f)-COOH\n        ```\n        *   `H(d)` at C³ is coupled to `H(c)` (1H), `CH₃(e)` (3H), and `CH₂(f)` (2H). This gives a **`dqt`** (or `dtq`), matching one signal.\n        *   `H(c)` at C⁴ is coupled to `H(d)` (1H) and the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups `(a)` and `(b)` (isopropyl group). This would be a doublet of septets.\n        *   No proton can produce a `dtt` signal. Option C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n        Let's interpret the condensed formula. `(CH₃)(C₂H₅)CH-` is a sec-butyl group, `CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)-`. This is attached to `-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂COOH`. This gives the structure for 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid.\n        ```\n                             CH₃(g)\n                             |\n        CH₃(f)-CH₂(e)-C⁴H(d)-C³H(c)-C²H₂(h)-COOH\n                                  |\n                                  C(a)H₂-C(b)H₃ (ethyl group)\n        ```\n        *   Let's analyze the methine proton **`H(c)`** at C³. Its neighbors are on the adjacent carbons: C², C⁴, and C(a).\n            *   On C²: a `CH₂(h)` group (2 protons) → gives a triplet.\n            *   On C⁴: a `CH(d)` group (1 proton) → gives a doublet.\n            *   On C(a): a `CH₂(a)` group (2 protons) → gives a triplet.\n            *   Therefore, `H(c)` is a **`doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)`**. This perfectly matches one of the signals.\n        *   Now let's analyze the other methine proton **`H(d)`** at C⁴. Its neighbors are on the adjacent carbons: C³, C⁵, and the methyl carbon `(g)`.\n            *   On C³: a `CH(c)` group (1 proton) → gives a doublet.\n            *   On C⁵: a `CH₂(e)` group (2 protons) → gives a triplet.\n            *   On carbon `(g)`: a `CH₃(g)` group (3 protons) → gives a quartet.\n            *   Therefore, `H(d)` is a **`doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)`**. This perfectly matches the other signal.\n\n        Since this molecule accounts for both of the complex splitting patterns described, it is the correct structure.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        ```\n                    CH₂(b)-CH₃  CH₂(d)-CH₃\n                    |          |\n        CH₃-CH₂-C³H(c)----C²H(a)-COOH\n        ```\n        Let's assume the main chain is pentanoic acid.\n        ```\n                 Et(d)      Et(b)\n                 |          |\n        H₃C(f)-H₂C(e)-C³H(c)-C²H(a)-COOH\n        ```\n        *   `H(c)` at C³ is coupled to `H(a)` (1H), `CH₂(e)` (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group substituent (d) (2H). This would be a **`dtt`**.\n        *   However, no proton is adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, *and* a CH₃. Therefore, there can be no `dtq` signal. Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nOnly structure B, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, has protons that would give rise to both a `doublet of triplets of quartets` and a `doublet of triplets of triplets` in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
