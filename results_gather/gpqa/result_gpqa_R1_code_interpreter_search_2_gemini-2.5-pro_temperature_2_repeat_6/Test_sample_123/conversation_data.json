    "An ultra-relativistic particle's decay in the laboratory frame is governed by its proper lifetime `τ` and its Lorentz factor `γ`.

    "The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that travel a distance `R` before decaying is given by the formula:\nN/N₀ = e^(-t / τ_lab)\n\nHere, `t` is the time it takes to travel the distance `R` in the lab frame, so `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. Thus, `t ≈ R/c`.\n\n`τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame. Due to time dilation, this is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` by `τ_lab = γ * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get:\nN/N₀ = e^(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = e^(-R / (γ * c * τ))\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for a given particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `C`. So the equation simplifies to:\nN/N₀ = e^(-C / γ)\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   `γ₁ = 20`\n*   `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into our simplified equation:\n1/3 = e^(-C / 20)\n\nTo find the constant `C`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -C / 20\n-ln(3) = -C / 20\nC = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nUsing the same equation with our calculated constant `C`:\n2/3 = e^(-C / γ₂)\n2/3 = e^(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for `γ₂`:\nln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\nln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\nln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)\n\nUsing a calculator, `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\nγ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe code output confirms this calculation: `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`.
