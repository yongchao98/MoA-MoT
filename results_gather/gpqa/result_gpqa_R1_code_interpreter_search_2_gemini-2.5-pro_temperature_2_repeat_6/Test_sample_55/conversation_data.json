    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state (also known as the 3s state) to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground state) via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the E1 selection rules because the change in orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, would be $0-0=0$. The E1 selection rules are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n\n    The decay must proceed through an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The two steps are:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n    2.  $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    *   **First transition:** From $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (with $l=0, m=0$) to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, we must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, we must have $m' - 0 \\in \\{0, \\pm 1\\}$, so $m' \\in \\{0, \\pm 1\\}$.\n    *   **Second transition:** From $|n',l',m'\\rangle = |n',1,m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (with $l_f=0, m_f=0$).\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, we need $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is satisfied.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, we need $m_f - m' = 0 - m' \\in \\{0, \\pm 1\\}$. This is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($m' \\in \\{0, \\pm 1\\}$).\n    *   The options provided suggest the intermediate state has a principal quantum number $n'=2$. So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These are the three sub-states of the 2p orbital.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The problem asks for the probability of a specific route. This can be interpreted as a cascade process, where we need to find the branching ratio for each step. The overall probability of a specific route is the product of the branching ratios of the sequential steps.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Probability of $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0, m=0$) and unpolarized. The transition rate to a specific final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, summed over all possible photon polarizations and emission directions. This rate, let's call it $W(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$, is given by:\n        $W \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m'|\\mathbf{r}|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,m'|x|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m'|y|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m'|z|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$\n\n        Due to the rotational symmetry of the problem (decay from an $l=0$ state in empty space), the probabilities of transitioning to any of the available magnetic sublevels of the final state must be equal. Therefore, the transition rates to $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are identical.\n        Let $W_1 = W(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,1) = W(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = W(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,-1)$.\n        The total transition rate to the $2p$ level is $W_{total} = 3W_1$.\n        The branching ratio for transitioning to any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n        $Br(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{W_1}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_1}{3W_1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Probability of $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        Now consider the decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. This state will decay to a lower energy state following the E1 selection rules. The only available lower energy state satisfying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. (Decay to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ would involve $\\Delta n=0$, which is possible but much less probable, and it would not lead to the specified final state).\n        Therefore, assuming the atom decays from the $2p$ level, it will certainly go to the $1s$ level. The branching ratio is 1.\n        $Br(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for all $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Overall Probability for Each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios of its steps.\n\n    *   **Route A:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        Probability = $Br(3s \\to 2p_{m=1}) \\times Br(2p_{m=1} \\to 1s) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Route B/C:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        Probability = $Br(3s \\to 2p_{m=0}) \\times Br(2p_{m=0} \\to 1s) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Route D:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        Probability = $Br(3s \\to 2p_{m=-1}) \\times Br(2p_{m=-1} \\to 1s) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    We have found that all three possible routes through the $n=2$ intermediate states are equally probable, each with a probability of $1/3$. Now we check the given options:\n\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (The probability is incorrect)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (The route is valid and the probability is correct)\n    C) $\\dots\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (The probability is incorrect)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (The probability is incorrect)\n\n    The only option that presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability is option B.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n<<<B>>>"
