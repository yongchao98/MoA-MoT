    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles.\n    *   **Identical Particles:** They are indistinguishable from one another.\n    *   **Spin-1/2:** These particles are fermions.\n    *   **Fermion Property:** Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n2.  **Define the Quantum States:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n    *   The quantum state of a particle is defined by its principal quantum number *n* (which determines the energy level) and its spin projection *m_s* (spin up or spin down).\n    *   The energy of a single particle in the *n*-th level is given by the formula:\n        E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n    *   The problem defines a unit of energy E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2).\n    *   Therefore, the energy of a particle in the *n*-th level can be simplified to E_n = n^2 * E.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle in this context:** For each energy level *n*, there are two possible spin states (spin up, ↑, and spin down, ↓). This means each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs):**\n    The ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   **Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1² * E = 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   **Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2² * E = 4E):** We have two particles left. We place them in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** Sum the energies of all four particles.\n        E_gs = (2 particles × E₁) + (2 particles × E₂)\n        E_gs = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n    *   **Highest occupied level in ground state:** n=2.\n    *   **Lowest unoccupied level:** n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3² * E = 9E).\n    *   **Promotion:** Move one particle from level n=2 to level n=3.\n    *   **New configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n        E_1st = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must find the configuration with a total energy just above the first excited state (15E). Let's list the possible low-energy configurations and their total energies:\n    *   **Configuration A (First Excitation):** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3 (from the ground state).\n        *   Occupation: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n        *   Energy: (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n    *   **Configuration B (Second Excitation):** Move the second particle from n=2 to n=3 (promoting from the ground state).\n        *   Occupation: 2 particles in n=1, 0 particles in n=2, 2 particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy: (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n    *   **Configuration C (Third Excitation):** Promote the particle from the first excited state's n=3 level to n=4.\n        *   Occupation: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 0 in n=3, 1 in n=4 (Energy E₄ = 4²E = 16E).\n        *   Energy: (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   Comparing the energies (18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** E_2nd = 18E.\n\n6.  **Summary and Final Answer:**\n    *   Ground state energy = 10E\n    *   First excited state energy = 15E\n    *   Second excited state energy = 18E\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
