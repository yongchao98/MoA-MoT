    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the initial state.**\n    We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero. It has a spherical cavity inside, which is off-center.\n\n*   **Step 2: Placing a charge inside the cavity.**\n    A positive charge, +q, is placed somewhere inside the cavity. This is our source charge.\n\n*   **Step 3: Charge Induction on the Inner Surface.**\n    According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. Let's consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. Since the electric field on this Gaussian surface is zero, the total electric flux through it is zero. By Gauss's Law ($\\Phi_E = Q_{enc}/\\epsilon_o$), this implies that the total charge enclosed ($Q_{enc}$) by the Gaussian surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge +q placed inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner wall of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    Therefore, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$.\n    A charge of -q is induced on the inner surface of the spherical cavity.\n\n*   **Step 4: Charge Induction on the Outer Surface.**\n    The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0). Since a charge of -q has been induced on its inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality, a charge of +q must be induced on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    Total charge = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$ (for the initially uncharged conductor).\n    So, $(-q) + q_{outer} = 0$, which means $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n*   **Step 5: Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface and Electrostatic Shielding.**\n    A fundamental property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The conducting material shields the region outside from the electric fields created by charges inside it. The arrangement of the charge +q and the induced charge -q within the cavity has no effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n    The electric field outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge distribution on its outer surface. We have a charge of +q on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius R. Since there are no other external charges in the problem, this +q charge will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to minimize repulsion and achieve an equipotential surface.\n\n*   **Step 6: Calculating the Electric Field Outside the Conductor.**\n    According to the shell theorem (which is a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the electric field of a single point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n    In our case, we have a total charge of +q distributed uniformly on the outer sphere of radius R. The point P is located at a distance L from the center of this sphere.\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor.\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\n*   **Step 7: Evaluating the options.**\n    The variables r, s, l, and $\\theta$ describe the geometry of the cavity and the relative position of P with respect to the cavity. Due to electrostatic shielding, these details are irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor. The only relevant parameters are the total charge on the outer surface (+q) and the distance from the center of the conductor to the point P (L).\n\n    A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This ignores the conductor and uses the distance from the cavity center.\n    B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. This is a complex distance formula, not applicable here.\n    C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Another complex distance formula.\n    D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct. This correctly represents the field outside a spherical conductor with a net charge +q on its surface.\n\n<<<D>>>"
