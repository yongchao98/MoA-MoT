    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   **Reactant:** Butan-2-one is a ketone (CH₃COCH₂CH₃). It has a carbonyl group (C=O) which is electrophilic at the carbon atom.\n    *   **Reagent:** NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin. It's formed by adding an -H and a -CN group across the C=O double bond of the ketone.\n    *   **Mechanism (Cyanohydrin Formation):**\n        1.  The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  The pi bond of the carbonyl group breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. `H₃O⁺` represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., HCl in water), which is a standard proton source for this type of workup step. `NaHSO₃` is sodium bisulfite; it reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction pathway. Therefore, A must be `H₃O⁺`.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Transformation:** The key change is the conversion of the nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism (Nitrile Hydrolysis):** This conversion is a hydrolysis reaction. Hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be achieved under either strongly acidic or strongly basic conditions, usually with heating. The reaction is shown as occurring in the presence of `B` and `H₂O`. This suggests an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. The reaction requires a strong acid to protonate the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B:**\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid and is a very common and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to catalyze this hydrolysis reaction to completion efficiently.\n    *   Therefore, B must be `HCl`.\n\n3.  **Combine the findings and select the correct option:**\n    *   From step 1, we determined that **A = H₃O⁺**.\n    *   From step 2, we determined that **B = HCl**.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect B)\n        *   B) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl (Correct A and Correct B)\n        *   C) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl (Incorrect A)\n        *   D) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect A and Incorrect B)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
