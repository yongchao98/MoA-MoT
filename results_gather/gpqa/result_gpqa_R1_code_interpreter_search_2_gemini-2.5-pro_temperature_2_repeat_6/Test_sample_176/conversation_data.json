    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2 (L_1 / L_2).\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Law:** The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity (L) of a spherical black body is determined by its surface area and temperature according to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    L = A * σ * T⁴\n    where:\n    *   L = Luminosity\n    *   A = Surface Area = 4 * π * R² (where R is the radius)\n    *   σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n    *   T = Surface temperature\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the luminosity for each star and then find their ratio:\n    *   L_1 = 4 * π * R_1² * σ * T_1⁴\n    *   L_2 = 4 * π * R_2² * σ * T_2⁴\n\n    Dividing L_1 by L_2:\n    L_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1² * σ * T_1⁴) / (4 * π * R_2² * σ * T_2⁴)\n\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)² * (T_1 / T_2)⁴\n\n4.  **Extract and Analyze Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius:** Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. This means R_1 = 1.5 * R_2, or (R_1 / R_2) = 1.5.\n    *   **Peak Wavelength:** The stars have the same peak wavelength (λ_max). This piece of information relates to the temperature of the stars via Wien's Displacement Law (λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant). If λ_max1 = λ_max2, then it must be that T_1 = T_2. Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures (T_1 / T_2) = 1.\n    *   **Mass:** The mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. While mass and luminosity are related (the mass-luminosity relation), the problem specifies to assume black body radiation, for which the Stefan-Boltzmann law is the direct formula. This information is extraneous.\n    *   **Radial Velocity:** The radial velocities are given as 0 km/s and 700 km/s. Radial velocity causes a Doppler shift in the observed spectrum, but it does not change the star's intrinsic luminosity (its total energy output). Therefore, this information is also extraneous to the question asked.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the derived ratios for radius and temperature into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    *   L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n    *   L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * 1\n    *   L_1 / L_2 = 2.25\n\nTo confirm the simple calculation, let's use the code interpreter.\n```python\n# The ratio of luminosities L1/L2 is given by (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# From the problem statement, the ratio of radii R1/R2 is 1.5.\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\n\n# Since the peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures are the same.\n# So, the ratio of temperatures T1/T2 is 1.\nT1_over_T2 = 1.0\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (T1_over_T2)**4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.25\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** The calculated factor is 2.25. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The luminosity of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL = A * σ * T^4\nwhere L is the luminosity, A is the surface area (4 * π * R^2 for a spherical star), σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L_1) to that of Star_2 (L_2):\nL_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4) / (4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\nL_1 / L_2 = (R_1^2 / R_2^2) * (T_1^4 / T_2^4)\nL_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4\n\nNow, let's use the information given in the problem to find the ratios of the radii and temperatures.\n\n1.  **Ratio of Radii (R_1 / R_2):**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    R_1 = 1.5 * R_2\n    So, R_1 / R_2 = 1.5\n\n2.  **Ratio of Temperatures (T_1 / T_2):**\n    The relationship between the temperature of a black body and the wavelength at which it appears brightest (λ_max) is given by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    λ_max = b / T\n    where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    The problem states that the stars have the same peak wavelength (λ_max,1 = λ_max,2).\n    This implies that their surface temperatures must also be the same (T_1 = T_2).\n    Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures, T_1 / T_2, is 1.\n\nThe information about the masses and radial velocities is extraneous to this calculation, as luminosity in the black body model depends only on radius and temperature.\n\nNow, we can substitute these ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation:\nL_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (1)^4\nL_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * 1\nL_1 / L_2 = 2.25\n\nSo, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. This corresponds to option D.\nI will use the provided code interpreter to confirm this calculation.\n```python\n# The ratio of luminosities L1/L2 is given by the formula (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.\n# We are given that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star 2.\nratio_of_radii = 1.5\n\n# We are given that the peak emission wavelengths are the same for both stars.\n# According to Wien's Displacement Law (lambda_max = b/T), if the peak wavelengths are the same,\n# the temperatures must also be the same.\nratio_of_temperatures = 1.0\n\n# Calculate the ratio of luminosities.\nratio_of_luminosities = (ratio_of_radii)**2 * (ratio_of_temperatures)**4\n\nprint(ratio_of_luminosities)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.25\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms the result of 2.25. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
