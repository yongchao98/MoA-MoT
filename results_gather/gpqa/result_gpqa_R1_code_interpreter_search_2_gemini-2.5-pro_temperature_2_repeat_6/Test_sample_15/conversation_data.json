    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such molecules are called meso compounds). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   There are no stereocenters (sp3 carbons with four different substituents) in this molecule. C1 and C2 are sp2 hybridized carbons of the double bond. C3 and C4 are in the ethyl group, and the methyl carbon is not chiral.\n    *   The molecule is essentially planar around the double bond. This planarity acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself specifies a single, well-defined stereoisomer using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notation for stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and E/Z notation for the double bond (E).\n    *   The presence of R/S descriptors at positions 3a and 7a, which are not symmetrically equivalent, indicates that the molecule is chiral. A specific enantiomer like this is, by definition, optically active. It is not a meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). This symmetry means that a meso form is possible.\n    *   The (2R, 3S) diastereomer has stereocenters with opposite configurations. In a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the (R,S) form is the meso isomer. It possesses a center of inversion in its staggered conformation and a plane of symmetry in its eclipsed conformation.\n    *   Being a meso compound, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) isomer is an enantiomer. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, indicating that the molecule is chiral.\n    *   Let's verify the chiral center. C1, which bears the hydroxyl group, is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These four groups are indeed different.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this specific enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This notation describes the cis,cis-1,3,5-triol isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (e.g., all axial or all equatorial).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**. In fact, all stereoisomers of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol are achiral.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a ketone where the carbonyl group (`C=O`) is C1 of a butan-1-one chain, with a methyl group on C3 and a cyclopentyl group on C1. This corresponds to the structure `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` (also known as isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone).\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring is attached to the carbonyl group at a carbon which is not a stereocenter, as the paths around the ring are identical.\n        *   In the `(CH3)2CH-CH2-CO-` chain (3-methylbutanoyl group), the carbon `CH` is bonded to a `H`, a `CH2` group, and two identical `CH3` groups. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and lacks any other form of chirality. It has a plane of symmetry in a certain conformation.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   Compound 1: Inactive\n*   Compound 2: **Active**\n*   Compound 3: Inactive\n*   Compound 4: **Active**\n*   Compound 5: **Active**\n*   Compound 6: Inactive\n*   Compound 7: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<B>>>"
