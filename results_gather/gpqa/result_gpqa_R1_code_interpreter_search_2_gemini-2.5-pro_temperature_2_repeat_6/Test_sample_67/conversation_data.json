    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   A spin-1/2 particle has a spin angular momentum vector `S = (Sx, Sy, Sz)`. Its magnetic moment is a vector `μ` proportional to its spin, `μ = γS`, where `γ` (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μ_z = γSz`.\n*   Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field `B = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `H = -μ ⋅ B`.\n*   So, the initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ_z * B = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The particle's moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in an energy eigenstate. The energy eigenstates of `H_initial` are the same as the eigenstates of `Sz`: spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>`.\n*   \"Aligned\" implies the magnetic moment `μ_z` has a positive projection on the Z-axis, making the energy `E = -μ_z * B` as low as possible. This means the particle is in the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to `B' = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is `H' = -μ ⋅ B' = -μ_y * B = -γB * Sy`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H'`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = exp(-i * H' * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n*   Substituting `H'` and `|ψ(0)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γB * Sy) * t / ħ) |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γB * t * Sy / ħ) |+z>`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value `<μz(t)>`\n\n*   We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)>`.\n*   `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γSz |ψ(t)> = γ * <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n*   To calculate this, we need to evaluate how the state `|ψ(t)>` evolves. We can do this in several ways.\n\n#### Method 1: Heisenberg Picture\n\nThis is often the most direct way to find the oscillation frequency. In the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time. The equation of motion for an operator `A` is `dA/dt = (i/ħ)[H', A]`.\n\n1.  Find the equation for `Sz(t)`:\n    `d(Sz)/dt = (i/ħ)[H', Sz] = (i/ħ)[-γB*Sy, Sz] = (-iγB/ħ)[Sy, Sz]`\n    Using the spin commutation relation `[Sy, Sz] = iħSx`:\n    `d(Sz)/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(iħSx) = γB * Sx(t)`\n\n2.  Find the equation for `Sx(t)`:\n    `d(Sx)/dt = (i/ħ)[H', Sx] = (i/ħ)[-γB*Sy, Sx] = (-iγB/ħ)[Sy, Sx]`\n    Using the spin commutation relation `[Sx, Sy] = iħSz`, which implies `[Sy, Sx] = -iħSz`:\n    `d(Sx)/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(-iħSz) = -γB * Sz(t)`\n\n3.  We have a system of two coupled differential equations for the expectation values:\n    a) `d<Sz>/dt = γB * <Sx>`\n    b) `d<Sx>/dt = -γB * <Sz>`\n\n4.  Differentiate equation (a) with respect to `t`:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = γB * d<Sx>/dt`\n    Substitute equation (b) into this:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = γB * (-γB * <Sz>) = -(γB)² * <Sz>`\n\n5.  This is the classic equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -Ω²x`. By comparing the two equations, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `Ω`.\n    `Ω² = (γB)²` => `Ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Schrödinger Picture (Energy Eigenstates)\n\nAnother way is to look at the energy levels of the new system. Oscillations in a two-level system occur at a frequency corresponding to the energy difference between the levels.\n\n1.  The new Hamiltonian is `H' = -γB * Sy`. The energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which we can call `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n2.  The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n3.  The energy eigenvalues of `H'` are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of Sy)`.\n    `E_+y = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n    `E_-y = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n4.  The initial state `|+z>` is not an energy eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. It is a superposition of `|+y>` and `|-y>`. Specifically, `|+z> = (1/√2)|+y> + (1/√2)|-y>`.\n5.  The system will oscillate between these two energy states. The angular frequency of this oscillation is given by the energy difference `ΔE` between the states:\n    `Ω = ΔE / ħ`\n6.  `ΔE = E_-y - E_+y = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`\n7.  `Ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nBoth methods show that the expectation value of `Sz` oscillates with an angular frequency `Ω = γB`.\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ * <Sz(t)>`. Since `γ` is just a constant factor, `<μ_z(t)>` oscillates with the exact same frequency as `<Sz(t)>`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and `Ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency. The spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field (along the Y-axis) at this frequency. Its projection on the Z-axis therefore oscillates with this frequency.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe calculated oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
