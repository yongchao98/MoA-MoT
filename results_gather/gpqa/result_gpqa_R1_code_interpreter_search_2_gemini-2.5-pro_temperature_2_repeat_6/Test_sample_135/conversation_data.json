    "This problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field within a sphere of radius R. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and is directed radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, this vector field can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction. The field has no components in the `θ` or `φ` directions (`f_θ = 0`, `f_φ = 0`).\n\n**2. The Integral to Evaluate**\n\nWe need to compute the volume integral of the divergence of `f` over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin:\n`I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\n\n**3. Applying the Divergence Theorem**\n\nDirectly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` gives:\nIn spherical coordinates, the divergence is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r)`\nSubstituting `f_r = 1/r^2`:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1) = 0`\n\nThis result `∇ ⋅ f = 0` is valid for all points where `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f(r)` is infinite, creating a singularity. The divergence is undefined at this single point.\n\nA more robust way to solve this integral, especially with a singularity at the origin, is to use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and the surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\n**4. Calculating the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n\n*   **The vector field on the surface S:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n*   **The differential surface area element dS:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is a vector pointing radially outward:\n    `dS = (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r_hat`\n*   **The dot product (f ⋅ dS):** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ`\n*   **The surface integral:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for `θ` are from `0` to `π`, and for `φ` are from `0` to `2π`:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] ∫[from θ=0 to π] sinθ dθ dφ`\n\nLet's evaluate the integral in two parts:\n1.  The integral with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫[from θ=0 to π] sinθ dθ = [-cosθ][from 0 to π] = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n2.  The integral with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫[from φ=0 to 2π] dφ = [φ][from 0 to 2π] = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n\nMultiplying the results of the two integrals gives the total flux:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2) * (2π) = 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of `f` is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThe result is `4π`, which corresponds to option C. This is a classic result from electrostatics, representing Gauss's Law for a point charge at the origin (in appropriate units).\n\n<<<C>>>"
