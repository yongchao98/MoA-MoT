    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus (a common gut pathogen).\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, mimicking a natural route of infection for gut pathogens.\n    *   **Location:** The immune response is observed in Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, responsible for initiating adaptive immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n    *   **Cell population:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. In a secondary lymphoid organ, following antigen presentation, B cells and T cells proliferate. The focus on the heavy chain gene points specifically to B cells. This proliferation of antigen-specific B cells occurs in a structure called a germinal center.\n    *   **Key finding:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" shows \"high variability\". This is the most critical piece of information. The variable region of an antibody is what binds to the antigen.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the immunological processes listed in the options.**\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region (Fc portion) of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA). This alters the antibody's effector function (e.g., where it's secreted or how it interacts with other immune cells) but does *not* affect the variable region, which determines antigen binding. Therefore, this process does not account for the high variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that takes place in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM deliberately introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable region genes (both heavy and light chains). The purpose of this is to generate a pool of B cells with slightly different antibodies. B cells with mutations that increase their affinity for the antigen are then positively selected to survive and proliferate, a process called affinity maturation. The observation of \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population after antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system. It's a cascade of plasma proteins that can be activated by pathogens or antibodies, leading to inflammation, opsonization (tagging for phagocytosis), and direct killing of pathogens. It does not involve any genetic changes in B cells.\n    *   **D) VDJ recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that occurs in developing B cells (and T cells) in the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells). It randomly assembles Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) gene segments to create the initial, vast repertoire of antigen receptors *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. While it generates diversity, it is not the process occurring in a *proliferating* population in a *secondary* lymphoid organ in response to an antigen challenge. The variability described in the question is being generated *during* the immune response, not before it.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude based on the evidence.**\n    The scenario describes an ongoing adaptive immune response in a gut-associated secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) triggered by a specific antigen (rotavirus protein). The finding of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation, the process that refines antibody affinity during a germinal center reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
