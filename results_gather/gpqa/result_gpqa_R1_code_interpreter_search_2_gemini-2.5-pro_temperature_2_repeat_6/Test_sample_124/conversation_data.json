    "Answering the user's question requires understanding the quantum mechanical model of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, this is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This potential describes a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning it can be treated as three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n    For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    We can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$.\n    The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are indexed by the quantum number $n$.\n    *   Ground State: $n = 0$, $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   First Excited State: $n = 1$, $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   Second Excited State: $n = 2$, $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State**: $n = 3$, $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. We need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n\n    Let's list the possible combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — This gives 3 states.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, another is 1, and the last is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — This gives 6 states (all permutations of 2, 1, 0).\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1) — This gives 1 state.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, there is a general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the $n$-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n    So, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n    A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10  (Incorrect energy)\n    B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3   (Incorrect energy and degeneracy)\n    C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3            (Incorrect degeneracy)\n    D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10           (Correct energy and degeneracy)\n\n<<<D>>>"
