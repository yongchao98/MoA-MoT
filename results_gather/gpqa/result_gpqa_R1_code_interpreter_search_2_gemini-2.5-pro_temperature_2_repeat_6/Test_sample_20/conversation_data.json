    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n    *   Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two or more interconvertible constitutional isomers, usually involving the migration of a proton. Keto-enol tautomerism is the most common type, where a molecule containing a carbonyl group (keto form) is in equilibrium with its enol form (a molecule containing a C=C double bond and a hydroxyl group). A prerequisite for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds. Let's examine the carbons alpha to the carbonyl groups. These are the carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. All of these carbons are part of C=C double bonds and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these alpha-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens are highly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. The molecule can easily lose a proton from these alpha-carbons to form an enolate, which can then be protonated on the oxygen to form an enol. In fact, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists predominantly in its tri-enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and therefore very stable compound. Thus, it exhibits extensive tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n    *   Optical isomerism (a form of stereoisomerism) is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is attached to the hydroxyl group. This carbon is bonded to:\n        *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism (it has a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a trans geometry about the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains all the atoms except for the hydrogens of the methyl groups. It also possesses a center of inversion. A molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
