    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (Te) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    Te = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `a` is the orbital distance (semi-major axis).\n\n    In this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. We are also told that the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the term `T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / 2)` is a constant for the entire system.\n\n    This simplifies the relationship to:\n    Te ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n\n2.  **Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the orbital distances.**\n    From the relationship Te ∝ 1 / sqrt(a), we can write the ratio of temperatures for any two planets (e.g., Planet X and Planet Y) as:\n    Tx / Ty = sqrt(ay / ax)\n    This can be rearranged to find the ratio of their orbital distances:\n    ax / ay = (Ty / Tx)²\n\n    We are given:\n    *   T1 / T2 = 1.4\n    *   T2 / T3 = 2.3\n\n    Let's find the ratio of the orbital distances:\n    *   For Planet1 and Planet2: a2 / a1 = (T1 / T2)² = 1.4² = 1.96\n    *   For Planet2 and Planet3: a3 / a2 = (T2 / T3)² = 2.3² = 5.29\n\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (a3 / a1), we can multiply the two ratios we just found:\n    a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This implies:\n    P ∝ a^(3/2)\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 is:\n    P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n\n4.  **Calculate the final value.**\n    Using the value of a3 / a1 that we calculated in step 2:\n    P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n    P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^1.5\n\n    Let's perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given temperature ratios\nT1_div_T2 = 1.4\nT2_div_T3 = 2.3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a)\n# a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2\na2_div_a1 = T1_div_T2**2\n\n# a3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2\na3_div_a2 = T2_div_T3**2\n\n# Calculate the overall ratio a3/a1\na3_div_a1 = a3_div_a2 * a2_div_a1\n\n# Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of orbital periods (P)\n# P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)\nP3_div_P1 = a3_div_a1**1.5\n\nprint(f\"{P3_div_P1=}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nP3_div_P1=33.38600185449755\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.386 times larger than that of Planet1. This value rounds to 33.4.\n\nThe information regarding the planet masses and the TTV method is not required for this calculation, as the mass of planets is typically negligible compared to the mass of their host star, and this standard assumption makes Kepler's Third Law applicable in its simpler form.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 4.4\nD) ~ 3.2\n\nOur calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature Te of an exoplanet is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis *a*) by the formula:\n\nTe ∝ (1/a)^1/2\n\nThis means that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (e.g., Planet X and Planet Y) orbiting the same star is:\n\nT_x / T_y = (a_y / a_x)^1/2\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the ratio of their orbital distances:\n\na_x / a_y = (T_y / T_x)^2\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T1 / T2 = 1.4\n*   T2 / T3 = 2.3\n\nNow we can calculate the ratios of the orbital distances:\n1.  Ratio of a2 to a1:\n    a2 / a1 = (T1 / T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96\n\n2.  Ratio of a3 to a2:\n    a3 / a2 = (T2 / T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (a3/a1), we multiply the individual ratios:\na3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n\nP^2 ∝ a^3  or  P ∝ a^(3/2)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 is:\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n\nNow we substitute the value of a3/a1 we calculated:\nP3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information about the planets' mass ratios and the specific albedo value (as long as it's the same for all planets) is not needed for this particular calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 4.4\nD) ~ 3.2\n\nOur calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
