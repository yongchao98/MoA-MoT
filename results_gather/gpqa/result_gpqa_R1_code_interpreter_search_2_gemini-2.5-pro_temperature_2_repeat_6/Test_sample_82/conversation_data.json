    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the initial conditions and dilution:**\n*   **Initial Acid:** We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   **New Volume:** The total volume of the acetic acid solution becomes 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   **New Concentration:** We calculate the new concentration of the acid using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n    *   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n    *   So, we are titrating a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Titration Reaction:**\nThe titration involves the reaction between a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH):\nCH₃COOH (aq) + NaOH (aq) → CH₃COONa (aq) + H₂O (l)\n\n**3. pH at 25% Titration:**\n*   **Definition:** 25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). At this point, 75% of the original acetic acid remains.\n*   **Buffer System:** The solution now contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻ from CH₃COONa). This is a buffer solution.\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKₐ + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    Where:\n    *   pKₐ = -log(Kₐ)\n    *   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   First, calculate pKₐ:\n        pKₐ = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 4.7328\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles of conjugate base to the moles of acid is 25/75 = 1/3. Since they are in the same volume, the concentration ratio is also 1/3.\n    *   Now, plug the values into the equation:\n        pH = 4.7328 + log(25 / 75)\n        pH = 4.7328 + log(1/3)\n        pH = 4.7328 - log(3)\n        pH = 4.7328 - 0.4771\n        pH ≈ 4.26\n\n**4. pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n*   **Definition:** The equivalence point is reached when the moles of added NaOH are exactly equal to the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n*   **Reaction Completion:** At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution only contains CH₃COONa and water.\n*   **Hydrolysis:** The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will react with water (hydrolyze) to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₂O (l) ⇌ CH₃COOH (aq) + OH⁻ (aq)\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   **Step a: Moles of acid and volume of NaOH:**\n        Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n        At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol.\n        Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   **Step b: Concentration of Acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n        Total volume at equivalence point = Volume of acid + Volume of base = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n        Concentration of CH₃COONa = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   **Step c: Calculate K₋b:**\n        Kₐ × K₋b = K₋w (where K₋w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C)\n        K₋b = K₋w / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   **Step d: Calculate [OH⁻] from hydrolysis:**\n        K₋b = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n        5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n        Since K₋b is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n        5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n        x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) = 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   **Step e: Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n        pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.483\n        pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.52\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\nTo confirm, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\n\n# -- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration --\n# Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# -- Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point --\n# 1.

    "The step-by-step thinking process and calculations are as follows:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Volume of water added: 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume of the diluted solution (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, we find the new concentration (M₂) of the acetic acid to be titrated:\n    M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the original acid remains.\n*   The solution contains a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, which constitutes a buffer solution. The pH of this buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKₐ + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, we need to calculate the pKₐ of acetic acid:\n    pKₐ = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid, [A⁻]/[HA], is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n    So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   The solution now consists of the conjugate base (acetate ion, CH₃COO⁻) in water. The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₂O (l) ⇌ CH₃COOH (aq) + OH⁻ (aq)\n*   **Step a:** Calculate the moles of acid initially present.\n    Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume (in L) = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Step b:** Calculate the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n    Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Step c:** Calculate the total volume and the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n    Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (acid) + 10.00 cm³ (base) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   **Step d:** Calculate the concentration of OH⁻ from the hydrolysis of acetate.\n    We need the base dissociation constant, K₋b. K₋b = K₋w / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    Using the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: K₋b = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻]. Then 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02.\n    Solving for x: x = [OH⁻] = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Step e:** Calculate pOH and then pH.\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\n**Summary of results:**\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at the equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nComparing these results with the given options, the correct answer is D.\n\nThe code execution confirmed these calculations.\n\n<<<D>>>"
