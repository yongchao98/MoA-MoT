    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to find two quantities for a system of two astronauts: their relative speed and the total energy of the system.\n\n    *   **Astronaut 1:**\n        *   Rest mass: `m₁ = 2m`\n        *   Velocity in a stationary frame (S): `v₁ = 0.6c` (in the positive x-direction)\n    *   **Astronaut 2:**\n        *   Rest mass: `m₂ = 3m`\n        *   Velocity in a stationary frame (S): `v₂ = 0.5c` (in the positive x-direction)\n    *   **Goals:**\n        1.  Calculate the relative speed `v_rel` between the two astronauts.\n        2.  Calculate the total energy `E_total` of the two-astronaut system in the stationary frame S.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel):**\n    *   Since the speeds are relativistic, I cannot simply subtract them (`0.6c - 0.5c`). I must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula.\n    *   The formula for relative velocity `u'` in a frame S' moving at velocity `v` with respect to frame S, for an object moving at velocity `u` in frame S, is:\n        `u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/c²) `\n    *   Let's find the velocity of Astronaut 1 (`u = v₁ = 0.6c`) as seen from the rest frame of Astronaut 2 (so, `v = v₂ = 0.5c`).\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) `\n        `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) `\n        `v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 `\n        `v_rel = (1/7)c `\n    *   Now, I convert the fraction to a decimal: `1 / 7 ≈ 0.1428...`\n    *   So, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E_total):**\n    *   The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts, as measured in the stationary frame S.\n        `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n    *   The formula for the total energy of a single relativistic particle is:\n        `E = γmc²`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Calculate E₁ for Astronaut 1:**\n        *   `m₁ = 2m`, `v₁ = 0.6c`\n        *   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ₁`:\n            `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n        *   Now, calculate `E₁`:\n            `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n    *   **Calculate E₂ for Astronaut 2:**\n        *   `m₂ = 3m`, `v₂ = 0.5c`\n        *   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ₂`:\n            `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n        *   Now, calculate `E₂`:\n            `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n    *   **Calculate Total Energy E_total:**\n        *   `E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`\n        *   So, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\n4.  **Verify with Code:** To ensure precision and avoid manual calculation errors, I'll quickly verify these results using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define variables\nm1_factor = 2.0\nv1 = 0.6  # in units of c\nm2_factor = 3.0\nv2 = 0.5  # in units of c\n\n# 1.

    "This problem requires two calculations based on the principles of special relativity: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (`v_rel`)\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we cannot simply subtract their velocities. We must use the relativistic velocity addition formula (specifically, the velocity subtraction form). Let the laboratory frame be S. The velocity of Astronaut 1 is `v₁ = 0.6c` and the velocity of Astronaut 2 is `v₂ = 0.5c`.\n\nWe want to find the velocity of Astronaut 1 as seen from Astronaut 2's reference frame. The formula is:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.142857 c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `v_rel = 0.14c`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of each astronaut, measured in the laboratory frame. The total energy (E) of a particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 (E₁):**\n*   Mass `m₁ = 2m`\n*   Velocity `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, γ₁:\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Now, calculate the energy E₁:\n    E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 (E₂):**\n*   Mass `m₂ = 3m`\n*   Velocity `v₂ = 0.5c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Now, calculate the energy E₂:\n    E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total Energy (E):**\n*   The total energy of the system is the sum of E₁ and E₂:\n    E = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `E = 5.96 mc²`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nThese values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
