    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The fundamental principle we'll use is the conservation of energy. In this particle annihilation process, the total energy of the initial particles (proton and antiproton) must be equal to the total energy of the final particles (four A particles).\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial energy ($E_{initial}$).**\n    The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible. In the center-of-mass frame of the collision, both the proton and the antiproton can be considered effectively at rest. Therefore, the initial energy is dominated by their rest mass energies.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV.\n    *   The antiproton has the same rest mass as the proton.\n    *   $E_{initial} = (\\text{rest mass energy of proton}) + (\\text{rest mass energy of antiproton})$\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n3.  **Set up the final energy ($E_{final}$).**\n    The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of each A particle is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   When these particles are created from the annihilation, they will be moving at high velocity and thus have significant kinetic energy. The total energy of a single moving particle is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Since there are four identical particles produced, we can assume they share the energy equally. The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Apply energy conservation to find the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).**\n    Now, we equate the initial and final energies:\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n5.  **Calculate the velocity (v) from the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).**\n    The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the equation:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    We can rearrange this to solve for $v/c$:\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    Now, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n    *   $v/c \\approx 0.7687$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated velocity is approximately 0.769c.\n    The options are:\n    A) 0.91c\n    B) 0.96c\n    C) 0.86c\n    D) 0.77c\n    Our calculated value is closest to 0.77c.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Using a standard value for proton rest mass energy in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\n\n# Given rest mass energy for particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# The initial system is a proton and an antiproton, assumed to be at rest.\n# Total initial energy is their combined rest mass energy.\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# The final system consists of four particles of type A.\n# The total final energy is 4 times the energy of a single A particle.\n# E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n\n# We can solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma.\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# The velocity v (as a fraction of c, i.e., beta = v/c) is related to gamma by:\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# Rearranging for beta: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A as a fraction of the speed of light (v/c) is: {beta:.4f}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Based on the reasoning process and the verified calculation, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.7688c. This value is closest to option D.\n\nThe detailed breakdown of the solution is as follows:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy of the system is conserved. The initial energy is the rest energy of the proton and the antiproton, as the antiproton is considered to be moving slowly (negligible kinetic energy). The final energy is the total relativistic energy of the four A particles created.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n\n2.  **Initial Energy Calculation**:\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.272 MeV.\n    *   The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.544 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Final Energy Calculation**:\n    *   Four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$) are produced. Each has a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Due to conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the energy will be distributed equally among the four final particles. Each particle will have the same speed $v$ and the same Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy of one A particle is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2 = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Solving for Velocity**:\n    *   Equating initial and final energies: $1876.544 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Solving for the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$: $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.544}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$.\n    *   Using the relation $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$:\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.5638)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 1/2.4455} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$.\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.7688c$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    The calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c, which corresponds to option D. The Python code execution confirms this result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
