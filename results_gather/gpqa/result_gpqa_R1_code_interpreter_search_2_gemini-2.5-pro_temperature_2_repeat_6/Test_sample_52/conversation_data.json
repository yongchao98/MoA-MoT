    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Provided Information\n\nFirst, let's dissect the information given about the unknown compound:\n*   **Structure:** It's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This strongly suggests a benzene ring with two substituents (a C6H4 group).\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the molecule contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six different chemical environments for the protons.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals implies a high degree of symmetry. Para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution) typically results in an AA'BB' system which often appears as two signals (two doublets), with each signal integrating to 2 protons. This is the most plausible arrangement. Thus, we have a C6H4 fragment contributing 4 hydrogens to the formula.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (forming a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (forming a quartet). This combination results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This fragment is -CH=CH-CH3, which has a formula of C3H5. It contributes two vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n    *   **Two –CH3 signals:** We've already identified one -CH3 group from the propenyl substituent. The second -CH3 signal must come from the other substituent.\n    *   **No –CH2 signals:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), n-propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc. Since we have an ester group and need a second -CH3 group without any -CH2 groups, the most likely possibilities are a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-O-CO-CH3). In both cases, this fragment contributes a -CH3 group, a -COO- group, and no -CH2- groups. The formula for this fragment is C2H3O2.\n\n### 2. Assembling the Molecular Structure and Formula\n\nNow, let's combine these fragments to determine the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic core:** C6H4 (4 hydrogens)\n*   **Substituent 1 (from vinyl signals):** Propenyl group, -C3H5 (5 hydrogens)\n*   **Substituent 2 (from ester and 2nd CH3 signal):** Methyl ester or acetate fragment, -C2H3O2 (3 hydrogens)\n\nLet's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### 3. Verification\n\nLet's verify this result.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    Our proposed structure contains a benzene ring (DoU = 4), a C=C double bond (DoU = 1), and a C=O double bond (DoU = 1). The total DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. This is consistent.\n*   **NMR Signals:** Our proposed structure (e.g., Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate) would have:\n    *   2 aromatic signals (from the para-substituted ring).\n    *   2 vinyl signals (from the -CH=CH- part).\n    *   2 methyl signals (one from -CH=CH-CH3 and one from -COOCH3).\n    *   This gives a total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals, matching the data.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** The proposed structure has no -CH2- groups.\n\nThe formula C11H12O2 perfectly fits all the given spectroscopic data. Comparing this to the options:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
