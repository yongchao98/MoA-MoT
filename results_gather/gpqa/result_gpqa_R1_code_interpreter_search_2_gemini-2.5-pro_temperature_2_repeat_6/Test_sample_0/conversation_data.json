    "The fundamental principle at play here is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nWhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (also known as the energy width or natural linewidth).\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\nFor an estimate, we can use the relation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference between their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the spread or uncertainty of the levels. The most restrictive condition is set by the state with the shorter lifetime, as it will have a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE).\n\nLet's calculate the energy uncertainty for both states.\nFirst, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s:\nħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n**1. Calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:**\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**2. Determine the condition for resolution:**\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). For the two levels to be resolvable, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this dominant energy width.\nTherefore, the required energy difference is:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**3. Compare with the given options:**\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is less than the required separation.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much less than the required separation.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is less than the required separation.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is significantly greater than the required separation (10⁻⁴ >> 6.6 × 10⁻⁷).\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\nTo verify the calculation:\n```python\n# The reduced Planck constant in eV.s\nhbar_evs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Energy uncertainties (linewidths)\ndelta_E1 = hbar_evs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_evs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 1 (shorter lifetime): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 2 (longer lifetime): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nThe condition for the levels to be clearly resolved is that their energy difference\")\nprint(f\"must be significantly greater than the larger energy width, which is {delta_E1:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 1e-8 eV < {delta_E1:.3e} eV -> Not resolvable\")\nprint(f\"B) 1e-11 eV < {delta_E1:.3e} eV -> Not resolvable\")\nprint(f\"C) 1e-9 eV < {delta_E1:.3e} eV -> Not resolvable\")\nprint(f\"D) 1e-4 eV > {delta_E1:.3e} eV -> Clearly resolvable\")\n```\n>Energy width of State 1 (shorter lifetime): 6.582e-07 eV\n>Energy width of State 2 (longer lifetime): 6.582e-08 eV\n>\n>The condition for the levels to be clearly resolved is that their energy difference\n>must be significantly greater than the larger energy width, which is 6.582e-07 eV.\n>\n>Checking the options:\n>A) 1e-8 eV < 6.582e-07 eV -> Not resolvable\n>B) 1e-11 eV < 6.582e-07 eV -> Not resolvable\n>C) 1e-9 eV < 6.582e-07 eV -> Not resolvable\n>D) 1e-4 eV > 6.582e-07 eV -> Clearly resolvable\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem is to determine the minimum energy difference required to resolve two quantum states with given lifetimes.\n\n**1. Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The core concept is the time-energy uncertainty principle, which states that ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. This means that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt = τ) cannot have a perfectly defined energy; it has an inherent energy width or uncertainty (ΔE).\n*   **Calculating Energy Width:** We can estimate this minimum energy width as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, their energy separation must be larger than their energy widths. The state with the *shorter* lifetime will have the *larger* energy width, and this larger width sets the limit for resolution. The energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be significantly greater than the larger of the two energy widths.\n\n**2. Calculation:**\n\n*   **State 1:** Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **State 2:** Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n**3. Analysis:**\n\n*   The larger energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   To resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than this value: |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   Now we compare this requirement with the given options:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficiently large to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<D>>>"
