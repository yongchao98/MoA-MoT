    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scenario:**\n    *   We have a high-vacuum chamber inside a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).\n    *   There are two distinct situations described, both at the same temperature and gas density.\n    *   **Situation 1:** Before the electron beam is on. We are considering the movement of the residual gas molecules. The mean free path (MFP), λ1, is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with *another gas molecule*.\n    *   **Situation 2:** After the electron beam is on. We are considering the movement of the high-energy electrons from the beam. The mean free path, λ2, is the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a *residual gas molecule*.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions.\n    *   The general formula for MFP is: `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n        *   `n` = number density of the target particles (the particles being collided with).\n        *   `σ` (sigma) = the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" of the target for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the MFP Formula to Both Scenarios:**\n    *   For λ1 (gas-gas collisions):\n        *   Moving particle: a gas molecule.\n        *   Target particles: other gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of target particles is `n_gas`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is `σ_gas-gas`. This cross-section is based on the physical size of the molecules (their kinetic diameter). It's essentially a measure of how large a target a molecule presents to another molecule.\n        *   Therefore, `λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)`\n\n    *   For λ2 (electron-gas collisions):\n        *   Moving particle: an electron.\n        *   Target particles: gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of target particles is also `n_gas`, since the pressure and temperature of the gas haven't changed.\n        *   The collision cross-section is `σ_electron-gas`. This describes the scattering of an electron by a gas molecule.\n        *   Therefore, `λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)`\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   The core of the problem lies in comparing `σ_gas-gas` and `σ_electron-gas`.\n    *   **`σ_gas-gas` (Kinetic Collision):** This is a collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is very short-range, essentially requiring them to physically \"touch\" (their electron clouds to overlap significantly). This cross-section is related to the molecule's physical diameter.\n    *   **`σ_electron-gas` (Electron Scattering):** This is a collision between a charged particle (the electron) and a neutral atom/molecule (which is composed of a positive nucleus and a negative electron cloud). The electron interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force. The electron can be deflected (scattered) by the atom's electric field even if it passes quite far from the nucleus. This makes the effective target area for the electron much larger than the physical size of the gas molecule. An electron doesn't need to \"hit\" the molecule in the traditional sense; it just needs to interact with its electromagnetic field to be scattered.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because the electrostatic interaction is long-range, the effective target area presented by a gas molecule to an electron is significantly larger than the target area it presents to another neutral gas molecule. Therefore, `σ_electron-gas > σ_gas-gas`.\n\n5.  **Relate the Cross-Sections back to the Mean Free Paths (λ):**\n    *   We have the equations:\n        *   `λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)`\n        *   `λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)`\n    *   We know `n_gas` is the same for both.\n    *   We determined that `σ_electron-gas > σ_gas-gas`.\n    *   Since the mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section `σ`, a larger cross-section results in a smaller mean free path.\n    *   Because `σ_electron-gas` is larger, `λ2` must be smaller than `λ1`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This implies λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: Correct. This matches our physical reasoning. A larger probability of collision (larger cross-section) for the electron means it travels a shorter distance on average before a collision occurs.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This implies λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The physical nature of the collisions is fundamentally different, so there is no reason to expect the MFPs to be equal. Mike's observation is consistent with physics.\n\nThe irrelevant numbers in the problem (1000 kV, < 10^-9 Torr, 1.22) are distractors. The core concept is the comparison of the collision types.\n\n<<<B>>>"
