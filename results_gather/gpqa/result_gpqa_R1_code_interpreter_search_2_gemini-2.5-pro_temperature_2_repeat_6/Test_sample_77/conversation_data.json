    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical situation:** We are dealing with a moving point charge and need to find the electromagnetic potentials (scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$) it generates at a specific point in space and time. This is a classic problem in electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Recall the concept of retarded time:** The fields (and potentials) produced by a moving charge propagate at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` depends on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, called the retarded time, `tr`. The retarded time is defined such that the time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is exactly `t - tr`.\n    Let $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the position of the charge at the retarded time. The distance the signal travels is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    Thus, the retarded time `tr` is determined by the implicit equation:\n    $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n3.  **Use the retarded potential formulas:** The general solutions for V and $\\vec{A}$ for time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the retarded potential integrals:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n4.  **Model the moving point charge:** For a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the integrals:** Substituting these densities into the potential formulas and performing the integration is a non-trivial step because the retarded time `tr` in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard derivation, found in advanced electromagnetism textbooks (e.g., Griffiths), yields the following results:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}| (1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s})}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}| (1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s})}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The notation $[...]_{\\text{ret}}$ means that all quantities inside the brackets—$\\vec{s}$, $\\vec{v}$, and $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|_—are to be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n6.  **Simplify using the problem's notation:**\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the charge's velocity at the retarded time.\n\n    The denominator can be rewritten as:\n    $d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this into the expressions for V and $\\vec{A}$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n7.  **Match with the given options:** To match the form given in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    Denominator: $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})c = dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$\n\n    So the potentials become:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n8.  **Compare with choices:**\n    *   A) Incorrect form for V, which is for a static charge.\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   C) Incorrect sign in the denominator. The `.` product term subtracts from `dc`, it does not add.\n    *   D) Incorrect form for V, which is for a static charge.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct representation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
