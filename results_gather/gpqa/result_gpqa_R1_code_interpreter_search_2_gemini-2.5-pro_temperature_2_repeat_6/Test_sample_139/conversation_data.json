    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This points towards common elements used in isotopic labeling, like Hydrogen (Deuterium, D) or Carbon (¹³C).\n    *   **Clue 2: The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.** 277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This temperature is remarkably close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that B is D₂O and that Deuterium is the heavier isotope involved.\n    *   **Clue 3: A gas W is released whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze simple gas molecules, knowing Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron) is involved:\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Total protons = 2, Total neutrons = 2. (p=n). This is a strong candidate.\n        *   Other candidates like N₂, CO, O₂ also have p=n but are less likely given the D₂O clue.\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, forming gas W and precipitate G. Heating G releases B (D₂O).** This describes a chemical transformation. If heating G produces D₂O, G must be a deuterated compound that dehydrates (or de-deuterates) upon heating, such as a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)n).\n    *   **Clue 5: Substance X's reaction with a keto acid (R-CO-COOH) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms.** A keto acid has 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms suggests a reduction reaction, where both the ketone (C=O) and carboxylic acid (COOH) groups are reduced. Common reducing agents are metal hydrides.\n    *   **Clue 6: X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This points away from simple substances like metal deuterides (e.g., CaD₂) and towards more common laboratory reagents.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Combining the clues: We are looking for a deuterium-containing reducing agent, widely used in organic chemistry, that reacts violently to produce D₂ gas and a metal deuteroxide that releases D₂O upon heating.\n    *   **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** fits perfectly. Its non-deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a staple, powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   Let's check LiAlD₄ against the clues:\n        *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ reacts violently with heavy water (D₂O) which can be our liquid Y.\n            `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)`\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a solid precipitate. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G:** When heated, aluminum deuteroxide decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. This releases heavy water (B), matching the melting point clue.\n        *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a diol (e.g., `R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)`), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This fits.\n\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of all atoms of these elements found in the molecule. We will use integer mass numbers since the answer choices are integers.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (²H or D) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of Aluminum (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   **Mass contribution from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Deuterium (D₄) in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the two contributions.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\n# Identification of the substance:\n# Based on the chemical properties described (reaction with a liquid to produce a gas with p=n,\n# formation of a precipitate that releases heavy water upon heating, and its role as a strong\n# reducing agent in organic chemistry), Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n\n# Elements in LiAlD4 are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotopic form Deuterium, D).\n\n# Identify the lightest and heaviest elements by atomic number.\n# Lightest: Hydrogen (Z=1)\n# Middle: Lithium (Z=3)\n# Heaviest: Aluminum (Z=13)\n\n# The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n# We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n# Mass number of the Hydrogen isotope present (Deuterium, D) = 2.\n# Mass number of the stable Aluminum isotope (27Al) = 27.\n\n# Get the count of each required atom from the formula LiAlD4.\nnum_atoms_lightest_element = 4  # There are four Deuterium atoms.\nnum_atoms_heaviest_element = 1  # There is one Aluminum atom.\n\n# Calculate the total mass for each element.\ntotal_mass_lightest = num_atoms_lightest_element * 2\ntotal_mass_heaviest = num_atoms_heaviest_element * 27\n\n# Calculate the final cumulative mass.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance B**\n    The problem states that substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K. To understand this, we convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius:\n    Temperature (°C) = 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (deuterium oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C. The proximity of these values is a strong indicator that **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Infer the Isotope and Gas W**\n    Since B is D₂O, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue must be **Deuterium (D or ²H)**, an isotope of hydrogen with one proton and one neutron.\n    The problem states that a gas W is released, and its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's test Deuterium gas (D₂):\n    *   Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule has (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons.\n    The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deduce the Nature of Substance X**\n    The problem describes several reactions involving Substance X:\n    1.  **X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing D₂ (W) and forming a precipitate G.**\n    2.  **Heating the precipitate G releases D₂O (B).** This suggests G is a metal deuteroxide which dehydrates upon heating (e.g., M(OD)n → Metal Oxide + D₂O).\n    3.  **X reacts with a keto acid (general structure R-CO-COOH, containing 3 oxygen atoms) to yield a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.** This indicates that X is a strong reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohols (e.g., R-CO-COOH → R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH), which has 2 oxygens).\n    4.  **X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This points towards a common laboratory chemical.\n\n    A powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry that incorporates hydrogen is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"close analog\" containing the heavier deuterium isotope would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's see if this fits all the clues:\n    *   LiAlD₄ is a potent reducing agent.\n    *   It reacts violently with water (or heavy water, D₂O). The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It forms precipitates of Lithium Deuteroxide (LiOD) and Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), which is our substance G.\n    *   When heated, Aluminum Deuteroxide decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases heavy water (B).\n    *   LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is strong enough to reduce a keto acid to a diol, which fits the oxygen count clue.\n    Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄). The integer answer choices suggest using integer mass numbers.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of H, Z=1).\n    *   **Lightest element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (present as Deuterium).\n    *   **Heaviest element (by atomic number):** Aluminum.\n    *   The mass number of Deuterium (D) is 2.\n    *   The mass number of Aluminum (Al) is 27.\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains **4 atoms** of the lightest element (D) and **1 atom** of the heaviest element (Al).\n    *   Cumulative mass from the lightest element (Deuterium) = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Total cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n```python\n# The substance X has been identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The elements in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n\n# Identifying the lightest and heaviest elements based on their atomic number (Z).\n# Lightest element: Hydrogen (Z=1).\n# Heaviest element: Aluminum (Z=13).\n\n# We need to calculate the sum of the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule.\n# We will use integer mass numbers as implied by the integer answer choices.\nmass_of_deuterium = 2\nmass_of_aluminum = 27\n\n# From the formula LiAlD4, we find the number of atoms for each element.\nnum_deuterium_atoms = 4\nnum_aluminum_atoms = 1\n\n# Calculate the total mass contribution from each of the required elements.\ntotal_mass_from_deuterium = num_deuterium_atoms * mass_of_deuterium\ntotal_mass_from_aluminum = num_aluminum_atoms * mass_of_aluminum\n\n# Sum these masses to get the final answer.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_from_deuterium + total_mass_from_aluminum\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
