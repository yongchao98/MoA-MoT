    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Initial and Final State Energies:**\n    *   The initial nucleus is at rest. Its total energy is its rest-mass energy.\n        *   `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`, and kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n    *   The total energy of the final state is the sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments.\n        *   `E_final = m1*c^2 + T1 + m2*c^2 + T2`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Masses and Total Kinetic Energy:**\n    *   We are given that the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n        *   `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * (M * c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   By conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n        *   `300 GeV = (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) + (T1 + T2)`\n        *   `300 GeV = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2)`\n    *   The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is:\n        *   `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   We are also given the ratio of the rest masses: `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n    *   We can now find the individual rest-mass energies:\n        *   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        *   `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        *   `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` -> `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n        *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   So, the more massive fragment (`m1`) has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV, and the less massive fragment (`m2`) has a rest-mass energy of 99 GeV.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy `T1_relativistic`:**\n    *   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\n        *   `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    *   The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy (T), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c²) is given by `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n    *   Since the momentum magnitudes are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n        *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n    *   Substitute the known values (`m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`) and the relation `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`:\n        *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n        *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   The `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n        *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n        *   `600*T1 = 603`\n        *   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy for the more massive fragment: `T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy `T1_classical`:**\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   From momentum conservation (`p1=p2`), we have `sqrt(2*m1*T1) = sqrt(2*m2*T2)`, which simplifies to `m1*T1 = m2*T2`.\n    *   This gives the ratio of kinetic energies: `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n    *   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, we have `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, or `T2 = 2*T1`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is still `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting for `T2`:\n        *   `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`\n        *   `3*T1 = 3 GeV`\n        *   `T1 = 1 GeV`.\n    *   This is the kinetic energy calculated using the classical approximation: `T1_classical = 1000 MeV`.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   The difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n        *   `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation is verified using a Python script.\n```python\n# Initial parameters in GeV\nMc2_initial = 300.0\n\n# Calculate final state properties\nm_sum_c2_final = 0.99 * Mc2_initial\nQ_total_GeV = Mc2_initial - m_sum_c2_final\n\n# The problem states m1 = 2*m2.\n# So m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 2*m2c^2 + m2c^2 = 3*m2c^2 = m_sum_c2_final\nm2c2_GeV = m_sum_c2_final / 3.0\nm1c2_GeV = 2.0 * m2c2_GeV\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# From conservation of momentum, p1^2 = p2^2.\n# Using E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, this implies E1^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2c^2)^2.\n# Substituting E = T + mc^2 gives T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2.\n# We also know T2 = Q_total - T1.\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = (Q_total - T1)^2 + 2*(Q_total - T1)*m2c2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = Q_total^2 - 2*Q_total*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q_total*m2c2 - 2*T1*m2c2\n# The T1^2 terms cancel.

    "**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\n*   Initial nucleus is at rest. Its total energy is its rest-mass energy.\n    *   `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n*   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n    *   `(m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * (M * c^2)`\n*   The final state consists of the two fragments having kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n    *   `E_final = m1c^2 + T1 + m2c^2 + T2`\n\n**2. Calculate Q-Value and Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the final fragments is:\n    *   `(m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n*   Energy is conserved, so `E_initial = E_final`.\n    *   `300 GeV = (m1c^2 + m2c^2) + (T1 + T2)`\n    *   `300 GeV = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2)`\n*   The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference:\n    *   `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n*   Now, find the individual rest-mass energies using the mass ratio `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`:\n    *   `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `(2 * m2c^2) + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV`  => `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   `m1c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculate `T1` using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Physics**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum requires the fragments to have equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = p2`.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, which can be rearranged to `p^2 = 2mT`.\n*   Since `p1^2 = p2^2`, we have:\n    *   `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n    *   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    *   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`, so `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`:\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**4. Calculate `T1` using Relativistic Physics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   Again, conservation of momentum gives `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy, momentum, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Setting the momentum terms equal:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c^2)`\n*   Substitute the known values (`m1c^2=198` GeV, `m2c^2=99` GeV) and the relation `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    *   `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Solve for `T1`:\n    *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n    *   `T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV`\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\n*   The difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value:\n    *   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    *   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe code confirms this calculation.\n```python\n# Constants derived from the problem description\nMc2_initial = 300.0  # GeV\nm_sum_c2_final = 0.99 * Mc2_initial  # GeV\nQ_total_GeV = Mc2_initial - m_sum_c2_final  # GeV\n\n# Calculate rest mass energies of the two fragments\n# We are given m1 = 2*m2, so m1c^2 = 2*m2c^2\n# m1c^2 + m2c^2 = m_sum_c2_final\n# 2*m2c^2 + m2c^2 = m_sum_c2_final\n# 3*m2c^2 = m_sum_c2_final\nm2c2_GeV = m_sum_c2_final / 3.0\nm1c2_GeV = 2.0 * m2c2_GeV\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# T1 + T2 = Q_total\n# m1*T1 = m2*T2  => T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2 => T2 = 2*T1\n# T1 + 2*T1 = Q_total => 3*T1 = Q_total\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_total_GeV / 3.0\nT1_classical_MeV = T1_classical_GeV * 1000\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# From p1^2 = p2^2 and (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2), we have:\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c^2)\n# With T2 = Q_total - T1, the equation becomes a linear equation for T1:\n# T1 * (2*m1c2 + 2*m2c2 + 2*Q_total) = Q_total^2 + 2*Q_total*m2c2\nT1_relativistic_GeV = (Q_total_GeV**2 + 2 * Q_total_GeV * m2c2_GeV) / (2 * m1c2_GeV + 2 * m2c2_GeV + 2 * Q_total_GeV)\nT1_relativistic_MeV = T1_relativistic_GeV * 1000\n\n# --- Difference ---\ndifference_MeV = T1_relativistic_MeV - T1_classical_MeV\n\nprint(f\"The difference is {difference_MeV:.0f} MeV.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
