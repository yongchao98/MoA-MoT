    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which can be written as T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation it absorbs and the thermal radiation it emits. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) * R_star^2 / (4 * a^2) )^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star = Star's temperature\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   A = Planet's albedo\n    *   a = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for a Ratio:** I need to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2. Let's write out the expressions for each planet:\n    *   T_eq4 = T_star * ( (1 - A_4) * R_star^2 / (4 * a_4^2) )^(1/4)\n    *   T_eq2 = T_star * ( (1 - A_2) * R_star^2 / (4 * a_2^2) )^(1/4)\n\n    Now, let's form the ratio:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ T_star * ( (1 - A_4) * R_star^2 / (4 * a_4^2) )^(1/4) ] / [ T_star * ( (1 - A_2) * R_star^2 / (4 * a_2^2) )^(1/4) ]\n\n4.  **Cancel Common Terms:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same and cancel out.\n    *   The constant '4' cancels out.\n    *   The problem states the planets have the same albedo, so A_4 = A_2. The term (1-A) cancels out.\n\n    After cancellation, the ratio simplifies to:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (1 / a_4^2)^(1/4) ] / [ (1 / a_2^2)^(1/4) ]\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ 1 / a_4^(1/2) ] / [ 1 / a_2^(1/2) ]\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = a_2^(1/2) / a_4^(1/2)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (P):** The problem gives information about the orbital periods (P), not the orbital distances (a). I need a way to connect these two quantities. Kepler's Third Law provides this relationship:\n    P^2 ∝ a^3\n    This can be written as a ratio for two planets in the same system:\n    (P_4 / P_2)^2 = (a_4 / a_2)^3\n\n6.  **Solve for the Distance Ratio (a_2 / a_4):** I need to rearrange Kepler's Law to match the term in my temperature ratio equation, which is sqrt(a_2 / a_4).\n    First, let's find (a_4 / a_2):\n    (a_4 / a_2) = (P_4 / P_2)^(2/3)\n    Now, let's find the inverse, (a_2 / a_4):\n    (a_2 / a_4) = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Equation:** Now I can substitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    From this, I can find the ratio P_2 / P_4:\n    P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, I'll plug the numbers into the final equation and compute the result.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    I will use Python to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of orbital periods P2/P4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n0.8296229569614349\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.83. This corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n- Equilibrium temperature dependency on semi-major axis: T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2). Correct.\n- Kepler's Third Law: P^2 ∝ a^3 => a ∝ P^(2/3). Correct.\n- Combining the two: T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). Correct.\n- Therefore, T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3). Correct.\n- Period ratio P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5. Correct.\n- Calculation: (2/3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83. Correct.\n\nThe reasoning is sound and the calculation is correct.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of an exoplanet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) * R_star^2 / (4 * a^2) )^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the surface temperature of the host star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the host star.\n*   A is the albedo of the planet (reflectivity).\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance).\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which is T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [T_star * ( (1 - A_4) * R_star^2 / (4 * a_4^2) )^(1/4)] / [T_star * ( (1 - A_2) * R_star^2 / (4 * a_2^2) )^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out. The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo (A_4 = A_2), so the (1 - A) term cancels out. The constant '4' also cancels. This simplifies the equation to:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (1 / a_4^2)^(1/4) ] / [ (1 / a_2^2)^(1/4) ]\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / a_4^(1/2)) / (1 / a_2^(1/2))\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = a_2^(1/2) / a_4^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)\n\nNow, we need to relate the semi-major axis (a) to the orbital period (P). Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n\nP^2 ∝ a^3\nTherefore, (P_2 / P_4)^2 = (a_2 / a_4)^3.\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\na_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\nSubstitute this back into our temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods for Planet_1 to Planet_5 as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\nFrom this, we have:\n*   The ratio value for P_2 is 2.\n*   The ratio value for P_4 is 3.5.\n\nSo, the period ratio P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5.\n\nNow, we can calculate the final temperature ratio:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nLet's compute the value using the provided code output. The calculation of (2/3.5)^(1/3) resulted in approximately 0.8298.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get ~0.83. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
