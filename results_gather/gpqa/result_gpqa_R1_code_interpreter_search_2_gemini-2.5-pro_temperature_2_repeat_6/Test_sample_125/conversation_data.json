    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a single stereocenter at carbon 5 (C-5), and its configuration is specified as (S). This means the starting material is a pure enantiomer and is chiral.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces ketones to alcohols.\n    *   The ketone group at C-3 is reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C-3.\n\n3.  **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The original stereocenter at C-5 is unaffected by the reaction and remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The new stereocenter at C-3 can have either an (R) or a (S) configuration.\n    *   Since the attacking hydride can approach the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, two possible products are formed:\n        *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because one stereocenter is the same (S at C-5) while the other is different (R vs. S at C-3). Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both ketone groups are reduced.\n    *   The ketone groups at C-2 and C-4 are both reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n\n3.  **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This product has two stereocenters, at C-2 and C-4.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (equal amounts of enantiomers).\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product 2A)\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product 2B)\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product 2C)\n    *   Product 2A and Product 2B are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images). They will be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   Product 2C has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group, making it an achiral **meso compound**. Note that (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound.\n    *   The meso compound (2C) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers (2A and 2B).\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Mixture in HPLC**\n\nThe final combined mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (1A)\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (1B)\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (2A)\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (2B)\n*   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (2C)\n\n#### **1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the separable groups:\n    1.  Product 1A and 1B are diastereomers, so they will separate into **two peaks**.\n    2.  The racemic mixture of 2A and 2B will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    3.  The meso compound 2C is a diastereomer of the racemic pair (2A/2B), so it will be separated from them, giving another **single peak**.\n    4.  The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols) and will not co-elute.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **2. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between stereoisomers.\n*   It **can** separate both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, each unique stereoisomer in the mixture should produce a separate peak (assuming ideal separation).\n*   Let's count the unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (1 peak)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (1 peak)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (1 peak)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (1 peak)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (1 peak)\n*   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.**\n*   **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
