    "The user is asking for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have a particle $X^0$ with a rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$) of 3.41 GeV.\n    *   This particle has a total energy (E) of 27 GeV in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber).\n    *   The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) of $X^0$ (its lifetime in its own rest frame) is $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   The goal is to find the minimum resolution `L` of the detector needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of these decay events.\n\n2.  **Understand \"Observing Decays\" and Detector Resolution:**\n    *   A particle decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution limit, `L`, before it decays. If the particle decays after traveling a distance `d < L`, its track is too short to be distinguished from the production point, and the decay is missed.\n    *   Therefore, we need the fraction of particles that travel a distance `d > L` to be at least 30%.\n\n3.  **Apply Physics Principles (Special Relativity):**\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to its high speed. This is given by the formula $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor relates the total energy and rest mass energy: $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$.\n    *   **Decay as an Exponential Process:** Particle decay is a random, exponential process. The probability that a particle survives for a time `t` in the lab frame is $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$.\n    *   **Decay Length:** The distance a particle travels in time `t` is $d = v \\times t$, where `v` is the particle's velocity. Since $\\gamma$ will be large, the velocity `v` will be extremely close to the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The characteristic distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame is the mean decay length, $\\lambda = v \\times \\tau \\approx c \\times \\tau = c \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition:**\n    *   The probability of a particle traveling a distance `d` greater than `L` is equivalent to the probability of it surviving for a time `t` greater than `L/v`.\n    *   $P(d > L) = P(t > L/v) = e^{-(L/v)/\\tau} = e^{-L/(v\\tau)} = e^{-L/\\lambda}$.\n    *   We are given that this probability must be at least 30%, so:\n        $e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n    *   To find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition, which represents the largest possible value for `L` (i.e., the worst acceptable resolution):\n        $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    *   Solving for `L`:\n        $L = -\\lambda \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Values:**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   Then, calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$.\n    *   Finally, calculate the resolution, `L`.\n\nWe will use a python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants and given values\nc = 3e8  # Speed of light in m/s\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in s\nE = 27  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (lambda)\n# The velocity v is approximately c for a highly relativistic particle.\n# lambda = v * tau = v * (gamma * tau_0) â‰ˆ c * gamma * tau_0\nlab_lambda = c * gamma * tau_0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the required resolution L\n# The condition is that the fraction of observed decays (d > L) is at least 30%.\n# P(d > L) = exp(-L / lab_lambda) >= 0.3\n# We solve for the maximum L that satisfies this (i.e., the minimum required resolution).\n# L = -lambda * ln(0.3)\nL = -lab_lambda * np.log(0.3)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{L:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.28e-06\nThe computed value for the resolution `L` is approximately $2.28 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### Final Answer Selection\n\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nOur calculated value of $2.28 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to option A. The minor difference might be due to a slightly different value used for the speed of light (e.g., $2.9979 \\times 10^8$ m/s) or rounding in the problem's intended solution. Option A is the only one in the correct order of magnitude.\n\nLet's re-calculate using a more precise value for `c`:\nIf $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^8$ m/s,\n$L = - (2.99792458 \\times 10^8) \\times (\\frac{27}{3.41}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16}) \\times \\ln(0.3) \\approx 2.278 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The result is almost identical.\n\nLet's assume the number in option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the correct answer and see if we can work backward.\n$L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3) \\approx 1.204 \\lambda$\nSo, $\\lambda = L / 1.204 = (2.08 \\times 10^{-6}) / 1.204 \\approx 1.73 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nNow, $\\lambda = c \\gamma \\tau_0 = c \\frac{E}{m_{X^0}c^2} \\tau_0$.\n$1.73 \\times 10^{-6} = (3 \\times 10^8) \\frac{27}{m_{X^0}c^2} (8 \\times 10^{-16})$.\n$m_{X^0}c^2 = (3 \\times 10^8) \\frac{27}{1.73 \\times 10^{-6}} (8 \\times 10^{-16}) \\approx 3.75$ GeV.\nThis suggests the mass used to generate the options might have been slightly different (e.g., 3.75 GeV instead of 3.41 GeV).\n\nHowever, given the provided values, our calculation robustly points to a value very near option A. Therefore, A is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires us to calculate the minimum spatial resolution of a detector needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to a stationary observer (in the lab frame) than its lifetime in its own rest frame (proper lifetime). This is called time dilation.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$): $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$): $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$.\n*   **Particle Decay:** Particle decay is a random, exponential process. The probability that a particle survives for a time `t` (or travels a distance `d = vt`) is governed by an exponential decay law.\n*   **Observing a Decay:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance `L` that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution before it decays. If it decays at a distance smaller than the resolution, the decay vertex is indistinguishable from the production vertex.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Mathematical Problem**\n\nThe fraction of particles that travel a distance `d` greater than `L` before decaying is given by:\n$P(d > L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\nWe are given that this fraction must be at least 30%, so:\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nWe need to find the resolution `L`. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\", which in this context means the largest acceptable value for `L` that satisfies the condition. So we solve for the equality:\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L = -\\lambda \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n\nThe mean decay length $\\lambda$ is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying, which is given by $\\lambda = v \\times \\tau$, where `v` is the particle's velocity and $\\tau$ is its lifetime in the lab frame.\n$\\lambda = v \\times (\\gamma \\tau_0)$.\n\n### **3. Perform the Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's list the given values:\n*   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV.\n*   Rest mass of $X^0$, $m_{X^0}c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n*   Proper lifetime of $X^0$, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n\nWe can calculate the required quantities step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.**\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_{X^0}c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$.**\nFor a highly relativistic particle, its velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The mean decay length is $\\lambda = v \\gamma \\tau_0$.\nA more precise way to express this is using momentum, $p$. We know $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$ and $p = \\gamma m_0 v$.\nFrom this, the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0}\\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2}c\\tau_0$.\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the required resolution, L.**\n$L = -\\lambda \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n\nWe will use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in s\nc = 2.99792458e8  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate momentum in units of GeV/c\npc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (lambda)\n# lambda = (p/m0) * tau0 = (pc / m0c^2) * c * tau0\nlab_lambda = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau_0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the required resolution L\n# The fraction of decays observed (distance > L) is P(d>L) = exp(-L/lambda)\n# We need P(d>L) >= 0.3, so we solve for L in exp(-L/lambda) = 0.3\nL = -lab_lambda * np.log(0.3)\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"The calculated minimum resolution L is: {L:.2e} m\")\n```\nExecuting this calculation:\n1.  `pc = np.sqrt(27**2 - 3.41**2) = np.sqrt(729 - 11.6281) = np.sqrt(717.3719) \\approx 26.78` GeV/c\n2.  `lab_lambda = (26.78 / 3.41) * (2.998e8) * (8e-16) \\approx 7.853 * 2.398e-7 \\approx 1.8837e-6` m\n3.  `L = - (1.8837e-6) * np.log(0.3) \\approx - (1.8837e-6) * (-1.204) \\approx 2.268e-6` m\n\nThe calculated resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### **4. Compare with Options and Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated value is $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nOur calculated result is numerically closest to option A. The difference of about 9% is likely due to slightly different initial values being used to generate the options. Options B, C, and D are of completely different orders of magnitude and are incorrect. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
