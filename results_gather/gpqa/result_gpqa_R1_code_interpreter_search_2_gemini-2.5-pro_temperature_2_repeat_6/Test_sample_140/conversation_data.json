    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Reactants and Reaction Type\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the position C1 has a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and the adjacent position C2 has a deuterium atom (D). All other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms (H).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂). This is a very strong base (the active base is the amide anion, NH₂⁻).\n*   **Solvent:** Liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, forming a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form the benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2. This leads to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    5.  The resulting intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. (Note: The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is slower due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still possible).\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C2.\n    3.  The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2.\n    5.  Since the deuterium atom was removed, the resulting intermediate is **benzyne** with no deuterium.\n\n     \n\nSo, we have two possible benzyne intermediates: **3-deutero-benzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n### Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)\n\nThe second step of the mechanism is the addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne intermediate. In this reaction, the amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as the nucleophile.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deutero-benzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** NH₂⁻ attacks C1. This forms a carbanion at C6. This carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃) to give the final product. The NH₂ group is at C1, and the D atom is at C2. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** NH₂⁻ attacks C6. This forms a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH₃ gives the product. The NH₂ group is at C6, and the D atom is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium atom is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The nucleophile NH₂⁻ attacks the benzyne intermediate, which has no deuterium. The triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Due to the symmetry of the attacking nucleophile and the benzyne with respect to the final protonation step, attack at either C1 or C2 leads to the same product. The carbanion formed is protonated by the solvent (NH₃). The final product has no deuterium and is simply **aniline**.\n\n     \n\n### Conclusion: Counting the Products\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct possible organic products:\n1.  **2-Deuteroaniline**\n2.  **3-Deuteroaniline**\n3.  **Aniline**\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
