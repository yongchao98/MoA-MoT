    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of cyclohexanone with bromine (Br2)**\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Under neutral or acidic conditions, bromine adds to the alpha-carbon of the ketone.\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br2\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heat**\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. Treating it with a base like NaOH, especially with heat, strongly suggests a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\nThe mechanism is as follows:\n1.  NaOH, a base, abstracts the most acidic proton on the other side of the carbonyl (the α'-proton at C6).\n2.  An enolate is formed between C1 and C6.\n3.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack, where the carbanion at C6 attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n4.  The hydroxide ion (OH-) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained bicyclic ketone.\n5.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, leading to the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring. The ring opens to form the more stable carbanion, which results in a ring contraction.\n6.  After an acidic workup (implicit in this type of reaction), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagents:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagents:** SOCl2, pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\nNow, we need to determine the number of unique proton environments (signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum) in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nAt room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid pseudorotation. This means we consider the time-averaged conformation, which possesses a plane of symmetry (a C_s plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 carbon it's attached to, the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nWe can analyze the protons based on this symmetry:\n1.  **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton lies on the plane of symmetry. It is unique. (1 type of H)\n2.  **C1 proton (-CH-CHO):** This proton also lies on the plane of symmetry. It is unique. (1 type of H)\n3.  **C2 and C5 protons:** The C2 and C5 positions are equivalent, being mirror images of each other through the plane. Let's look at the two geminal protons on C2. They are diastereotopic because C1 is a prochiral center (substituting one H vs the other would create a diastereomer). Thus, the two protons on C2 are non-equivalent. By symmetry, the same is true for C5. The \"up\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"up\" proton on C5, and the \"down\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"down\" proton on C5. This means the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types of H)\n4.  **C3 and C4 protons:** The C3 and C4 positions are equivalent by symmetry. Let's analyze the two geminal protons on C3. These two protons are also diastereotopic. Replacing one of them with another group (e.g., Deuterium) would create two chiral centers (at C3 and C1), and the resulting molecules from replacing one H versus the other are diastereomers. Therefore, the two protons on C3 are non-equivalent. By symmetry, the same applies to C4. The \"up\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the \"down\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent. Thus, the four protons on C3 and C4 give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types of H)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming up the number of distinct hydrogen types:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1 H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = 6 types.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
