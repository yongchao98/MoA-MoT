    "The problem asks for the kinematically allowed decay channels of a boson $X$ with mass $m_X = 6$ GeV into fermion-antifermion pairs. The interaction is described by the Lagrangian:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\left(y\\right)=-\\lambda{f}\\bar{\\psi}{f}\\left(y\\right)\\left(\\upsilon+X\\left(y\\right)\\right)\\psi_{f}\\left(y\\right) $$\n\nThis Lagrangian contains the interaction term that mediates the decay of the boson $X$ into a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$):\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) X(y) \\psi_f(y) $$\nThis is a three-point interaction, and the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$ is the lowest order process allowed by this interaction.\n\nFor a decay to be \"kinematically allowed\", the mass of the decaying particle must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products. For the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, the condition is:\n$$ m_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\nSince a fermion and its corresponding antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ m_X > 2m_f $$\nWe are given that the mass of the boson $X$ is $m_X = 6$ GeV. Plugging this value into our condition, we get:\n$$ 6 \\text{ GeV} > 2m_f $$\n$$ \\implies m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nSo, the boson $X$ can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair $f\\bar{f}$ where the mass of the fermion $f$, $m_f$, is less than 3 GeV. We need to check this condition for all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons).\n\nLet's list the approximate masses of the quarks and leptons:\n**Quark Masses:**\n*   $m_u$ (up quark) $\\approx 2.2$ MeV $= 0.0022$ GeV\n*   $m_d$ (down quark) $\\approx 4.7$ MeV $= 0.0047$ GeV\n*   $m_s$ (strange quark) $\\approx 95$ MeV $= 0.095$ GeV\n*   $m_c$ (charm quark) $\\approx 1.27$ GeV\n*   $m_b$ (bottom quark) $\\approx 4.18$ GeV\n*   $m_t$ (top quark) $\\approx 173$ GeV\n\n**Charged Lepton Masses:**\n*   $m_e$ (electron) $\\approx 0.511$ MeV $= 0.000511$ GeV\n*   $m_\\mu$ (muon) $\\approx 105.7$ MeV $= 0.1057$ GeV\n*   $m_\\tau$ (tau lepton) $\\approx 1.777$ GeV\n\nNow, we check which of these fermions satisfy the condition $m_f < 3$ GeV:\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   $m_u = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV} < 3$ GeV. **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$).\n*   $m_d = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV} < 3$ GeV. **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$).\n*   $m_s = 0.095 \\text{ GeV} < 3$ GeV. **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$).\n*   $m_c = 1.27 \\text{ GeV} < 3$ GeV. **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$).\n*   $m_b = 4.18 \\text{ GeV} > 3$ GeV. **Not allowed**.\n*   $m_t = 173 \\text{ GeV} > 3$ GeV. **Not allowed**.\n\n**Charged Leptons:**\n*   $m_e = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV} < 3$ GeV. **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$).\n*   $m_\\mu = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV} < 3$ GeV. **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$).\n*   $m_\\tau = 1.777 \\text{ GeV} < 3$ GeV. **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$).\n\n(Note: Neutrinos also have masses much smaller than 3 GeV, so decays to neutrino-antineutrino pairs are also kinematically allowed, but they are not included in the options).\n\nCombining all the allowed decay channels into quarks and charged leptons, we get:\n$X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$, $s\\bar{s}$, $u\\bar{u}$, $d\\bar{d}$, $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$, $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$, $e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\nNow we compare this list with the given options:\nA) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: This is incorrect because the decay to a top-antitop pair ($t\\bar{t}$) is not kinematically allowed.\nB) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: This is incorrect because the decay to a bottom-antibottom pair ($b\\bar{b}$) is not kinematically allowed, and it omits the allowed charm-anticharm ($c\\bar{c}$) decay.\nC) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: This is incorrect for multiple reasons: it includes the forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ decay and omits the allowed $c\\bar{c}$ and $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decays.\nD) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: This list perfectly matches our derived set of kinematically allowed decay channels.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
