    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the core concepts:** The problem involves the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. This method works by detecting the periodic Doppler shift in the light from a star, caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\n2.  **Relate the observables to physical quantities:**\n    *   The primary observable is the periodic shift of a spectral line, $\\Delta \\lambda$.\n    *   This wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$). The Doppler shift formula is $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The *amplitude* of this periodic shift, $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$, is what corresponds to the RV semi-amplitude, denoted as $K$.\n    *   Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n\n3.  **Establish the relationship between given values:**\n    *   We are given the wavelength shifts for the two systems: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms.\n    *   From the proportionality in the previous step, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n        Or, inversely:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n4.  **Derive the physical formula for RV semi-amplitude ($K$):**\n    The RV semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    Where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight. The term $m_p \\sin(i)$ is often called the \"minimum mass\" and is what is directly constrained by RV measurements.\n\n5.  **Analyze the formula based on the problem's conditions:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). When used in the context of the RV method, this implies that the minimum masses are similar, i.e., $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) \\approx m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n    *   $G$ and $2\\pi$ are constants.\n\n    Given these conditions, most terms in the formula for $K$ are constant for both systems. The relationship between $K$ and the orbital period $P$ simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Set up the ratio to solve for the periods:**\n    From the proportionality $K \\cdot P^{1/3} = \\text{constant}$, we can write the equation for the two systems:\n    $K_1 P_1^{1/3} = K_2 P_2^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    $\\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n    To solve for the period ratio, we cube both sides:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3$\n\n7.  **Calculate the final answer:**\n    Substitute the known ratio of the semi-amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3$\n\n    Now, we perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-amplitudes, K1/K2\nratio_K = 5 / 7\n\n# Cube this ratio to find the period ratio, P2/P1\nperiod_ratio = ratio_K**3\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_code>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
