    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Physics Concepts:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($d$) of a particle is its average velocity ($v$) multiplied by its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$). So, $d = v \\cdot \\tau$.\n    *   Due to time dilation in special relativity, the lifetime of a moving particle in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = E / (m c^2)$, where $E$ is the total energy and $m$ is the rest mass of the particle. In particle physics, we often use natural units where $c=1$, so $\\gamma = E/m$.\n    *   The velocity of the particle is given by $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n    *   The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:**\n    Let's substitute the expressions into the formula for the decay distance:\n    $d = v \\cdot \\tau = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$\n    Now, substitute the expression for $\\tau_0$:\n    $d = \\beta \\gamma c (\\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}) = \\beta \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    This formula directly connects the mean decay distance to the quantities given in the problem and physical constants.\n\n4.  **Calculate the necessary components:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   Energy $E_{X} = 8$ GeV\n        *   Mass $m_{X} = 1.2$ GeV\n        *   Decay width $\\Gamma_{X} = 320$ MeV\n    *   **Physical constant:**\n        *   We need the value of $\\hbar c$. A convenient value is $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3$ MeV·fm.\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:**\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_{X}}{m_{X}} = \\frac{8 \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.667$\n    *   **Calculate the term $\\beta\\gamma$:**\n        We can use the relation $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$. A more direct way is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n        The momentum is also given by $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$.\n        Therefore, $pc = \\beta\\gamma(mc^2)$.\n        Solving for $\\beta\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n        Plugging in the values (with c=1):\n        $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Distance:**\n    Now, plug all the values into the combined formula:\n    $d = \\beta\\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    $d \\approx 6.5912 \\cdot \\frac{197.3 \\text{ MeV·fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n    $d \\approx 6.5912 \\cdot 0.61656$ fm\n    $d \\approx 4.064$ fm\n\n6.  **Convert to SI Units:**\n    The question asks for the answer in meters.\n    $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15}$ m.\n    $d \\approx 4.064 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\n7.  **Final Check with a Python Script for Precision:**\nTo ensure the calculation is accurate and not subject to rounding errors, a python script is used.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE_X = 8.0  # GeV\nm_X = 1.2  # GeV\nGamma_X = 320.0  # MeV\n\n# Physical constant\nhbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804  # MeV*fm\n\n# Calculate beta*gamma\n# The term beta*gamma is equal to p/m, where p is the momentum.\n# From E^2 = p^2 + m^2 (in units where c=1), we get p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2).\nmomentum_p = np.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X**2)\nbeta_gamma = momentum_p / m_X\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance d = beta*gamma * (hbar*c / Gamma)\n# All units must be consistent.
