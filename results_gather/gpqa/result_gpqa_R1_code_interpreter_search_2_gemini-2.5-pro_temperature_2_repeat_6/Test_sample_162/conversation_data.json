    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction**\n\n*   We need to dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, `Fe(OH)3`, which is a weak base.\n*   To do this, we add a monobasic strong acid (like HCl or HNO3), which provides H+ ions.\n*   The overall reaction is a neutralization reaction: `Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) -> Fe^3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)`.\n*   This reaction shows that for every 1 mole of `Fe(OH)3` we want to dissolve, we need to add at least 3 moles of `H+` from the acid. Any acid added beyond this stoichiometric amount will remain in the solution, making it acidic and determining its final pH.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\n*   First, we need the molar mass of `Fe(OH)3`.\n    *   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of `Fe(OH)3` = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   Now, we calculate the moles of `Fe(OH)3` in the 0.1 g sample.\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles of `Fe(OH)3` = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.00093575 mol.\n\n**3. Calculate the Stoichiometric Amount of Acid**\n\n*   From the reaction stoichiometry (`Fe(OH)3` : `3H+`), we can find the moles of `H+` required just to neutralize all the `Fe(OH)3`.\n    *   Moles of `H+` (stoichiometric) = 3 * Moles of `Fe(OH)3`\n    *   Moles of `H+` (stoichiometric) = 3 * 0.00093575 mol = 0.00280725 mol.\n*   This is the minimum amount of acid needed to consume the solid. To ensure it *stays* dissolved and to create the final acidic solution, we will need to add slightly more than this amount.\n*   Let's calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid corresponding to this stoichiometric amount.\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration\n    *   Volume (stoichiometric) = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n    *   Volume (stoichiometric) = 28.07 cm³.\n\n**4. Analyze the Options**\n\n*   The minimum volume of acid required to dissolve the solid must be *at least* 28.07 cm³.\n*   Looking at the options:\n    *   A) 20.40 cm³ (Too low)\n    *   B) 30.09 cm³ (Sufficient)\n    *   C) 32.14 cm³ (Sufficient)\n    *   D) 28.05 cm³ (Slightly too low)\n*   Based on this, we can eliminate options A and D. We need to check if option B or C is internally consistent, meaning the given volume of acid results in the given pH.\n\n**5. Test the Consistency of the Remaining Options**\n\nThe logic is: `Total H+ Added` = `H+ Used for Reaction` + `Excess H+` which determines the pH.\n\n*   **Test Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    1.  **Total Moles of H+ added**:\n        *   Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n        *   Moles H+ = Concentration * Volume = 0.1 M * 0.03009 L = 0.003009 mol.\n    2.  **Moles of excess H+**:\n        *   Excess H+ = Total H+ added - H+ used for reaction\n        *   Excess H+ = 0.003009 mol - 0.00280725 mol = 0.00020175 mol.\n    3.  **Final [H+] concentration**:\n        *   This excess H+ is in the total solution volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n        *   [H+] = Moles / Volume = 0.00020175 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0020175 M.\n    4.  **Calculate the pH**:\n        *   pH = -log10([H+]) = -log10(0.0020175) ≈ 2.695.\n\n    This calculated pH (2.695) is an excellent match for the pH given in option B (2.69).\n\n*   **Test Option C: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    1.  **Total Moles of H+ added**:\n        *   Volume = 32.14 cm³ = 0.03214 L\n        *   Moles H+ = 0.1 M * 0.03214 L = 0.003214 mol.\n    2.  **Moles of excess H+**:\n        *   Excess H+ = 0.003214 mol - 0.00280725 mol = 0.00040675 mol.\n    3.  **Final [H+] concentration**:\n        *   [H+] = 0.00040675 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0040675 M.\n    4.  **Calculate the pH**:\n        *   pH = -log10(0.0040675) ≈ 2.39.\n\n    This calculated pH (2.39) does not match the pH given in option C (3.16).\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nOption B is the only choice where the provided volume of acid is sufficient to dissolve the `Fe(OH)3` and where the amount of excess acid accurately produces the stated pH of the final solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants\nmolar_mass_FeOH3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) # M_Fe + 3 * (M_O + M_H)\nmass_FeOH3 = 0.1  # g\nacid_conc = 0.1  # M\ntotal_volume = 0.1  # L (100 cm3)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3 and the stoichiometric moles of H+ needed for reaction\nmoles_FeOH3 = mass_FeOH3 / molar_mass_FeOH3\nmoles_H_plus_stoich = 3 * moles_FeOH3\n\n# Step 3: Check option B\nV_acid_B_cm3 = 30.09 # cm3\nV_acid_B_L = V_acid_B_cm3 / 1000.0\n\n# Calculate the resulting pH for the volume given in Option B\nmoles_H_plus_added_B = acid_conc * V_acid_B_L\nmoles_H_plus_excess_B = moles_H_plus_added_B - moles_H_plus_stoich\nconc_H_plus_final_B = moles_H_plus_excess_B / total_volume\ncalculated_pH_B = -math.log10(conc_H_plus_final_B)\n\nprint(f\"Stoichiometric volume of acid required: {moles_H_plus_stoich / acid_conc * 1000:.2f} cm3\")\nprint(f\"For Option B (V = {V_acid_B_cm3} cm3):\")\nprint(f\"  The given pH is 2.69\")\nprint(f\"  The calculated pH from the given volume is: {calculated_pH_B:.2f}\")\nprint(\"Conclusion: The values in Option B are consistent.\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
