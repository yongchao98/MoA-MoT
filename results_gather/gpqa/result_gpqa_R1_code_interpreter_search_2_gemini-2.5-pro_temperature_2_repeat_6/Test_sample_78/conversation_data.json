    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra**\n    The problem provides the 1H and 13C NMR spectra for the product obtained after Compound X (C11H12O) is reacted. Let's deduce the structure of this product.\n\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** The reactant is C11H12O. The reaction conditions (heating with a base catalyst) suggest an isomerization, meaning the product likely has the same molecular formula, C11H12O. We can verify this from the NMR data.\n        *   **1H NMR:** Summing the protons gives 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12 hydrogens. So, H12.\n        *   **13C NMR:** Summing the carbons gives 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 carbons. So, C11.\n        *   The 13C signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (ketone or aldehyde), indicating the presence of an oxygen atom.\n        *   The product's molecular formula is indeed C11H12O. The reaction is an isomerization.\n\n    *   **Structure Determination from NMR:**\n        *   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C11H12O, DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6. This suggests a benzene ring (4 DBE) and two additional double bonds or rings. The carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for one DBE, leaving one more, likely a C=C double bond.\n        *   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n            *   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two non-equivalent methyl groups that are not coupled to any protons. The chemical shifts are typical for a methyl group on an aromatic ring (Ar-CH3) and a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl (acetyl group, -COCH3).\n            *   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): Two protons on a double bond coupled to each other. The large difference in chemical shifts suggests a conjugated system, likely an enone (-CH=CH-C=O). The coupling constants would confirm a *trans* configuration.\n            *   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n            *   δ 197.7: Confirms the presence of a ketone.\n            *   δ 21.3 and δ 28.4: Two methyl carbons. δ 21.3 is typical for Ar-CH3, and δ 28.4 for a keto-CH3.\n            *   The signals in the δ 126-145 ppm range correspond to the 6 carbons of the benzene ring and the 2 carbons of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n            *   We have a `p-disubstituted ring`, where one substituent is a methyl group (explaining the δ 2.28 signal and one set of aromatic protons).\n            *   The other substituent is a `but-3-en-2-one` fragment (`-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`).\n            *   Putting these together gives **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one** (also known as 4'-methylchalcone derivative or p-methylbenzalacetone).\n            *   Structure: `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3` (with para-substitution on the ring).\n            *   This structure is fully consistent with all NMR data and the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Compound X**\n    The reaction is the isomerization of Compound X (C11H12O) into 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. We need to identify which of the given options for Compound X could be the starting material. All options are vinyl epoxides. We must find the option whose molecular structure can rearrange to form the product. The key is that atoms are conserved; the fundamental carbon skeleton must match.\n\n    *   **Product Skeleton:** The product has a **p-tolyl group** (a methyl group attached to a phenyl ring at the para position) attached to a butenone chain.\n    *   Let's examine the skeletons of the options:\n        *   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The `4-methylstyryl` group is `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-`. This contains the required **p-tolyl group**. The overall skeleton `(p-tolyl)-C=C-C-O-C` can be isomerized to `(p-tolyl)-C=C-C(=O)-C`. **This is a match.** The reaction is a known (though mechanistically complex) rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide.\n        *   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This has a `styryl` group (`C6H5-CH=CH-`) and a methyl group on the oxirane ring. The methyl group is not attached to the phenyl ring. It contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. This cannot form the product.\n        *   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula is C10H10O, which does not match C11H12O.\n        *   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This has a `phenyl` group (`C6H5-`) and a methyl group on the double bond (`=C(CH3)-`). The methyl group is not attached to the ring. It contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. This cannot form the product.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Only compound A, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, has the correct carbon skeleton (a p-tolyl group) to form the product 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one through an isomerization reaction. The other options lack the p-tolyl group.\n\n<<<A>>>"
