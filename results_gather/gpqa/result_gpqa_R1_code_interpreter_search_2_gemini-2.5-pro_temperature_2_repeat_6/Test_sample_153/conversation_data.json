    "*   **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32%. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive characteristic of a compound containing a single chlorine atom, as chlorine has two major isotopes, ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance).\n    *   All four proposed structures have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. This is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Infrared Spectrum (IR):**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This information effectively rules out option B (an aldehyde) and option D (a chloroformate), as neither contains a carboxylic acid group. We are left with A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Proton NMR Spectrum (¹H NMR):**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is characteristic of the highly deshielded acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n        *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** A signal for two equivalent protons that are split into a doublet, meaning they have one neighboring proton.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** Another signal for two equivalent protons, also split into a doublet.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent.\n        *   **Option C (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is a para-substituted ring. The two protons next to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded (further downfield, i.e., 8.02 ppm) than the two protons next to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm). Each set of protons has only one adjacent, non-equivalent proton, resulting in a doublet for each. This perfectly matches the observed spectrum.\n        *   **Option A (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) ring. Due to the lack of symmetry, all four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments. This would lead to a much more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and the presence of chlorine. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm the carboxylic acid functional group. Finally, the symmetrical two-doublet pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum is only consistent with the para-substitution pattern of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
