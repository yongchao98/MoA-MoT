    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the key concepts:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution of stars:** This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere in space. The number of stars in any given volume `V` is simply `N = ρ * V`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance `d` of a star. The relationship is `plx = k/d`, where `k` is a constant. For simplicity and as is common in astronomy, we can set `k=1` by choosing appropriate units (parsecs for distance and arcseconds for parallax). So, `plx = 1/d` or `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the problem:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, depends on `plx`.\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars to distance:**\n    *   Let's consider all the stars up to a certain distance `d`. These stars occupy a sphere of radius `d`.\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3) * π * d^3`.\n    *   The total number of stars `N` within this sphere is `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`.\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    *   Since `d = 1/plx`, we can substitute this into the equation for `N`.\n    *   `N = ρ * (4/3) * π * (1/plx)^3 = (4πρ/3) * plx^(-3)`.\n    *   This equation gives the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a given `plx` (since a smaller distance `d` corresponds to a larger parallax `plx`).\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The quantity we want, `dN/d(plx)`, represents the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to parallax. This is the derivative of the expression for `N` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4πρ/3) * plx^(-3) ]`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`), we get:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ/3) * (-3 * plx^(-3-1))`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ/3) * (-3 * plx^(-4))`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ * plx^(-4)`\n\n6.  **Interpret the result:**\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as the parallax `plx` increases (meaning we are looking at closer stars), the total cumulative count of stars `N` decreases. When we talk about the \"number of stars per unit range\", we are interested in the density or magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `plx^(-4)` or `1/plx^4`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`\n\n7.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   A) ~ 1/plx^1\n    *   B) ~ 1/plx^4\n    *   C) ~ 1/plx^2\n    *   D) ~ 1/plx^3\n\n    Our derived relationship `~1/plx^4` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
