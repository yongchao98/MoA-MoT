    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Total Energy of the System**\n    In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle includes its rest energy. When this particle is subjected to an external conservative force with a potential energy $U(x)$, the total conserved energy of the system ($E_{total}$) is the sum of its relativistic energy and the potential energy.\n    The relativistic energy of the mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is $E_{rel} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy $E_{total}$ of the isolated system is constant throughout the motion. We can evaluate this constant energy at two specific points in the oscillation cycle: at the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude) and at the equilibrium position.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Energy at Maximum Displacement**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, $x = A$, the mass is momentarily at rest.\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Speed: $v = 0$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Energy at the Equilibrium Position**\n    At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero, and the speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$\n    *   Speed: $v = v_{max}$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum displacement must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first square both sides:\n    $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n    Now, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$ by multiplying by $c^2$ and taking the square root:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The derived expression for the maximum speed is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
