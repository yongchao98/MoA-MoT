    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (Compound X) from the provided spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad peak):** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer, broadened due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹, 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks indicate the presence of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this region is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm) show a distinct pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This is a tell-tale sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing them to be deshielded (shifted downfield). The two protons at 7.2 ppm are adjacent to the other substituent.\n        *   **Let's analyze the alkyl substituent signals:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives the fragment -CH₂-CH₃.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). This gives the fragment -CH-CH₃.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the first fragment. It is coupled to the CH₃ at 0.9 ppm and the CH group, making it a multiplet.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is attached directly to the benzene ring (it is a benzylic proton). It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n        *   **Assembling the structure:** We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with a -COOH group and an alkyl group. Piecing the alkyl fragments together, the benzylic CH is bonded to both a methyl group and an ethyl group. This forms a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on all the data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with **red phosphorus and HI**.\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red phosphorus (P) and hydriodic acid (HI) is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for its ability to completely reduce various functional groups.\n    *   **Reaction on Carboxylic Acids:** Red P and HI will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). This reduction involves the removal of both oxygen atoms and the addition of three hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Effect on other groups:** The aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be affected.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure of the final product.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   **Transformation:** The -COOH group is converted to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Match the product to the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material, Compound X)\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene (This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group)\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (This matches our predicted product)\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
