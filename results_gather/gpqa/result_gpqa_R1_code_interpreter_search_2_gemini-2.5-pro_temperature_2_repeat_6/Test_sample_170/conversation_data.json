    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understanding the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring dictates the position of the incoming bromine atom (regioselectivity) and the rate of reaction.\n\n*   **Activating groups** increase the reaction rate and are typically **ortho, para-directors**. They donate electron density to the ring.\n*   **Deactivating groups** decrease the reaction rate. Most deactivators are **meta-directors**. Halogens are an exception: they are deactivating but **ortho, para-directors**.\n\nThe question asks for the order of increasing yield of the *para*-isomer.\n\n**2. Classifying the Substituents**\n\nFirst, let's classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **1) -CH3 (Toluene):** Activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** Activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **6) -COOH (Benzoic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThis classification allows us to divide the substances into two main groups:\n*   **Group A (low para-yield):** The meta-directors (2, 4, 6). They will produce very little, if any, of the para-isomer.\n*   **Group B (high para-yield):** The ortho, para-directors (1, 3, 5). They will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n\nTherefore, the final sequence will have all substances from Group A before the substances from Group B.\n\n**3. Ordering Substances within Group A (Meta-directors)**\n\nThe substances are nitrobenzene (4), ethyl benzoate (2), and benzoic acid (6). For these compounds, the electrophile primarily attacks the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n\nTo order them, we can consider the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group leads to a more selective reaction at the meta position, meaning an even lower yield of ortho and para isomers.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOR\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It makes the ring very electron-poor, especially at the ortho and para positions. Bromination of nitrobenzene gives over 93% meta product, with only about 0.3% being the para isomer.\n*   **-COOH (6):** This is a strong deactivating group. Bromination of benzoic acid yields around 75-80% meta product, with less than 2% being the para-isomer.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2):** This group's deactivating strength is similar to -COOH. Data for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows ethyl benzoate gives about 3-4% para-isomer, which is slightly higher than for benzoic acid.\n\nBased on typical product distributions, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\nYields: (~0.3%) < (~1-2%) < (~3-4%)\n\nSo, the first part of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Ordering Substances within Group B (Ortho, para-directors)**\n\nThe substances are toluene (1), chlorobenzene (3), and ethylbenzene (5). For these, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. A higher para/ortho ratio means a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are a special case. Although they deactivate the ring via their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), they direct ortho/para via their electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The inductive effect is stronger at the ortho position than the para position. This strong deactivation of the ortho position leads to a high preference for para substitution. For bromination, chlorobenzene gives about 89% para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene) vs. -C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the para/ortho ratio between them is **steric hindrance**. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size makes it harder for the incoming electrophile (bromine) to attack the adjacent ortho positions. Consequently, substitution at the less hindered para position is more favored for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n    *   Bromination of toluene (1) yields about 67% para-isomer.\n    *   Since -C2H5 is bulkier, the para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene (5) will be greater than 67%.\n\n*   **Comparing all three (1, 3, 5):**\n    *   Toluene (1) has the lowest para yield at ~67%.\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3) has a very high para yield at ~89% due to electronic effects.\n    *   Ethylbenzene (5) has a para yield greater than 67%. The question is whether it's greater or less than chlorobenzene's 89%. While the steric effect of the ethyl group is significant, it's generally accepted in this comparison that the strong electronic effect in chlorobenzene results in a higher para selectivity. Furthermore, trend analysis from nitration reactions (Toluene 58% < Ethylbenzene 69% < Chlorobenzene 70%) supports this order. Therefore, it is most likely that the para yield for ethylbenzene is between that of toluene and chlorobenzene.\n\nThis gives us the order of increasing para-isomer yield:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\nYields: (~67%) < (>67% but <89%) < (~89%)\n\nSo, the second part of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Final Assembly**\n\nCombining the two ordered groups gives the complete sequence:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis matches option B provided in the question.\n\n<<<B>>>"
