    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the vinylic region, indicating a proton attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). Its downfield position suggests it's attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH=).\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to one proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning it's coupled to (adjacent to) only one other proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** A coupling constant of this magnitude (>12 Hz) is characteristic of two protons in a *trans* configuration across a double bond. Cis coupling constants are typically smaller (6-12 Hz).\n\n    2.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region, indicating the other proton on the double bond.\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal also corresponds to one proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n            *   The 'd' (doublet) arises from coupling to the single proton at 7.0 ppm across the double bond.\n            *   The 'q' (quartet) arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group).\n\n    3.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is a typical chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (CH3-C=O).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal corresponds to three protons, confirming a methyl group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is not split, meaning there are no protons on the adjacent atom. This is characteristic of an acetate group (CH3-C(=O)-O-).\n\n    4.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This value is in the allylic region, indicating a methyl group attached to a double bond (C=C-CH3).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal corresponds to three protons, confirming a methyl group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton. This confirms it is coupled to the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm, which is consistent with the 'q' in the 'dq' multiplicity of that signal.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   From the signals at 2.1 ppm and the overall context, we have an **acetate group**: `CH3-C(=O)-O-`.\n    *   From the other signals, we can deduce a **propenyl group**: `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   The coupling pattern confirms the connectivity. The `dq` at 5.5 ppm is the central `CH` of the propenyl group, coupled to both the other vinyl `CH` (giving the doublet) and the terminal `CH3` (giving the quartet).\n    *   The J-value of 16.0 Hz between the two vinyl protons (at 7.0 and 5.5 ppm) definitively establishes their stereochemistry as **trans**.\n    *   Putting it all together, the structure is `CH3-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH3` with a trans double bond. This is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The provided 1H NMR data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The key pieces of evidence are the presence of an acetate singlet, two coupled vinyl protons, and an allylic methyl doublet, with the large J-coupling constant (16.0 Hz) confirming the trans configuration.\n\n<<<D>>>"
