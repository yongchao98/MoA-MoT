    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A and its reaction.**\n*   Compound A has the molecular formula C3H6. This can be either propene (CH3-CH=CH2) or cyclopropane.\n*   The reaction is bromination in carbon tetrachloride (Br2/CCl4). This is a classic test for unsaturation (alkenes/alkynes). Propene readily undergoes this addition reaction.\n*   Reaction: CH3-CH=CH2 (Propene) + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n*   So, Compound A is **propene** and Compound B is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound C.**\n*   Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH.\n*   Alcoholic KOH is a strong base used for dehydrohalogenation (removal of HX). With a vicinal dihalide like 1,2-dibromopropane, two molecules of HBr are eliminated to form an alkyne.\n*   Reaction: CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alcoholic) → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n*   So, Compound C is **propyne**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound D.**\n*   Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube.\n*   This is a characteristic reaction for the cyclotrimerization of alkynes to form an aromatic ring. Three molecules of propyne will polymerize.\n*   Reaction: 3 CH3-C≡CH --(Red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n*   So, Compound D is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound E.**\n*   Compound D (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This indicates nitration, using concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   Mesitylene has three activating methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. These groups direct electrophilic substitution to the ortho and para positions (2, 4, 6). Due to symmetry, positions 2, 4, and 6 are identical.\n*   Reaction: Mesitylene + conc. HNO3 + conc. H2SO4 → 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + H2O\n*   So, Compound E is **2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify Compound F.**\n*   Compound E (2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl).\n*   This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   Reaction: 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n*   So, Compound F is **2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesitylamine)**.\n\n**Step 6: Identify Compound G.**\n*   Compound F (2,4,6-trimethylaniline), a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, generated in situ from NaNO2/HCl at 0-5 °C).\n*   This is the diazotization reaction, which converts the primary amino group to a diazonium salt group (-N2+).\n*   Reaction: 2,4,6-trimethylaniline + HNO2 + HCl → 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride + 2 H2O\n*   So, Compound G is **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n**Step 7: Identify Compound H.**\n*   Compound G (diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which typically involves warming with water.\n*   The diazonium group is a good leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a phenol.\n*   Reaction: 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt --(H2O, warm, NaOH)--> 2,4,6-trimethylphenol\n*   So, Compound H is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol (Mesitylol)**.\n\n**Step 8: Evaluate the given statements.**\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental building blocks for azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride (FeCl3) test is used to detect phenols. A positive test typically gives a distinct violet, green, or blue color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. The FeCl3 solution itself is yellow-brown. Due to the two methyl groups at the ortho positions to the hydroxyl group in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, there is significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the formation of the bulky colored complex. Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a *negative* ferric chloride test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution remains the original yellow color of the FeCl3 reagent. The statement \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product, whereas it simply describes the absence of a reaction. In chemical context, this is considered an incorrect description of the test outcome. Therefore, this statement is considered **incorrect**.\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature. As a small alkyne, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). The molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   The 9 protons of the three equivalent methyl groups will appear as one signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, it will be a singlet.\n    *   The 3 protons on the aromatic ring (at positions 2, 4, 6) are also equivalent and will appear as one signal. They have no non-equivalent neighbors to couple with, so this is also a singlet.\n    *   Thus, the 1H NMR spectrum consists of two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nStatements A, C, and D are correct. Statement B is incorrect because it misleadingly describes a negative chemical test result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
