    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between acid molecules, often causing the peak to span from 2500 cm⁻¹ to 3300 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is consistent with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the alkene functionality suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. Let's calculate its mass:\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragment strongly corroborates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which readily cleaves to form the stable [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Evidence and Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The combined spectral data points to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n    *   A carboxylic acid has one C=O bond, which counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   An alkene has one C=C bond, which counts as another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of at least **2 degrees of unsaturation**.\n    *   Now, let's examine the options by calculating the DoU for each formula using the formula: DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (where N=0 for these compounds).\n\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₀O:** Contains only one oxygen. Ruled out as a carboxylic acid needs two.\n    *   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** Contains only one oxygen. Ruled out as a carboxylic acid needs two.\n    *   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The evidence requires the compound to have 2 degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** has a DoU of 2, which perfectly accommodates one C=O bond and one C=C bond. The formula C₆H₁₂O₂ has only one degree of unsaturation, which could be a carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid) or an alkene, but not both.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
