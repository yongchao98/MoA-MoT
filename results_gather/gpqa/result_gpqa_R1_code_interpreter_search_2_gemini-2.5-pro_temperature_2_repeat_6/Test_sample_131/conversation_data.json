    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14. All given options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n    *   This indicates there are two chemically different types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, the 1:1 signal ratio means that the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second singlet.\n    *   A simple interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each of these singlets corresponds to the same number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n    *   These signals come from the methyl (CH3) groups.\n    *   The term \"singlet\" is crucial, as it rules out any alkyl groups that would show splitting (like ethyl groups).\n    *   The total number of methyl protons in a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 tetramethylbenzene isomers is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   The ratio 2:1:1 represents a total of 2+1+1 = 4 parts.\n    *   Therefore, the protons for each signal are: (2/4)*24H = 12H, (1/4)*24H = 6H, and (1/4)*24H = 6H. The three aliphatic signals correspond to 12H, 6H, and 6H, respectively.\n\n**2. Analyze the predicted 1H NMR spectra for each candidate compound**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals and their integration for each potential compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, there is only one type of aromatic proton (H3 and H6 are equivalent). They are isolated from each other, resulting in **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   All four methyl groups are equivalent, resulting in **one aliphatic singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   There are two non-equivalent aromatic protons (H4 and H6). Neither has an adjacent proton, so they appear as **two aromatic singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   There are three types of methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, and C5 is unique. This results in **three aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry, the two aromatic protons (H5 and H6) are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent, being chemically identical (an A2 system) means they don't split each other and appear as **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   There are two types of methyl groups: C1/C4 are equivalent, and C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two aliphatic singlets (6H and 6H)**, a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The formula is C10H14.\n    *   The aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one singlet (4H).\n    *   The ethyl groups give a quartet (CH2) and a triplet (CH3). This contradicts the observation that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that produces:\n*   Two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Three aliphatic singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio (representing 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\nLet's check the combination from the best candidate pair.\n\n**Combination: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option D)**\n\n*   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   A 1:1 mixture will show **two aromatic singlets**. Since each corresponds to 2 protons, their integral ratio will be 2H:2H or **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet corresponding to **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets, each corresponding to **6H**.\n    *   Combined, the mixture will show **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that fully accounts for all the features observed in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
