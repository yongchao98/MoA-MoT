    "Here's my reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes the decay of a positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). The pion is initially at rest. This is a classic two-body decay problem in particle physics, which requires the application of relativistic conservation laws.\n\n    The decay reaction is:\n    π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information and Necessary Assumptions:**\n    *   Parent particle: π⁺\n    *   Product particles: μ⁺ and ν\n    *   Initial state: The π⁺ is stationary, which means its initial velocity is 0, its initial kinetic energy is 0, and its initial momentum is 0.\n    *   Rest mass of π⁺ (M_π): 139.6 MeV/c²\n    *   Rest mass of μ⁺ (M_μ): 105.7 MeV/c²\n    *   Rest mass of neutrino (M_ν): In most such problems, the neutrino's mass is considered negligible and taken as 0. I will proceed with this standard assumption (M_ν = 0).\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n        The total momentum before the decay is zero because the pion is at rest. Therefore, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero.\n        `p_initial = p_final`\n        `0 = p_μ + p_ν`\n        This means the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n        `|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p`\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion. The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n        `E_initial = E_final`\n        `E_π = E_μ + E_ν`\n        Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest energy: `E_π = M_π * c²`.\n        The total energy of any particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest energy (`mc²`): `E = KE + mc²`.\n        So, the energy conservation equation becomes:\n        `M_π * c² = (KE_μ + M_μ * c²) + (KE_ν + M_ν * c²)`\n        For simplicity, I'll work in units where c=1, so energy and mass have the same units (MeV).\n        `M_π = (KE_μ + M_μ) + (KE_ν + M_ν)`\n        Since `M_ν = 0`, this simplifies to:\n        `M_π = (KE_μ + M_μ) + KE_ν`  (Equation 1)\n\n4.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n    `E² = (p * c)² + (m * c²)²`\n    Again, setting c=1: `E² = p² + m²`\n\n    *   For the muon (μ⁺): `E_μ² = p² + M_μ²`\n    *   For the neutrino (ν), with M_ν = 0: `E_ν² = p² + 0² => E_ν = p`. Because the neutrino is massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (`KE_ν = E_ν`).\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    We have a system of equations:\n    a) `M_π = E_μ + E_ν`\n    b) `E_μ² = p² + M_μ²`\n    c) `E_ν = p`\n\n    From (c), we can substitute `p` with `E_ν` in equation (b):\n    `E_μ² = E_ν² + M_μ²`\n\n    From (a), we can express `E_ν` in terms of `E_μ` and `M_π`:\n    `E_ν = M_π - E_μ`\n\n    Now, substitute this expression for `E_ν` into the modified equation (b):\n    `E_μ² = (M_π - E_μ)² + M_μ²`\n\n    Expand the squared term:\n    `E_μ² = M_π² - 2 * M_π * E_μ + E_μ² + M_μ²`\n\n    The `E_μ²` terms cancel out on both sides:\n    `0 = M_π² - 2 * M_π * E_μ + M_μ²`\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for `E_μ` (the total energy of the muon):\n    `2 * M_π * E_μ = M_π² + M_μ²`\n    `E_μ = (M_π² + M_μ²) / (2 * M_π)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    Now I can plug in the given values for the masses to find `E_μ`. Then I can find the kinetic energies. A python script is ideal for this calculation to avoid manual errors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given rest masses in MeV/c^2. We treat them as energy units in MeV.\nM_pi = 139.6  # MeV\nM_mu = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# --- Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) ---\n# Formula derived from conservation laws: E_mu = (M_pi^2 + M_mu^2) / (2 * M_pi)\nE_mu = (M_pi**2 + M_mu**2) / (2 * M_pi)\n\n# --- Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) ---\n# KE_mu = E_mu - (rest mass energy of muon)\nKE_mu = E_mu - M_mu\n\n# --- Calculate the energy of the neutrino (E_nu or KE_nu) ---\n# From energy conservation: E_total = E_mu + E_nu\n# M_pi = E_mu + E_nu => E_nu = M_pi - E_mu\nKE_nu = M_pi - E_mu\n\n# Print the results, formatted to two decimal places\nprint(f\"KE of muon: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>KE of muon: 4.12 MeV\n>KE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n\n7.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    The python code execution provides the following results:\n    *   Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_μ) is approximately 4.12 MeV.\n    *   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_ν) is approximately 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.\n\n    These two values are `4.12 MeV` and `29.8 MeV`. I will now compare this result with the given multiple-choice options.\n\n    A) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n    B) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n    C) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n    D) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\n    The calculated values perfectly match the values in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν) is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe reaction is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n*   The pion (π⁺) is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (M_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (M_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is assumed to be massless (M_ν = 0).\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n`p_μ = p_ν = p`\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion. The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`E_π = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n*   The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion: `E_π = M_π * c² = 139.6 MeV`.\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the products.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (p * c)² + (m * c²)²`.\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): `E_μ² = (p * c)² + (M_μ * c²)²`\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν): `E_ν² = (p * c)² + 0`, so `E_ν = p * c`.\n\nWe can substitute `p * c = E_ν` into the muon's energy equation:\n`E_μ² = E_ν² + (M_μ * c²)²`\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we have `E_ν = E_π - E_μ`. Substituting this into the previous equation:\n`E_μ² = (E_π - E_μ)² + (M_μ * c²)²`\n`E_μ² = E_π² - 2 * E_π * E_μ + E_μ² + (M_μ * c²)²`\n\nThe `E_μ²` terms cancel out. We can now solve for the total energy of the muon (`E_μ`):\n`2 * E_π * E_μ = E_π² + (M_μ * c²)²`\n`E_μ = (E_π² + (M_μ * c²)²) / (2 * E_π)`\n\nPlugging in the mass values (in units of MeV, with c=1 for simplicity):\n`E_μ = (139.6² + 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)`\n`E_μ = (19488.16 + 11172.49) / 279.2`\n`E_μ = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n`KE_μ = E_μ - M_μ * c² = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV`\n\nNow we find the energy of the neutrino. From energy conservation:\n`E_ν = E_π - E_μ = 139.6 MeV - 109.82 MeV = 29.78 MeV`\nSince the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy (`KE_ν`).\n`KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
