    "This problem requires us to relate the temperatures of two stars using the Boltzmann distribution, given information about the relative excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics Principles\n\n*   **Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):** The assumption that the stellar photospheres are in LTE allows us to use the laws of statistical mechanics that apply to systems in thermal equilibrium, specifically the Boltzmann distribution.\n*   **Boltzmann Distribution:** This equation describes the relative number of atoms in different energy levels at a given temperature. The ratio of the population of a higher energy state (N₂) to a lower energy state (N₁) is given by:\n\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)\n\n    where:\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Define Variables and Set Up the Equations\n\nLet's denote the specific excited energy level as state *j* and the ground state (or a reference lower state) as state *i*. The \"excitation level\" can be represented by the ratio of populations, Nⱼ/Nᵢ.\n\n*   Let T₁ be the temperature of star_1 and T₂ be the temperature of star_2.\n*   The excitation level in star_1 is: (Nⱼ / Nᵢ)₁ = (gⱼ / gᵢ) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁)\n*   The excitation level in star_2 is: (Nⱼ / Nᵢ)₂ = (gⱼ / gᵢ) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)\n\nThe energy levels *i* and *j* are intrinsic properties of the iron atom, so ΔE and the statistical weights (gⱼ, gᵢ) are the same for both stars.\n\n### 3. Apply the Given Information\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This translates to:\n\n(Nⱼ / Nᵢ)₁ = 2 * (Nⱼ / Nᵢ)₂\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relation:\n\n(gⱼ / gᵢ) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * [ (gⱼ / gᵢ) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂) ]\n\nThe statistical weight ratio (gⱼ / gᵢ) appears on both sides and can be canceled out:\n\nexp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)\n\n### 4. Solve for the Relationship between T₁ and T₂\n\nTo solve this equation, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln[exp(-ΔE / kT₁)] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n\n-ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n-ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) - ΔE / kT₂\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\n(ΔE / kT₂) - (ΔE / kT₁) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂) ] = ln(2)\n\n### 5. Use the Given Numerical Values\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\nThe value of the Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio (ΔE / k):\n(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nThis numerical coincidence is almost certainly intentional for simplification. Substituting (ΔE / k) = 1 into our derived equation:\n\n1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂) ] = ln(2)\n[ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂) ] = ln(2)\n\nThis result matches option C. Also, since ln(2) > 0, it implies that T₁ > T₂, which makes physical sense: the star with a higher degree of atomic excitation (star_1) should have a higher temperature."
