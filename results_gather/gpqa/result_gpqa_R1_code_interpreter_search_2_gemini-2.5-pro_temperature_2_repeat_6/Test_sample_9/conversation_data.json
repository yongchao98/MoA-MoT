    "*   **Analysis of each option:**\n\n    1.  **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This option serves as our reference point. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this as ρ_a. So, ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    2.  **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given directly. Let's call this ρ_b. So, ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density.\n\n    3.  **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** The key concept here is **gravitational compression**. For a planet with the same composition (e.g., the same ratio of iron to rock), a more massive planet will have stronger internal gravity. This stronger gravity compresses the materials (iron, rock) more tightly, leading to an increase in its overall density. A 5 Earth-mass planet (a \"Super-Earth\") will be significantly more compressed than Earth. Therefore, its density, ρ_c, will be significantly greater than Earth's density (ρ_a).\n        *   So, ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    4.  **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Using the same logic as in (c), but in reverse. A planet with less mass will have weaker internal gravity. This results in less compression of its materials compared to Earth. Therefore, its average density, ρ_d, will be lower than Earth's density (ρ_a).\n        *   So, ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n\n    *   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_b ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n    Based on this analysis, the density of planet (c) is the highest.\n\n*   **Quantitative Estimation (Optional):**\n    The relationship between mass (M) and radius (R) for rocky planets is not linear. A good approximation is R ∝ M^k, where k is around 1/3.7 for Super-Earths. Density (ρ) is Mass/Volume, so ρ ∝ M / R³. This means ρ ∝ M / (M^k)³ = M / M^(3k) = M^(1-3k).\n    *   Using k = 1/3.7, we get ρ ∝ M^(1 - 3/3.7) ≈ M^(1 - 0.81) ≈ M^0.19.\n    *   For planet (c), M = 5 M_Earth. Its density would be ρ_c ≈ (5^0.19) * ρ_Earth ≈ 1.35 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 7.4 g/cm³.\n    *   For planet (d), M = 0.5 M_Earth. Its density would be ρ_d ≈ (0.5^0.19) * ρ_Earth ≈ 0.88 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 4.8 g/cm³.\n\n    This calculation confirms our qualitative reasoning. The 5-Earth-mass planet is by far the densest.\n\nTherefore, the planet described in option (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
