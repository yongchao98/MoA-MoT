    "*   **Analyze the provided data:**\n    1.  **¹H NMR:** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   They have similar, but not identical, chemical shifts.\n        *   The total integral is 1H, with each peak having roughly half of that (0.5H), indicating the two species are in a ~1:1 ratio.\n        *   This is not due to spin-spin coupling.\n        *   This observation points to the presence of two distinct chemical species in the NMR tube that contain this alpha-proton, and these species are not rapidly interconverting on the NMR timescale.\n\n    2.  **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   **LC part:** Two clearly defined peaks are observed. This means there are two chemical species that have different physical/chemical properties (e.g., polarity) that allow them to be separated on the chromatography column.\n        *   **MS part:** Both separated peaks give the *same mass spectrum*, and this mass corresponds to the expected product. This is a critical piece of information. It means the two species are isomers – they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass.\n        *   **Temperature:** The analysis at \"elevated temperature\" resulting in two clear peaks suggests these two isomers are stable and do not readily interconvert even when heated, or at least that their interconversion is slow on the chromatographic timescale.\n\n*   **Evaluate the options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. By definition, they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they would *not* separate on a standard (achiral) LC column and would show only a single peak. They would also have identical ¹H NMR spectra in a standard (achiral) solvent, showing only one set of peaks. This contradicts both the LC and NMR data.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would be a different molecule. While it would likely show a separate peak in both LC and NMR, it would almost certainly have a *different mass* from the final product. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass, ruling out this option.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This term is chemically imprecise. If it means a side reaction occurred to form an isomer, this might be plausible. However, the most common \"problem\" in peptide synthesis that leads to isomers is racemization. Racemization at one stereocenter in a molecule that has other stereocenters creates diastereomers. Thus, this option essentially collapses into option D, which is a more precise chemical description. If \"double coupling\" meant, for example, two equivalents of an amino acid were added instead of one, the product would have a different mass, which contradicts the MS data.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. A common way to form them during peptide synthesis is through the partial or complete racemization of one amino acid's chiral alpha-carbon during the coupling step. For instance, coupling an L-amino acid to a mixture of D- and L-isomers of another amino acid results in a mixture of L-D and L-L dipeptides. These are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n        *   They are separable by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This explains the two LC peaks.\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct molecules, they give different NMR spectra. This explains the two sets of signals (e.g., for the alpha-proton).\n        *   Since they are isomers, they have the exact same molecular formula and mass. This explains why both LC peaks have the same mass spectrum.\n        Another possibility for diastereomers in peptides are *cis-trans* isomers around a peptide bond (often involving proline), which are also distinguishable by NMR and often separable by LC. Both racemization products (epimers) and *cis-trans* isomers (rotamers) fall under the category of diastereomers. This option is perfectly consistent with all the experimental observations.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two species that are isomers (same mass) but have different physical properties (separable by LC) and different NMR spectra is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
