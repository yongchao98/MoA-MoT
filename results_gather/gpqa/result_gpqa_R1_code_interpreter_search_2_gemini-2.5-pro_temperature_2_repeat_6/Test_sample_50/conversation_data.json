    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical System\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce a separation of charges within the conductor. Since the sphere is a conductor, these induced charges will rearrange themselves on the surface of the sphere to ensure that the electric field inside the conductor is zero and the potential on its surface is zero.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nTo solve this problem, we use a powerful technique called the \"method of images.\" This method allows us to replace the complicated induced charge distribution on the sphere's surface with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are then calculated as the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen precisely to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (V=0 at r=R).\n\nFor a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` is:\n\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external force to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the potential is zero) to its final position at distance `d`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work done by the electrostatic force as the charge `q` is brought from infinity to the distance `d`.\n\n`U = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n\nThe force `F(x)` on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and its image charge `q'`.\n\nAt a distance `x` from the center:\n*   The image charge magnitude is `q' = -q * (R/x)`\n*   The image charge position is `b = R^2 / x`\n*   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on `q` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R/x) / ((x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2)`\n`F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate this force to find the potential energy:\n`U = - ∫[∞ to d] [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫[∞ to d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`∫ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we apply the limits of integration:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2)) ]` from `∞` to `d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2 * (∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2)) - 0 ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method B: Using U = (1/2)qV\n\nThe total electrostatic energy `U` of a system of charges and conductors can be written as `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by *all other charges* in the system.\n\nOur system consists of the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`\n\n*   Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0. So, the second term is zero.\n*   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nBy the method of images, this potential is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\nThe distance between the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) and the real charge `q` (at `d`) is:\n`distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nThe potential `V_at_q` is:\n`V_at_q = k * q' / (distance)`\n`V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, we can find the total potential energy:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system.\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur derived expression matches option D perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
