    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. We need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (the moving frame) is `t₀ = 50 s`. This is the proper time.\n    *   We need to find the distance (d) traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame (the stationary frame).\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Determine the formula:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is calculated as `d = v * t`, where `t` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation in special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). The relationship is given by the formula: `t = γ * t₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))`.\n\n3.  **Combine the formulas:**\n    *   Substituting the expression for `t` into the distance formula, we get:\n        `d = v * (γ * t₀)`\n    *   Substituting the expression for `γ`, the full formula for the distance is:\n        `d = v * t₀ / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))`\n\n4.  **Calculate the values:**\n    *   We will now use a Python script to compute the final distance accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nv = 60000  # velocity of ejecta in km/s\nt0 = 50    # proper time in seconds in the ejecta's frame\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s (standard approximation for such problems)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c (beta)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the time 't' that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame\nt_galaxy = gamma * t0\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the distance 'd' traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * t_galaxy\n\nprint(distance_galaxy)\n```\n<execute_code>\n3061862.178478418\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\n5.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without considering relativistic effects, i.e., 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem involves the concept of time dilation from special relativity. We are given the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, and the time passed in the ejecta's own reference frame (proper time). We need to find the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**Here's the step-by-step breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Identify the given variables:**\n    *   Relative velocity (v) = 60,000 km/s\n    *   Proper time (t₀) in the ejecta's frame = 50 s\n    *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\n2.  **Determine what needs to be calculated:**\n    *   We need to find the distance (d) traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   The formula for distance is `d = v * t`, where `t` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n3.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    Time passes differently in the two reference frames. The time `t` in the Galaxy's frame (the \"stationary\" frame) is related to the proper time `t₀` in the ejecta's frame (the \"moving\" frame) by the time dilation formula:\n    `t = γ * t₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is given by:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - (v²/c²))`\n\n5.  **Combine the formulas to find the distance:**\n    Substitute the expression for `t` into the distance formula:\n    `d = v * t = v * (γ * t₀)`\n    Now substitute the expression for `γ`:\n    `d = v * t₀ / √(1 - (v²/c²))`\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   Calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Calculate `(v/c)²`:\n        `(0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Calculate `1 - (v/c)²`:\n        `1 - 0.04 = 0.96`\n    *   Calculate `√(1 - (v/c)²) = √0.96`:\n        `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   Calculate the time `t` in the Galaxy frame:\n        `t = t₀ / √0.96 = 50 s / 0.9798 ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy frame:\n        `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThe code output provided a more precise value of **3,061,862.178... km**.\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nOur calculated distance of ~3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
