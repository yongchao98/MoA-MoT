    "This problem requires us to determine which of two exoplanets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to compare the transit probability of Planet_1 with that of Planet_2. This means we need to calculate the ratio: `Probability(Planet_1) / Probability(Planet_2)`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_star`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `P_transit = R_star / a`\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** The semi-major axis (`a`) is not directly given. However, we can find it using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. The law states:\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star`\n    where `P` is the orbital period and `M_star` is the mass of the host star. We can ignore the planet's mass as it's typically negligible compared to the star's mass.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (`a`):**\n    Rearranging Kepler's Third Law to solve for `a`:\n    `a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_star`\n    `a ∝ (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas:** Now, substitute the expression for `a` into the transit probability formula:\n    `P_transit ∝ R_star / (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3)`\n    `P_transit ∝ R_star * P^(-2/3) * M_star^(-1/3)`\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting to the probability of Planet_2 transiting.\n    `Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2`\n    `Ratio = [R_star_1 * P_1^(-2/3) * M_star_1^(-1/3)] / [R_star_2 * P_2^(-2/3) * M_star_2^(-1/3)]`\n\n7.  **Plug in the Given Information:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same radii: `R_star_1 = R_star_2`\n    *   The period of Planet_1 is one-third that of Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`\n    *   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2: `M_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2`\n\n    Substitute these relationships into the ratio equation:\n    `Ratio = [R_star_2 * (P_2 / 3)^(-2/3) * (2 * M_star_2)^(-1/3)] / [R_star_2 * P_2^(-2/3) * M_star_2^(-1/3)]`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Cancel out the common terms (`R_star_2`, `P_2^(-2/3)`, `M_star_2^(-1/3)`):\n    `Ratio = [ (1/3)^(-2/3) * 2^(-1/3) ] / [ 1 ]`\n    `Ratio = (3^(-1))^(-2/3) * 2^(-1/3)`\n    `Ratio = 3^(2/3) * 2^(-1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (3^2)^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = 9^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    To find the final value, we need to compute the cube root of 4.5. Let's use Python for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities (Planet_1 / Planet_2)\nratio = (4.5)**(1/3)\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n1.650964003994348\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 1.65. This means that the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "### **Detailed Reasoning and Calculation**\n\n1.  **Define Transit Probability:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_star`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`), assuming a circular orbit.\n    `P_transit = R_star / a`\n\n2.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Parameters:** The semi-major axis (`a`) is not given directly. However, we can relate it to the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_star`) using Kepler's Third Law:\n    `P^2 = (4 * π^2 / (G * M_star)) * a^3`\n    Rearranging for `a`, we get:\n    `a = ( (G * M_star * P^2) / (4 * π^2) )^(1/3)`\n    Since `G` and `4π^2` are constants, we can express this as a proportionality:\n    `a ∝ (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:** Substitute the expression for `a` into the transit probability formula:\n    `P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`\n    `P_transit ∝ R_star * M_star^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`\n\n4.  **Establish the Ratio of Probabilities:** We need to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2.\n    `Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2`\n    `Ratio = (R_star_1 * M_star_1^(-1/3) * P_1^(-2/3)) / (R_star_2 * M_star_2^(-1/3) * P_2^(-2/3))`\n\n5.  **Input the Given Values:** The problem provides the following relationships:\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is one-third that of Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`\n    *   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2: `M_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2`\n    *   Both host stars have the same radii: `R_star_1 = R_star_2`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Substitute these relationships into the ratio formula:\n    `Ratio = (R_star_2 * (2 * M_star_2)^(-1/3) * (P_2 / 3)^(-2/3)) / (R_star_2 * M_star_2^(-1/3) * P_2^(-2/3))`\n    The terms `R_star_2`, `M_star_2^(-1/3)`, and `P_2^(-2/3)` cancel out from the numerator and the denominator.\n    `Ratio = (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)`\n    `Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n    `Ratio = (3^2 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** The code execution provided the result for this calculation.\n    `Ratio ≈ 1.65096`\n\nThis result shows that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
