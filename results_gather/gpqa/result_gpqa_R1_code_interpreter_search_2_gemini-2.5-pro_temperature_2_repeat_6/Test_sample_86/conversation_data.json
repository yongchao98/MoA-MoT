    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This implies a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents at positions 1,2 (ortho), 1,3 (meta), or 1,4 (para).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Possible Structure(s)**\n\nBased on the information above, we can determine the two substituents:\n*   Substituent 1: A halogen (-X).\n*   Substituent 2: A group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nLet's find the possible structure for the second substituent (let's call it 'Y'):\n*   If Y is an **acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃)**, it has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This is a valid structure. The compound would be a **haloacetophenone**.\n*   If Y is a **phenylacetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO)**, it has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8. This is also a valid structure. The compound would be a **halophenylacetaldehyde**.\n*   Other possibilities like esters (e.g., -COOCH₃) or acids (-CH₂COOH) also fit the C=8 and C=O criteria.\n\n**3. Analyze the Provided ¹H NMR Options**\n\nLet's analyze each NMR option to see which one matches our deduced structures. A key feature to look for is the pattern in the aromatic region (typically δ 7-8.5 ppm). A para-substituted (1,4) ring often shows a distinctive pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, due to the ring's symmetry.\n\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: This high chemical shift is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n    *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern for a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n    *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: This suggests a **methylene group (-CH₂-)**.\n    *   This data would suggest a *p-halophenylacetaldehyde* (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n    *   **Inconsistency check:** In this structure, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) is adjacent to the methylene protons (-CH₂-). Due to spin-spin coupling, the CHO signal should be a **triplet (t)**, and the CH₂ signal should be a **doublet (d)**. The provided data shows both as **singlets (s)**. This is a significant contradiction.\n\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Again, this is the pattern for a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n    *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This is characteristic of a **methyl group (-CH₃)** that is not adjacent to any other protons, typical for an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃). The chemical shift is also appropriate.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the structure of a **p-haloacetophenone** (X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃). This structure fits all the initial criteria: 8 carbons, di-substituted aromatic ring, C=O group, and an Ar-X bond.\n\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic region (δ ~7-8 ppm). It cannot represent an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 protons on the ring. The integration in the aromatic region here is only 1H, which is incorrect.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Option A describes a plausible structure but with incorrect NMR signal splitting.\n*   Option B perfectly describes the expected ¹H NMR spectrum for p-haloacetophenone, a molecule that satisfies all conditions given in the problem statement.\n*   Options C and D are inconsistent with the structure of a di-substituted aromatic compound.\n\nTherefore, the correct ¹H NMR data for the compound is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
