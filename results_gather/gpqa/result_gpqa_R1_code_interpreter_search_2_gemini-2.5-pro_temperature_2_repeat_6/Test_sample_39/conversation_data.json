    "*   **Analysis of the Context:** The conversation takes place between two synthetic organic chemists. A primary activity in synthetic organic chemistry is not just making a new compound (the product) but also purifying it from leftover starting materials, byproducts, and solvents. The statement \"my compounds are on top of each other\" coupled with \"Not well\" indicates a problem with a purification or separation process.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Purification Techniques:** Let's consider common separation techniques in organic chemistry and how they relate to the given options.\n    *   **Chromatography (e.g., Thin-Layer Chromatography [TLC] or Column Chromatography):** This is arguably the most common purification technique in a research lab. It separates compounds based on their differential adsorption to a stationary phase (like silica gel), which is primarily governed by the compounds' **polarity**. If a chemist runs a TLC plate to check their reaction mixture and sees that the spot for their desired product and the spot for an impurity are at the same height (i.e., they have the same Retention Factor, or Rf value), they would describe the spots as being \"on top of each other.\" This happens when the compounds have very similar polarities, making them difficult or impossible to separate using this method. This is a very frequent problem and the phrase is a perfect description of the visual result on a TLC plate or the co-elution from a column.\n    *   **Distillation:** This technique separates liquids based on their **boiling points**. If two compounds have very similar boiling points, they will co-distill, and the chemist would be unable to separate them. While one could colloquially say the compounds are \"on top of each other\" in the collection flask, the phrase is much more commonly associated with chromatography.\n    *   **Recrystallization:** This technique purifies solids based on differences in solubility. It doesn't fit the phrase as well as chromatography.\n    *   **Extraction:** This separates compounds based on their differential solubility in two immiscible liquids, a property related to polarity. Poor separation here is less commonly described as being \"on top of each other.\"\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options in Light of the Analysis:**\n    *   **A) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions:** While these forces exist, they are not the basis of a standard separation technique in this context, and \"on top of each other\" is not the standard way to describe them causing a problem.\n    *   **B) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property used for characterization, not typically for separation (separation of enantiomers requires specialized chiral chromatography). Two compounds (e.g., a product and an impurity) having similar rotations is not a common separation problem.\n    *   **C) Similar boiling points:** This is a plausible cause for a failed *distillation*. However, chromatography is a more common and versatile technique in modern synthetic labs, especially for the complex mixtures often produced.\n    *   **D) Similar polarities:** This is the most likely cause for a failed *chromatographic* separation, which is the most common purification method. The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a very common and literal description of how the unseparated compounds appear on a TLC plate.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is overwhelmingly used by organic chemists to refer to the failure to separate compounds by chromatography because they have nearly identical polarities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
