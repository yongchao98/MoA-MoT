    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) for two planets orbiting the same star.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `A` is the planet's bond albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I need to calculate T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star) )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    This is a key simplification. The ratio of temperatures depends only on the inverse square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes. To find the temperature ratio, I need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2/a1.\n\n4.  **Connect to Given Data (Radial Velocity):** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ). This information allows us to determine the properties of the planets' orbits.\n\n5.  **Relate Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The Doppler shift formula is Δλ / λ_0 = v_r / c, where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light. The maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\n    This means K is directly proportional to Δλ_max (since c and λ_0 are constants).\n    So, K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2.\n\n6.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit (given in the problem), and assuming the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), the star's RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n    where v_p is the orbital velocity of the planet.\n    The planet's orbital velocity is v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a) (again, assuming M_p << M_star).\n    Substituting v_p into the equation for K:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p * sqrt(G)) / sqrt(M_star * a)\n\n7.  **Isolate the Semi-Major Axis (a):** I need to find `a` in terms of the known quantities. Let's rearrange the formula:\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** Now I can use the expression for `a` to find the ratio a2 / a1. Note that G and M_star are the same for both systems and will cancel out.\n    a2 / a1 = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²) ]\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n9.  **Combine the Equations:** Now I can substitute this result back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 3.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)² )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\n    And since K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2 (from Step 5):\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\n10. **Plug in the Values and Calculate:** Now I'll substitute the numerical values from the problem statement into this final, simplified formula.\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Final Computation:** I will use a python script to get the precise decimal value.\n```python\n# Values from the problem\n# Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = 5.0 / 7.0\n\n# Ratio of Doppler shifts (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\ndoppler_shift_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by the product of these two ratios.\n# T_eq1/T_eq2 = (M_p2/M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\ntemperature_ratio = mass_ratio * doppler_shift_ratio\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n>0.5357142857142857\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    `T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))`\n    `T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n\n    The problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant for both) and have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n    `(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]`\n    `(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n    `(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star) )`\n    `(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n    This simplification shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the inverse square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes. Our next task is to find the ratio `a2 / a1`.\n\n4.  **Use Radial Velocity (RV) Data:** The problem provides information about the Doppler shift (`Δλ`) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`) by the formula `Δλ / λ_0 = v_r / c`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n5.  **Relate Doppler Shift to RV Semi-Amplitude (K):** The maximum Doppler shift `Δλ_max` corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as `K`. Thus, `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)`. Since `c` and `λ_0` are constants, `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n    `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n\n6.  **Connect RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet of mass `M_p` in a circular orbit around a star of mass `M_star`, the star's RV semi-amplitude (assuming `M_p << M_star`) is given by:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    Where `i` is the inclination of the orbit. Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on to our line of sight, meaning `i ≈ 90°` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    `K ≈ (M_p * sqrt(G)) / sqrt(M_star * a)`\n\n7.  **Isolate the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We need to express `a` in terms of the known parameters.\n    `K² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)`\n    Rearranging for `a`:\n    `a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** Now we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`. The constants `G` and `M_star` will cancel out.\n    `a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²)]`\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)`\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²`\n\n9.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, substitute this expression for `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)² )`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)`\n\n    Finally, replace the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes with the ratio of Doppler shifts (from step 5):\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`\n\n10. **Plug in Values and Calculate:** The problem provides the following values:\n    *   Mass of Planet1, `M_p1 = 7 M_earth`\n    *   Mass of Planet2, `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet1, `Δλ1 = 0.03 Å`\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet2, `Δλ2 = 0.04 Å`\n\n    Substitute these into the final formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 M_earth / 7 M_earth) * (0.03 Å / 0.04 Å)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n    To get the decimal value, we can perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n# M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n# delta_lambda_1 = 0.03 Å\n# delta_lambda_2 = 0.04 Å\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is:\n# (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\ntemperature_ratio = (5.0 / 7.0) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.5357, which rounds to 0.54 or 0.53. Looking at the options provided:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value `~0.536` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
