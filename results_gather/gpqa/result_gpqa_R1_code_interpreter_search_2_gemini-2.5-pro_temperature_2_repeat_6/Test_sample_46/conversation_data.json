    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2`\nFor C9H11NO2:\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\nA DoU of 5 is characteristic of a substituted benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DoU) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is too high for a simple amide but fits perfectly for the C=O stretch of an ester, particularly an aromatic ester (conjugated ester).\n\nFrom the IR data, we can deduce the presence of a primary amine (-NH2) and an ester (-COO-) group.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   `Integration (3H)`: Indicates a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   `Splitting (t, triplet)`: According to the n+1 rule, this group is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (a -CH2- group).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   `Integration (2H)`: Indicates a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   `Splitting (q, quartet)`: This group is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (a -CH3 group).\n    *   `Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm)`: This is significantly downfield, which is typical for protons on a carbon directly attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **Conclusion for these two signals:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen: **-O-CH2-CH3**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   `Integration (2H)`: Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   `Splitting (bs, broad singlet)`: Broad signals are often due to exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH groups. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the two protons of the primary amine group **(-NH2)**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   `Chemical Shift Region (7.0-8.0 ppm)`: This is the aromatic region. The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, confirming a substituted benzene ring with 4 protons.\n    *   `Splitting Pattern (two doublets)`: A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**.\n    *   `Chemical Shift Values:` The group causing the downfield shift to 8.0 ppm must be strongly electron-withdrawing (the ester group, -COOR). The group causing the upfield shift to 7.0 ppm must be electron-donating (the amine group, -NH2).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following components:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   An ethyl ester group where the ethyl is attached to the oxygen: -COOCH2CH3.\n*   A primary amine group: -NH2.\n\nPlacing these substituents at the 1 and 4 positions on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the provided options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be next to the C=O, giving a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide, not an ester, and is meta-substituted, which would produce a more complex NMR aromatic pattern.\n*   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral evidence. It is a para-substituted aromatic ring with an NH2 group and an ethyl ester group.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine and an ester.\n\nThe correct structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
