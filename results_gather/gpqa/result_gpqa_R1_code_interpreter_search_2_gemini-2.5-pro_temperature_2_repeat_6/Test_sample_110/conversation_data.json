    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reagents:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone with two different α-carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a Michael addition. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then act as a nucleophile and attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate (the nucleophile):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is quaternary, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no** α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is tertiary, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Since C6 is the only position with an α-proton on the ring, the base t-BuOK will selectively abstract the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate. The enolate will have a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate anion (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n        *   Nucleophile: The enolate of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n        *   Electrophile (Michael Acceptor): CH₂=CH-COOEt. The attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Work-up:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated (likely by t-butanol, the conjugate acid of the base) to give the final neutral product.\n\n5.  **Structure and Nomenclature of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is substituted at C2 (with ethyl and methyl) and C6 (with methyl).\n    *   The product has a new substituent, the `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt` group (an ethyl propanoate side chain), attached at C6.\n    *   So, the final product has the following key features on the cyclohexanone ring: C1=O, C2 is quaternary (Et, Me), and C6 is also quaternary (Me, CH₂CH₂COOEt).\n    *   Let's determine the IUPAC name to match the options. The options name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. This requires renumbering the ring. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon of the ring attached to the parent chain (propanoate) is numbered C1.\n        *   Let's set the point of attachment (the original C6) as the **new C1**.\n        *   The adjacent carbonyl carbon (the original C1) becomes the **new C2**.\n        *   The next carbon (the original C2) becomes the **new C3**.\n    *   Now let's place the substituents according to this new numbering:\n        *   The propanoate chain is attached at **C1**.\n        *   A **methyl group** is also on **C1** (originally on C6).\n        *   An **oxo group** (=O) is on **C2** (originally on C1).\n        *   An **ethyl group** and a **methyl group** are on **C3** (originally on C2).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of the product is therefore: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reagents:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon alpha to the nitro group (C1) are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as (E)-crotononitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, which is an excellent Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is another Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH deprotonates 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon (C1), forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n    *   Nucleophile: [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The carbanion of 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n        *   Michael acceptor: CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n        *   Attack occurs at the β-carbon, the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the 1-nitropropane and C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n\n4.  **Work-up:**\n    *   The resulting nitrile-stabilized carbanion is protonated by water (H₂O), which is present as the solvent/from the KOH solution.\n\n5.  **Structure and Nomenclature of Product B:**\n    *   The new C-C bond connects the two fragments: (CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂) and (CH₃-CH-CH₂-CN).\n    *   The resulting structure is: NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the principle functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   Numbering starts from the carbon of the nitrile group:\n        1    2      3        4        5      6\n        NC - CH₂ - CH(CH₃) - CH(NO₂) - CH₂ - CH₃\n    *   The parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   There is a **methyl group** at position **3**.\n    *   There is a **nitro group** at position **4**.\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
