    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Lab Frame (S):** This is the observer's stationary frame of reference.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass block.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the Glass (S') relative to the Lab (S):** This is given as `v`. The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the Glass Frame (S'):** This is the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest with respect to the glass. By the definition of the index of refraction `n`, this speed is `u' = c/n`. Since the problem sets `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`. This velocity is in the same direction as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the Lab Frame (S):** This is the quantity we need to find, let's call it `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:**\n    According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, when two velocities `u'` and `v` are in the same direction, the resultant velocity `u` as measured in the stationary frame is not a simple sum. The formula is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   We have `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   We have the velocity of the frame as `v`.\n    *   We are given `c = 1`.\n\n    Substituting these values into the velocity-addition formula:\n\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To remove the fractions within the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both the top and the bottom of the main fraction by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The speed of the light beam in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
