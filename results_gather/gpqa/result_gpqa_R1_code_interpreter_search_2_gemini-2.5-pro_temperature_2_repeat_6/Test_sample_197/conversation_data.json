    "Answering this question requires calculating the distribution of cobalt species in the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the species involved:**\n    In a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻), a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The species present are:\n    *   Free Co²⁺ ion (`[Co(H₂O)₆]²⁺`)\n    *   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n2.  **Use stability constants (β) to define the equilibria:**\n    The formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (β):\n    *   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺` with `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]` with `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻` with `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` with `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n3.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the individual species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n4.  **Express species concentrations in terms of `[Co²⁺]`:**\n    Using the stability constant expressions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]` (which we will denote as `L` for simplicity):\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺]L`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺]L²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺]L³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺]L⁴`\n\n5.  **Derive the mole fraction (α) for each species:**\n    The mole fraction `(α_n)` of any given species `[Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)` is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`.\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions from step 4 into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺]L + β₂[Co²⁺]L² + β₃[Co²⁺]L³ + β₄[Co²⁺]L⁴`\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺](1 + β₁L + β₂L² + β₃L³ + β₄L⁴)`\n\n    Now, let's find the formula for `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) = (β₂[Co²⁺]L²) / ([Co²⁺](1 + β₁L + β₂L² + β₃L³ + β₄L⁴))`\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out:\n    `α₂ = (β₂L²) / (1 + β₁L + β₂L² + β₃L³ + β₄L⁴)`\n\n    Note that the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage* (which is the mole fraction multiplied by 100), as it cancels out. The crucial value is the free ligand concentration, `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of α₂:**\n    We are given:\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40` (This corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex we are interested in)\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n    *   `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n\n    We will use a Python script for precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup the original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-]\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator polynomial\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * L\nterm2 = beta2 * L**2\nterm3 = beta3 * L**3\nterm4 = beta4 * L**4\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, representing the distribution function\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n\n# Restore the original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the content of the buffer\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# You can process or display the output as needed\n# For example, printing it to the console\n# print(output)\n```\npercentage=16.91618032648228\n\n\n7.  **Final Result:**\n    The calculation shows that the mole fraction `α₂` is approximately 0.16916. Converting this to a percentage gives 16.916%, which rounds to 16.9%.\n\nThis value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
