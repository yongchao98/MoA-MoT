    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Determine the structure of hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so it consists only of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. Let the formula of Z be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of H is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass)`. Using approximate atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1), this is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   We are given `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`. The value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7.\n    *   Let's assume the ratio is exactly 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n    *   We are told Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it \"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\" and is obtained from the hydrogenation of other C6 compounds (as we will see). The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's confirm: for C6H12, y=12 and x=6, so y=2x. This fits our derived formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze the hydrogenation reactions.**\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives *only* hydrocarbon Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* hydrocarbon Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This implies that all carbon-containing compounds in both mixtures X and Y are C6 compounds that can be converted to cyclohexane. This strongly suggests they all possess a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n\n3.  **Determine the components of mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component is cyclohexane.\n    *   Let the other component be Y'. The hydrogenation of Y' also yields cyclohexane.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X on a platinum catalyst. A classic example of such a reaction with C6 ring compounds is the transfer of hydrogen, leading to a more saturated compound (reduced) and a less saturated one (oxidized).\n    *   The most stable, fully \"oxidized\" (dehydrogenated) C6 ring is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Let's propose that mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (the reduced product) and benzene (the oxidized product). Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}.\n    *   Let's check if this fits the criteria for Y:\n        *   **Equimolar mixture**: The problem states this is formed.\n        *   **Two liquids**: Both cyclohexane (m.p. 6.5 °C) and benzene (m.p. 5.5 °C) are liquids at room temperature.\n        *   **Does not decolorize bromine water**: True for both cyclohexane (a saturated alkane) and benzene (which only reacts with Br2 in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with bromine water alone).\n        *   **Hydrogenation gives only Z**: Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane doesn't proceed further. So, hydrogenating the mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n    *   This hypothesis for mixture Y is very strong. Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}.\n\n4.  **Determine the properties of mixture X and the reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   The reaction `X -> Y` can be written as an overall transformation where the components of X react to form the components of Y. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane, the reaction must be:\n        `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12`\n    *   For this reaction to be stoichiometrically balanced to produce a 1:1 molar ratio of products, it must start from a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the atoms on the left side must equal the atoms on the right side.\n    *   Since X1 and X2 both hydrogenate to form cyclohexane, they must be C6 hydrocarbons, let's say C6H_y1 and C6H_y2.\n    *   So, the reaction is: `C6H_y1 + C6H_y2 --> C6H6 + C6H12`\n    *   Now, we balance the hydrogen atoms: `y1 + y2 = 6 + 12 = 18`.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules that constitute mixture X (one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2) is 18.\n    *   Let's check the remaining conditions for X.\n        *   X decolorizes bromine water: This means X1 and X2 must have double or triple bonds, so y1 and y2 must be less than 12. For example, if X1 is cyclohexene (C6H10), then y2 must be 8. X2 would be a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   No conjugated multiple bonds: If X2 is C6H8, it must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene, not the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   So, a possible composition for X is {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}. The total number of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18. This fulfills all the problem's conditions.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on our balanced reaction, this sum is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>"
