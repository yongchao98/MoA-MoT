    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators $L^2$ and $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The quantum numbers for the total angular momentum are $l=2$ and $m=-1$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and the Final State:**\n    A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n    The measurement projects the initial state onto an eigenstate of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The specific final state we are interested in is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-components add up. The total magnetic quantum number $m$ must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Compare the 'm' values of the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   For the **initial state** $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the **desired final state** $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number would be $m' = m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of finding the system in the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ after the measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the initial state and the final state:\n    $P = | \\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle |^2$\n\n    The term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n    In our case, $m = -1$ for the initial state, but for the final state we are considering, $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\n    Alternatively, one can recognize that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$. Since eigenstates of a Hermitian operator ($L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues must be orthogonal, their inner product is zero.\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nThe joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
