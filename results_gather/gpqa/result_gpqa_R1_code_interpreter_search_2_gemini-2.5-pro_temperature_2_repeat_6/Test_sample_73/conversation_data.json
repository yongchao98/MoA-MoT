    "This is a classic problem involving the principles of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential law and is a memoryless process.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Nature of Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay is a random process. The probability that an unstable nucleus will decay in a given time interval is constant and independent of its past history. This property is known as being \"memoryless\". The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its probability of decaying in the future. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to asking for the probability of a freshly prepared atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n\n2.  **Define the Decay Law:** The probability that an atom has *not* decayed after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where λ (lambda) is the decay constant.\n\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom *has* decayed within a time `t` is:\n    P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    P_decay(100) = 0.32\n\n    Using the formula from step 2:\n    0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\n    Now, we can solve for the term `e^(-λ * 100)`:\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n    While we could solve for λ itself, it's often easier to work with the `e^(-λ)` term. Let's express `e^(-λ)`:\n    (e^(-λ))^100 = 0.68\n    e^(-λ) = (0.68)^(1/100)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Desired Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As established in step 1, this is simply P_decay(150).\n    P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n    We can rewrite `e^(-λ * 150)` as `(e^(-λ))^150`. Now, substitute the expression for `e^(-λ)` from step 3:\n    P_decay(150) = 1 - [(0.68)^(1/100)]^150\n\n    Using the exponent rule `(a^b)^c = a^(b*c)`:\n    P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^(150/100)\n    P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    Now, we just need to calculate the numerical value. We can use a script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%.\n# This means the probability of survival (not decaying) in 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\np_survive_100 = 0.68\n\n# The probability of survival after time t is P(t) = e^(-lambda * t).\n# The problem asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, this is the same as the probability\n# of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150)\n\n# We know P_survive(100) = e^(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n# We need to find P_survive(150) = e^(-lambda * 150)\n\n# We can express P_survive(150) in terms of P_survive(100):\n# e^(-lambda * 150) = e^(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-lambda * 100))^1.5\n# P_survive(150) = (p_survive_100)^1.5\n\np_survive_150 = p_survive_100 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 minus the survival probability.\np_decay_150 = 1 - p_survive_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage.\nprint(f\"The probability of decay is: {p_decay_150}\")\n```\nExecution Output:\n`The probability of decay is: 0.4392949666063529`\n\nThe calculated probability is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 48%\n    *   B) 52%\n    *   C) 44%\n    *   D) 40%\n\nThe value 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay:** The fundamental principle governing radioactive decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" random process. This means the probability of a nucleus decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic properties or its probability of decaying in the next instant. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a newly created atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n2.  **Set up the Mathematical Model:** The probability that a single nucleus survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n    *   `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability that the nucleus *does* decay within a time `t` is:\n    *   `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n\n    From this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n    *   `P_survive(100) = 1 - P_decay(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n    Now, we can relate this to our formula:\n    *   `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability that the atom decays in a 150-minute interval.\n    *   `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150)`\n    *   `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    To find `e^(-λ * 150)`, we can use the value we found in step 3. Using the rules of exponents:\n    *   `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\n    Now, substitute the known value `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`:\n    *   `P_survive(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Answer:**\n    *   `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Using the value from the code execution:\n    *   `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   `P_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n    This probability, `0.4393`, is equivalent to `43.93%`.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:** The calculated value of 43.93% is closest to the given option C.\n    *   A) 48%\n    *   B) 52%\n    *   C) 44%\n    *   D) 40%\n\n<<<C>>>"
