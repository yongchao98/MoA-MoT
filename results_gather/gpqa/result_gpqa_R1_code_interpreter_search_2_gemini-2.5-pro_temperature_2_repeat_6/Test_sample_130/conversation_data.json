    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The problem describes a dienophile derived from a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic region) and two ¹³C NMR peaks (137 ppm for C=C, 165 ppm for C=O). This set of data uniquely identifies **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃). Due to symmetry, the two vinyl protons are equivalent, as are the two vinyl carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄). This is a cyclic diene with a C₅H₂ ring structure where four carbons are part of the conjugated diene system and each bears a methyl group. The fifth carbon is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. It is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. In this case, since the diene is cyclic, the product will have a bicyclic structure.\n    *   The reaction forms a **bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene** core.\n        *   The atoms C1, C2, C3, and C4 from the cyclopentadiene form part of the new framework. C1 and C4 become the bridgehead carbons, and C2-C3 becomes the double bond of the bicyclic system.\n        *   The CH₂ group (C5) from the cyclopentadiene becomes the one-carbon bridge, which is C7 in the standard nomenclature of the bicyclic product.\n        *   The two carbons from the maleic anhydride double bond form the C5-C6 bridge.\n    *   The substituents on the product skeleton are:\n        *   Methyl groups on C1, C2, C3, and C4.\n        *   Two protons and an anhydride ring fused to C5 and C6.\n        *   Two protons on C7.\n    *   The reaction yields a major and a minor product, which are stereoisomers. For Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes, these are the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction. The rule states that the electron-withdrawing groups on the dienophile (the anhydride part in this case) will preferentially be oriented \"under\" the newly forming pi-system of the diene in the transition state.\n    *   This leads to the **endo adduct as the major product**. In the endo adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the main six-membered ring as the C7 bridge. Consequently, the two protons on C5 and C6 point *away* from the C7 bridge and *towards* the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   The **exo adduct is the minor product**. In this isomer, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. The protons on C5 and C6 point *towards* the C7 bridge and *away* from the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NMR Data and Spatial Proximity (NOESY):**\n    *   The question asks about a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two nuclei (protons, in this case) are close in space (typically < 5 Å), leading to a Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE).\n    *   The key information is that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product (endo)** but **absent or weak in the minor product (exo)**. This means we are looking for two sets of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Structures:**\n\n    *   **Proton Signal Assignments (based on typical chemical shifts and the options provided):**\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Two equivalent vinylic methyl groups (on C2 and C3). They are on sp² carbons.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups (on C1 and C4). They are on sp³ carbons.\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Two equivalent protons on C5 and C6 (from the anhydride). They are adjacent to carbonyl groups. Due to the Cₛ plane of symmetry, they are equivalent and thus appear as a singlet.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This likely represents one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 bridge (the other one would be elsewhere).\n\n    *   **Let's analyze the spatial proximities for each option:**\n\n        *   **A) Bridgehead Me (~1 ppm) and Vinylic Me (~1.7 ppm):** The relative positions of the methyl groups on the C1/C4 bridgeheads and the C2/C3 double bond are identical in both the *endo* and *exo* isomers. The distance is short, so an NOE is expected in **both** products. This does not match the observation.\n\n        *   **B) C7-H (~1.5 ppm) and C5/C6-H (~3.5 ppm):**\n            *   *Major (Endo):* The C5/C6 protons point away from the C7 bridge. The distance is relatively large. A weak or absent NOE is expected.\n            *   *Minor (Exo):* The C5/C6 protons point towards the C7 bridge. The distance is short. A strong NOE is expected.\n            This is the **opposite** of the experimental observation.\n\n        *   **C) Bridgehead Me (~1 ppm) and C7-H (~1.5 ppm):** The protons on the C7 bridge are spatially close to the bridgehead methyl groups in **both** the *endo* and *exo* isomers. This interaction does not differentiate between the two.\n\n        *   **D) Vinylic Me (~1.7 ppm) and C5/C6-H (~3.5 ppm):**\n            *   ***Major (Endo) Product:*** The C5/C6 protons point towards the C2=C3 double bond. They are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups attached to C2 and C3. **A strong NOE is expected.**\n            *   ***Minor (Exo) Product:*** The C5/C6 protons point away from the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 bridge. The distance to the vinylic methyls is large. **A weak or absent NOE is expected.**\n            This scenario perfectly matches the experimental data described in the question (cross-peak present in major, absent in minor).\n\n**Conclusion:** The cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the vinylic methyl protons (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride-adjacent protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>"
