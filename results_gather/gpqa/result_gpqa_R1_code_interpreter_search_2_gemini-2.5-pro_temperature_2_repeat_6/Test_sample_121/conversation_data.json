    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Synthesis of Product 4\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat -> Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   **Reaction:** α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The α-carbon in acetic acid is the methyl carbon. One of the α-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + ethanol, H2SO4, heat -> Product 2**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n    *   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) with an acid catalyst (H2SO4).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + NaCN -> Product 3**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a source of the cyanide nucleophile (CN⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess NaH, 1,5-dibromopentane -> Product 4**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3). The two hydrogens on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic.\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon. 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br) is a dialkylating agent.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic method for forming a cyclic compound, known as the Perkin alicyclic synthesis. The reaction proceeds in several steps:\n        a.  NaH removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        b.  The enolate attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, displacing one bromide and forming a longer chain. (Intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br)\n        c.  The \"excess\" NaH then removes the second, now only, acidic α-proton.\n        d.  The resulting anion performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide and closing the ring.\n    *   The ring formed consists of the α-carbon from ethyl cyanoacetate and the five carbons from the pentyl chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nA cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n**Symmetry Analysis:**\n*   The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups:\n    1.  -CN\n    2.  -COOCH2CH3\n    3.  -CH2- group at C2 of the ring.\n    4.  -CH2- group at C6 of the ring.\n*   Because the path from C1 through C2 is different from the path through C6 (due to the presence of the other substituents), C1 is a chiral center.\n*   The molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its point group is C1.\n*   In a molecule with no symmetry, all hydrogens that cannot be interchanged by rapid bond rotation are chemically non-equivalent.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three hydrogens of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2-:** This methylene group is adjacent to the ester carbonyl, which is attached to the chiral center C1. Because of the chiral center, the two hydrogens on this methylene group are diastereotopic. Rigorously, they are chemically non-equivalent and should give **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Since the molecule is asymmetric, the chemical environments of the ring carbons C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all different.\n        *   C2 is not equivalent to C6.\n        *   C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        *   C4 is unique.\n    *   This gives 5 non-equivalent -CH2- groups.\n    *   Now consider the two geminal hydrogens on each of these -CH2- groups (e.g., on C2). Because there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the H-C-H angle, these two protons are diastereotopic. Even with rapid chair-flipping, their time-averaged environments remain different.\n    *   Therefore, each of the 5 non-equivalent -CH2- groups gives rise to 2 distinct hydrogen signals.\n    *   Total signals from the ring = 5 groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\nA strictly rigorous count gives: 1 (from -CH3) + 2 (from -OCH2-) + 10 (from the ring) = **13 signals**.\n\n**Reconciliation with Options:**\nThe number 13 is not an available option. This indicates that the question expects a simplification.\nThe two main possibilities for simplification are:\na) Assume the diastereotopic protons on the flexible ethyl -OCH2- group are accidentally equivalent, giving 1 signal.\nb) Assume that rapid chair-flipping makes the geminal diastereotopic protons on each ring -CH2- group equivalent, giving 1 signal per -CH2- group.\n\nLet's evaluate these possibilities:\n*   **Case A (Simplifying the Ethyl Group):** 1 (from -CH3) + 1 (from -OCH2-) + 10 (from the ring) = **12 signals**. This matches option C. This simplification is plausible as the chemical shift difference for diastereotopic protons on a flexible chain might be considered negligible in some contexts.\n*   **Case B (Simplifying the Ring):** 1 (from -CH3) + 2 (from -OCH2-) + 5 (from the ring) = **8 signals**. This matches option D. This simplification is common in introductory treatments of cyclohexane NMR but is technically incorrect for this asymmetric molecule.\n\nThe question explicitly asks for the number of \"chemically distinct hydrogens\" and notes that they may not be practically distinguishable. This suggests we should lean towards the more rigorous count. The discrepancy between the rigorous count of 13 and the options suggests a flawed question or a specific intended simplification. Among the choices, the simplification leading to 12 is arguably more chemically consistent than the one leading to 8, as it correctly identifies the 10 unique proton environments in the rigid ring system while only simplifying the flexible side chain.\n\nTherefore, the most probable intended answer is 12.\n\n<<<C>>>"
