    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it's adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (2 protons on the adjacent carbon, so 2+1=3 peaks, a triplet). This establishes the fragment **-CH2-CHO**.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1 proton on the adjacent carbon, so 1+1=2 peaks, a doublet). This completes the **-CH2-CHO** side chain.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively low (upfield) for aromatic protons, suggesting they are attached to an electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons, which is typical for a primary amine group (**-NH2**). The amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two substituents: an amino group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    The resulting structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**, also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (ethanal chain) + NH2 (amino group) = **C8H9NO**. This matches the given formula.\n\n    Starting Material Structure:\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/7Yf7Vq2.png)\n\n**Step 2: Follow the reaction sequence.**\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O.**\n    *   The first step (NaNO2 + HCl, typically at 0-5°C) is the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n    *   The second step (H2O, with warming) is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   This two-step sequence effectively converts the aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   Product of this stage: **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n    Intermediate Structure:\n     ![Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/BavH6t3.png)\n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n    *   We are now reacting 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a. **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        b. **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n        c. **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol *addition* product. If the reaction were carried out at a lower temperature without heat, this might be the final product (Option D).\n        Aldol Addition Product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n         \n        d. **Dehydration:** The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. The base removes the very acidic α-proton (from the carbon between the aldehyde and the new C-C bond), and the hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon leaves. This forms an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is a thermodynamically stable conjugated system.\n\n    *   **Final Product Formation (Dehydration):**\n        The aldol addition product loses a molecule of water to form the final condensed product.\n         \n\n        The resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   The starting material is 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal.\n*   Diazotization followed by hydrolysis converts it to 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n*   Treatment with base and heat initiates a self-aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration) to yield the final product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
