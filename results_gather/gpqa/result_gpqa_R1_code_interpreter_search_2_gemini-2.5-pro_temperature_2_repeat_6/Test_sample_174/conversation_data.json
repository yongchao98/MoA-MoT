    "*   **Analyze the physics of the problem:**\n    1.  The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape, symmetric about the z-axis. This system acts as an oscillating electric dipole, with its dipole moment `p` oscillating along the z-axis.\n    2.  An oscillating electric dipole is a source of electromagnetic radiation. We are interested in the radiated power in the \"radiation zone,\" which is far from the source.\n    3.  The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`d<P>/dΩ`) for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n        `d<P>/dΩ = (p₀²ω⁴)/(32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n        where:\n        *   `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment.\n        *   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n        *   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n        *   `c` is the speed of light.\n        *   `θ` is the polar angle measured from the z-axis (the axis of oscillation).\n\n*   **Determine the dependence on wavelength `λ`:**\n    1.  The problem gives the function for power per unit solid angle as `f(λ, θ)`. So, `f(λ, θ) = d<P>/dΩ`.\n    2.  The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`.\n    3.  Substituting this into the power formula:\n        `f(λ, θ) ∝ ω⁴ = (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    4.  So, a possible form for the function `f` has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence. This eliminates options A and C. We are left with B and D.\n\n*   **Determine the angular dependence and the fraction of maximum power:**\n    1.  From the formula, the angular dependence of the radiated power is `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n    2.  The maximum radiated power, denoted as `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    3.  Therefore, `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n    4.  We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n        `Power at 30° ∝ sin²(30°)`.\n    5.  We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    6.  So, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    7.  The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power:\n        `Fraction = (Power at 30°) / A = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    1.  The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    2.  A possible form of the function `f` is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n    3.  Combining these two results, we select the option that has a fraction of `1/4` and a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Let the power per unit solid angle be f(theta) = K * sin^2(theta),\n# where K is a constant that depends on lambda but not on theta.\n# f_max occurs when sin^2(theta) is maximum, i.e., sin^2(90 deg) = 1.\n# So, A = K * 1 = K.\n\n# We want to find the power at theta = 30 degrees.\ntheta_deg = 30\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n\n# The power at this angle is f(30 deg) = K * sin^2(30 deg).\npower_at_30 = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\n# The fraction of the maximum power A is f(30 deg) / A\n# Fraction = (K * sin^2(30 deg)) / K = sin^2(30 deg).\nfraction = power_at_30\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power at 30 degrees is: {fraction}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution that is spheroid in shape with the symmetry axis along the z-axis can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole with its dipole moment `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) êz` oriented along the z-axis.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`d<P>/dΩ`) by such an oscillating electric dipole is given by the Larmor formula:\n    `d<P>/dΩ = (p₀²ω⁴)/(32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n    The radiated power is therefore a function of `θ` of the form `f(θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n\n    *   The maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the equatorial plane). So, `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\n    *   We want to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. The power at this angle is proportional to `sin²(30°)`.\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio:\n    `Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    From the formula `d<P>/dΩ`, we can see the dependence on the angular frequency `ω`.\n    `d<P>/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the relation `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`.\n\n    Substituting this into the proportionality:\n    `d<P>/dΩ ∝ (c/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    So, a possible form for the function `f` has a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴`. This type of scattering is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**, and a possible form of the function `f` is proportional to **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
