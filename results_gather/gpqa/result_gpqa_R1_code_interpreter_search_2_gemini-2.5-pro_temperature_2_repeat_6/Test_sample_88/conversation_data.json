    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. Adamantane is a rigid tricyclic alkane (C10H16). 1,3-dibromoadamantane is C10H14Br2. The conditions are harsh (strong base, high temperature), suggesting a complex reaction, likely involving rearrangement, possibly with ring-opening.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **Formula:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows a total of 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 protons. This matches the number of protons in the starting material, so the reaction likely involves substitution of the two Br atoms. The IR shows a C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹, so an oxygen atom has been incorporated. The formula of Product 1 is C10H14O.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for C10H14O is (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4. Adamantane has 3 rings, so its IHD is 3. The C=O group adds one more degree of unsaturation. This means Product 1 is a saturated tricyclic ketone (3 rings + 1 C=O = IHD 4).\n    *   **Identity of P1:** The spectral data (especially the 2H signal at a very high chemical shift of 4.79 ppm) are unusual for standard adamantane derivatives. However, we must proceed by analyzing the subsequent reactions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃) and heated. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces a ketone to an alcohol.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** So, Product 2 is an alcohol, C10H16O, where the C=O of Product 1 has become a CH-OH group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with reductive workup, which specifically cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n*   **Crucial Deduction:** The fact that Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis means it *must* contain a C=C double bond.\n*   **Revisiting the Reaction Sequence:** If Product 2 (an alcohol) has a C=C bond, where did it come from?\n    *   It couldn't have come from the MPV reduction of a saturated ketone *alone*.\n    *   This implies either:\n        1.  Product 1 was an *unsaturated* ketone (an enone) from the start. This contradicts our IHD calculation for a C10H14O formula. If P1 were a tricyclic enone, its formula would be C10H12O. This indicates a likely flaw in the problem statement regarding the proton count for P1.\n        2.  The MPV reaction conditions (heating with a base, Al(OiPr)₃) caused both reduction of the ketone (P1) and a subsequent dehydration (elimination of water) to form an alkene (P2). This is a plausible pathway: `P1 (saturated tricyclic ketone) -> Intermediate alcohol -> P2 (tricyclic alkene)`.\n\n*   **Let's follow pathway (2), as it resolves the contradictions.**\n    *   We need to identify a plausible structure for P1, a saturated tricyclic ketone C10H14O, that can be formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. A known product from related reactions is **protoadamantan-4-one**. While the provided 1H NMR for P1 does not match standard spectra of this compound, let's assume it is the correct intermediate to make chemical sense of the sequence.\n    *   **P1 = Protoadamantan-4-one**.\n    *   MPV reduction of P1 gives protoadamantan-4-ol. Subsequent heating and base-catalyzed elimination would remove the -OH group and a proton from an adjacent carbon (C3 or C5) to form a double bond. Elimination of a proton from C5 is favored over elimination from the bridgehead C3.\n    *   **P2 = Protoadamant-4-ene** (Tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This is a C10H14 alkene.\n    *   Ozonolysis of P2 cleaves the C4=C5 double bond. Since this double bond is part of a ring, the cleavage opens the ring to form a single, larger molecule with two new carbonyl groups. Protoadamantene is a bicyclic system. No, it is a tricyclic system. Ozonolysis opens one of the rings.\n    *   The ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-ene yields a dicarbaldehyde derivative of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. Let's call it **P3**. Specifically, the product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,6-dicarbaldehyde** (using the new numbering of the resulting skeleton).\n    *   **P3 structure:** A bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework, which is a rigid structure resembling two fused cyclohexane chairs. It has aldehyde groups (-CHO) at positions C3 and C6.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton in Product 3**\n\n*   The most deshielded non-exchangeable (not OH) protons in P3 are the two aldehyde protons (CHO), which typically appear at δ = 9-10 ppm. The molecule is asymmetric, so one will be more deshielded than the other.\n*   Let's analyze the coupling of one of these aldehyde protons, for instance, the one at C3.\n*   The coupling pattern of a proton is determined by the number of adjacent protons (protons on neighboring atoms). This includes short-range coupling (2- or 3-bond) and, in rigid systems, can include long-range coupling (4-bond or more).\n*   **Alpha-Coupling (3-bond, H-C-C-H):** The aldehyde proton is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The adjacent (alpha) carbon is C3 of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton. This C3 is a bridgehead carbon and is a methine group (>CH). Therefore, the aldehyde proton is coupled to the single proton on C3. This coupling will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n*   **Beta-Coupling (4-bond, H-C-C-C-H):** In rigid bicyclic systems like this, long-range coupling along a \"W-shaped\" pathway is often observed. The carbons beta to the aldehyde group are C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH2-) groups. For a given rotamer of the CHO group, the aldehyde proton can be in a W-arrangement with one proton on C2 and one proton on C4. Let's assume these two beta protons give a similar coupling constant, J_beta. Coupling to these two protons will split the signal into a **triplet**.\n*   **Combined Pattern:** Combining these effects, the signal for the aldehyde proton is first split into a doublet by the alpha-proton, and each line of the doublet is further split into a triplet by the two beta-protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThis logic provides a coherent pathway from the starting material to a final product whose predicted NMR splitting matches one of the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
