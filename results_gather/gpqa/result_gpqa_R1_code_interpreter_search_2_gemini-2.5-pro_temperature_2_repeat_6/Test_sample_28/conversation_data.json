    "An analysis of the mutations is required to determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to find the most severe mutation that would halt or completely scramble the synthesis of the protein. The original gene begins with the sequence `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`, which codes for the amino acid sequence Methionine-Phenylalanine-Leucine-Alanine-Glycine...\n\nLet's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Protein: M(Met) - F(Phe) - L(Leu) - A(Ala) - G(Gly) - T(Thr)...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Change: Two substitutions have occurred.\n        1.  The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n        2.  The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid.\n    *   Effect: The resulting protein has one amino acid changed (Leu → Tyr). While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein will be full-length.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Effect: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will begin, produce Methionine and Phenylalanine, and then terminate prematurely. The resulting product is just a two-amino-acid dipeptide instead of a full protein. This will almost certainly eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...`\n    *   Comparison: The sequence for Mutant 3 is 48 nucleotides long, while the intact sequence is 47. This one-nucleotide difference indicates an **insertion**, which causes a **frameshift mutation**. The reading frame of the gene is shifted, causing all subsequent codons to be misread. This scrambles the entire amino acid sequence from the point of the insertion onward and usually leads to a premature stop codon being created in the new, incorrect reading frame. This type of mutation is also very likely to eliminate protein function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...`\n    *   Comparison: The sequence for Mutant 4 is 44 nucleotides long, a deletion of 3 bases compared to the intact 47-nucleotide sequence. A deletion of a multiple of three bases is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one or more amino acids but preserves the reading frame for the rest of the protein. In this case, the `GGT` codon (Glycine) is deleted, and a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) also occurred.\n    *   Effect: The final protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another changed (Leu → Tyr). Like a missense mutation, this may or may not eliminate function, but it is less certain than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth nonsense mutations (Mutant 2) and frameshift mutations (Mutant 3) are catastrophic and are the most probable types of mutations to eliminate the function of a gene. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein (the 3rd codon). This results in an extremely truncated, guaranteed non-functional dipeptide. It is the clearest and most definitive knockout among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
