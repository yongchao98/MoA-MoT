    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Structure:** The name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is the IUPAC name for cyclohexene oxide. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused to it. The IUPAC numbering treats the oxygen as atom 7, bridging carbons 1 and 6. This implies C1 and C6 are adjacent carbons on the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The configuration is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We need to determine the spatial arrangement of all groups. Let's assume a planar representation of the cyclohexane ring for easier visualization of stereochemistry and draw the epoxide oxygen as being on the top face (beta, β).\n\n    *   **At C1:** This carbon has a methyl group. It is connected to O(7), C6, C2, and Me.\n        *   Priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog): O > C6 > C2 > Me. (C6 is higher priority than C2 because C6 is bonded to O, while C2 is not).\n        *   The configuration is **(1R)**. With the lowest priority group (Me) pointing away (down, α), the path from priority 1 (O) → 2 (C6) → 3 (C2) must be clockwise. If we place the Me group down (alpha, α), and look from the Me towards C1, the O atom is up, C6 is to the left, and C2 is to the right. The path O→C6→C2 is counter-clockwise (S). To get R, the Me group must be up (beta, β). However, let's re-verify the priority C6 vs C2 from C1. C6 is attached to (O,C5,H). C2 is attached to (C3(with Me),H,H). C3 is C(C,C,H) while C5 is C(C,H,H). So C3>C5. C2 might be higher priority than C6. Let's re-evaluate. From C1: path to C2 -> C3(Me), path to C6 -> C5. From C3, you go to C4(Me). From C5 you go to C4(Me). This is complex. Let's use a standard convention.\n        Let's try again with planar representation, C1 top-right, C6 top-left. Epoxide (O) is `up` (β, wedged).\n        Priorities at C1: O(1) > C6(2) > C2(3) > Me(4). [This priority is based on O > C and for C6 vs C2, C6 is bonded to O, C2 is not]. To get **1R**, if we place Me `down` (α, dashed), looking from Me→C1, the order O→C6→C2 is clockwise. This gives R. So, **C1-Me is α (down)**.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen. It's connected to O(7), C1, C5, and H.\n        *   Priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H. (C1 has a methyl and is bonded to O, C5 is a CH2 bonded to C4(Me)).\n        *   The configuration is **(6S)**. With H (lowest priority) pointing away (down, α), the path O→C1→C5 must be counter-clockwise. Let's place H `down` (α). Looking from H→C6, O is up, C1 is right, C5 is left. The path O→C1→C5 is counter-clockwise. This gives S. So, **C6-H is α (down)**.\n    *   **At C3:** This carbon has a methyl group. It's connected to C2, C4, Me, and H.\n        *   Priorities: C2 > C4 > Me > H. (C2 is closer to C1 with O/Me, C4 is closer to C5/C6).\n        *   The configuration is **(3R)**. If H is `down` (α), the path C2→C4→Me must be clockwise. This configuration would mean Me is up (β). Let's check: H down, Me up. Viewing H->C3: path C2->C4->Me is clockwise, R. Wait, C2 is left, C4 is right, Me is up. Path is C2->C4->Me, counter-clockwise (S). So H must be `up` (β) and **Me must be `down` (α)**. Then viewing from H->C3 gives a clockwise R configuration.\n    *   **At C4:** This carbon has a methyl group. It's connected to C3, C5, Me, and H.\n        *   Priorities: C3 > C5 > Me > H. (C3 has a Me group, C5 is adjacent to C6 with O). Let's assume this for now.\n        *   The configuration is **(4R)**. If H is `down` (α), Me must be `up` (β) for a clockwise path C3→C5→Me. This works. So, **C4-Me is β (up)**.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Stereochemistry:**\n*   Epoxide Oxygen: **β (up)**\n*   C1-Methyl: **α (down)**\n*   C6-Hydrogen: **α (down)**\n*   C3-Methyl: **α (down)**\n*   C4-Methyl: **β (up)**\n\n### **2. The Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate (a Gilman reagent).\n*   **Reaction:** Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles that open epoxides via an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The question states, \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   C1 of the epoxide is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 of the epoxide is substituted with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from the cuprate will attack **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 attack. This means:\n    1.  The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. Since the epoxide is β (up), the methyl group attacks from the **α-face (down)**.\n    2.  This attack causes an **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon (C6).\n    3.  The C1-O bond breaks and, after workup, forms an alcohol (-OH). The stereochemistry at C1 is retained because no bonds to the chiral center are broken. The C1-O bond was β (up), so the resulting OH group will be **β (up)**.\n\n### **3. The Product**\n\nLet's determine the structure and stereochemistry of the product. We will first track the substituents using the old numbering.\n\n*   **At C1:** The α-methyl group is unchanged. The β-epoxide bond becomes a **β-OH group**.\n*   **At C6:** It originally had an H atom in the α position. The incoming methyl group attacks from the α side, so the **new methyl group is α (down)**. The original **H atom is pushed to the β position (up)**. The configuration inverts from S to R.\n*   **At C3 and C4:** These centers are not involved in the reaction, so their stereochemistry is retained. C3-Me remains α (down), and C4-Me remains β (up).\n\n### **4. IUPAC Naming of the Product**\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent:** The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. The principal functional group is the -OH, so that carbon is C1.\n2.  **Numbering:** The carbon bearing the OH is C1 (the \"old\" C1). We need to number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   We have methyls at \"old\" positions C1, C3, C4, and now C6.\n    *   If we number clockwise from new C1 (old C1), we have methyls at 1, 3, 4, and 6.\n    *   If we number counter-clockwise from new C1 (old C1 -> old C6 -> old C5...), the methyls are at new C1 (old C1), new C2 (old C6), new C4 (old C4), and new C5 (old C3). The locants are **1, 2, 4, 5**. This set is lower than (1,3,4,6).\n3.  **Name:** The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n4.  **Determine Absolute Configuration (R/S) for the new numbering:**\n    *   **New C1 (old C1):** OH(β), Me(α). Neighbors: C2(old C6, with a new Me) and C6(old C2, CH₂). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. The lowest priority Me is α (down, away). Viewing from the bottom, the path 1(OH)→2(C2)→3(C6) is **clockwise**. Thus, **C1 is R**.\n    *   **New C2 (old C6):** Me(α), H(β). Neighbors: C1(with OH) and C3(CH₂). Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. The lowest priority H is β (up, towards viewer). The path 1(C1)→2(C3)→3(Me) is **counter-clockwise**. Because H is pointing up, we reverse the result. CCW → R. Thus, **C2 is R**.\n    *   **New C4 (old C4):** Me(β), H(α). Neighbors: C3(CH₂) and C5(old C3, with Me). Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. The lowest priority H is α (down, away). The path 1(C5)→2(C3)→3(Me) is **clockwise**. Thus, **C4 is R**.\n    *   **New C5 (old C3):** Me(α), H(β). Neighbors: C4(with Me) and C6(CH₂). Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. The lowest priority H is β (up, towards viewer). The path 1(C4)→2(C6)→3(Me) is **counter-clockwise**. Because H is pointing up, CCW → R. Thus, **C5 is R**.\n\nThe final product has the configuration **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the name and stereochemistry, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
