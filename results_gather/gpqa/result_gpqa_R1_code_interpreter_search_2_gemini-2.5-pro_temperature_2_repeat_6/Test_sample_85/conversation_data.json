    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products**\n\nBoth reactions produce a chiral lactone (a cyclic ester) called `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom within the ring and a carbonyl group (C=O). The numbering places the ring oxygen at position 1 and the carbonyl carbon at position 2. An ethyl group is attached to position 4.\n*   **Chirality:** The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups (H, ethyl group, -CH2-C=O, and -CH2-O-).\n*   **Reaction 1 Product:** `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reaction 2 Product:** `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided suggest that the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   **Structure:** This is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid). It has an ethyl group at C3, a free carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end, and an isobutyl ester group (-COOCH2CH(CH3)2) at the other end.\n*   **Full Structure:** `(CH3)2CHCH2-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Chirality:** The carbon at position 3 (the one with the ethyl group) is a chiral center. This is the same carbon atom that becomes the chiral center (C4) in the final lactone product.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to this problem is understanding the selectivity of the two different reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`.\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH4 + H+**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** `LiBH4` (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally too weak to reduce carboxylic acids.\n2.  **Reaction:** `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group `(-COOiBu)` to a primary alcohol `(-CH2OH)`. The carboxylic acid group `(-COOH)` will remain unchanged.\n    *   `...-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` (acid part) --- `LiBH4` ---> No reaction\n    *   `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH2-...` (ester part) --- `LiBH4` ---> `HO-CH2-CH2-...` (alcohol part)\n3.  **Intermediate:** The intermediate formed is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid: `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\n4.  **Cyclization:** In the presence of acid (`H+`), the hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid group in an intramolecular esterification (a process called lactonization) to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. If the product is the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must have been the `(R)`-enantiomer.\n    *   **(R)-Starting Material A** ---> **(R)-Product**\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH3 + H+**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** `BH3` (Borane) is a powerful reducing agent with a unique preference for carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n2.  **Reaction:** `BH3` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group `(-COOH)` to a primary alcohol `(-CH2OH)`. The isobutyl ester group `(-COOiBu)` will remain unchanged.\n    *   `...-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` (acid part) --- `BH3` ---> `...-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (alcohol part)\n    *   `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH2-...` (ester part) --- `BH3` ---> No reaction\n3.  **Intermediate:** The intermediate formed is a 5-hydroxy ester: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`.\n4.  **Cyclization:** With acid catalysis (`H+`), the hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl group in an intramolecular transesterification reaction. This displaces the isobutanol (`iBuOH`) and forms the same six-membered lactone ring.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chemical transformations do not involve the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of starting material B is retained in the product. If the product is the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must have been the `(S)`-enantiomer.\n    *   **(S)-Starting Material B** ---> **(S)-Product**\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\n*   To get the `(R)` product, starting material **A** must be **`(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`**.\n*   To get the `(S)` product, starting material **B** must be **`(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
