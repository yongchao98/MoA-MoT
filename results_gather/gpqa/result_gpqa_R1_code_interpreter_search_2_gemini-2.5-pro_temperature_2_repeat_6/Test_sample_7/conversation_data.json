As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "This problem requires analyzing genetic interactions based on the phenotypes of single and double mutants. Let's break down the analysis step by step.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Role of G2\n\n*   **Single mutant g2:** Resistance is 0%. This means G2 is absolutely Fg for the resistance pathway. Knocking it out completely eliminates resistance.\n*   **Double mutants g1g2 and g2g3:** Resistance is also 0% for both.\n*   **Epistasis:** When a double mutant (e.g., g1g2) shows the same phenotype as one of the single mutants (e.g., g2), the gene from the single mutant (G2) is said to be **epistatic** to the other gene (G1). In this case, the `g2` mutation masks the phenotype of the `g1` mutation (which would have been 75% resistance) and the `g3` mutation (which would have been 50% resistance).\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the `g2` phenotype (0% resistance) is dominant in the double mutants, G2 must act upstream of both G1 and G3. Given the information that at least one gene is a transcription factor, G2 is the strongest candidate. It likely acts as a master switch that activates the expression of G1 and G3.\n\nThis finding allows us to eliminate **Option D**, which incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Interaction between G1 and G3\n\nNow we look at the relationship between G1 and G3, which are downstream of G2.\n`Pathway so far: G2 -> (G1, G3) -> Resistance`\n\n*   **Single mutants:** `g1` has 75% resistance (a loss of 25%), and `g3` has 50% resistance (a loss of 50%). They both contribute to resistance, but to different extents.\n*   **Double mutant g1g3:** Resistance is 10%.\n*   **Expected vs. Observed Phenotype:** If G1 and G3 acted in completely independent pathways, the expected resistance might be an additive effect of their losses. The loss from `g1` is 25%, and from `g3` is 50%. An additive loss would be 75%, resulting in 25% resistance.\n*   **Synergistic Interaction:** The observed resistance (10%) is much lower than the expected additive effect (25%). This means the combined loss of both genes is much greater than the sum of their individual losses. This type of interaction, where the double mutant has a more severe phenotype than expected, is known as a **synergistic interaction**. In genetics, this is a classic sign of **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform partially overlapping functions. The system can compensate somewhat for the loss of one, but the loss of both is catastrophic.\n\nThis finding points us toward options that describe the G1-G3 interaction as redundancy.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Remaining Options\n\nWe have concluded that **G2 is a transcription factor** and that **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**. Let's review the remaining options (A, B, C):\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct.\n    *   `Same promoter`: Plausible if they are co-regulated by G2, but \"gene redundancy\" is a better functional description of the observed data.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: This is incorrect. If G3 were epistatic, the `g1g3` phenotype would be the same as the `g3` phenotype (50% resistance), which it is not (it's 10%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. This is the best description of the synergistic effect observed in the `g1g3` mutant.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This is incorrect. If G1 were epistatic, the `g1g3` phenotype would be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75% resistance), which it is not.\n    *   Despite the incorrect epistasis statement, this option contains two correct conclusions that are strongly supported by the data.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct.\n    *   `Pleiotropy`: This term is incorrect here. Pleiotropy describes a single gene affecting multiple different traits. This experiment shows multiple genes (G1, G3) interacting to affect a single trait (disease resistance).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, **Option B** is the best fit. It correctly identifies G2 as the upstream transcription factor and correctly describes the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The final clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 is inconsistent with the data, likely an error in the question's construction, but the other two statements in this option are the most accurate description of the experimental results.\n\n<<<B>>>"
