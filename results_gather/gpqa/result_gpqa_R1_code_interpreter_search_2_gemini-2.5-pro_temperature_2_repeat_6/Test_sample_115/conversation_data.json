    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A:**\n    *   The proton NMR spectrum of compound A shows two signals.\n    *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H indicates two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). The (n+1) rule gives 2+1=3 (a triplet).\n    *   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H indicates two equivalent methylene groups (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The (n+1) rule gives 3+1=4 (a quartet).\n    *   This pattern (a 3H triplet and a 2H quartet) is characteristic of an ethyl group (CH3-CH2-). Since we have 6H and 4H, this indicates two equivalent ethyl groups.\n    *   For the two ethyl groups to be equivalent and result in only two NMR signals, the molecule must be symmetrical. The structure CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3 (n-butane) fits this description perfectly. The two outer CH3 groups are equivalent, and the two inner CH2 groups are equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, **Compound A is n-butane**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound B:**\n    *   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form B. The bromination of an alkane typically substitutes a hydrogen atom with a bromine atom.\n    *   n-Butane has primary (C1, C4) and secondary (C2, C3) hydrogens. Halogenation is selective, favoring the substitution of secondary hydrogens over primary ones because the resulting secondary radical intermediate is more stable.\n    *   Therefore, the major product will be 2-bromobutane.\n    *   **Compound B is 2-bromobutane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound C:**\n    *   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a classic dehydrohalogenation (E2) reaction to form an alkene.\n    *   Elimination can occur via two pathways, removing a hydrogen from either C1 or C3.\n    *   According to Zaitsev's rule, the major product is the more substituted (and therefore more stable) alkene.\n        *   Removal of H from C1 gives but-1-ene (monosubstituted alkene).\n        *   Removal of H from C3 gives but-2-ene (disubstituted alkene).\n    *   Thus, the major product is but-2-ene. The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers, which is true for but-2-ene (cis-but-2-ene and trans-but-2-ene).\n    *   **Compound C is but-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound D:**\n    *   Compound D is formed from the reaction of the *cis-isomer of C* (cis-but-2-ene) with *(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol*. This is a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **The Dienophile:** cis-but-2-ene.\n    *   **The Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. Let's determine its structure. The IUPAC name indicates a 5-carbon chain (penta), with double bonds starting at C1 and C3, and an alcohol group at C1. The structure is **HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH3**. The (1E,3E) designation specifies the stereochemistry at both double bonds is E (trans).\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative). The product will be **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a 4,6,6-trimethyl substitution pattern. The choice is between B and C.\n\n5.  **Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder Reaction:**\n    The relative stereochemistry of the product is determined by specific rules:\n    *   **Rule 1 (from the dienophile):** The stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained. Since we start with *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (which will be on C5 and C6 of the product) must be **cis** to each other.\n    *   **Rule 2 (from the diene):** The stereochemistry of the diene is also retained. For an (E,E)-diene, the two \"outward-pointing\" substituents on the termini of the conjugated system (C1 and C4) end up **cis** to each other in the product. Here, the substituents are the -OH group on C1 and the -CH3 group on C4. Thus, the C1-OH and C4-CH3 groups must be **cis**.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Options:**\n    We need to find the option where both (C1-OH and C4-CH3) and (C5-CH3 and C6-CH3) are cis. We can use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) descriptors to determine the relative stereochemistry (cis/trans). For the relationships in this cyclohexene ring system:\n    *   A *cis* relationship corresponds to opposite stereochemical descriptors (R,S or S,R).\n    *   A *trans* relationship corresponds to the same stereochemical descriptors (R,R or S,S).\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    *   **B) (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**\n        *   C1(S) and C4(R): Opposite descriptors -> **cis**. (This matches Rule 2)\n        *   C5(S) and C6(S): Same descriptors -> **trans**. (This violates Rule 1)\n        *   Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**\n        *   C1(S) and C4(R): Opposite descriptors -> **cis**. (This matches Rule 2)\n        *   C5(S) and C6(R): Opposite descriptors -> **cis**. (This matches Rule 1)\n        *   Therefore, option C is correct as it satisfies both stereochemical requirements of the reaction.\n\nFinal conclusion: Compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
