    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the nature of the interstellar medium being observed.\n\n**1. Understand the cosmological redshift effect:**\nThe observation is of a structure located at a very large distance (2.1 Gpc). Due to the expansion of the universe, light from such a distant object is stretched, and its wavelength increases. This phenomenon is called cosmological redshift. An increase in wavelength corresponds to a decrease in the energy of the photons. The observed energy (E_obs) is related to the energy emitted at the source (the rest-frame energy, E_rest) by the formula:\n\nE_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)\n\nwhere 'z' is the redshift.\n\n**2. Calculate the redshift (z):**\nWe can estimate the redshift from the distance using the Hubble-Lemaître law, which relates the recessional velocity (v) of a galaxy to its distance (d):\n\nv = H₀ * d\n\nwhere H₀ is the Hubble constant. For velocities that are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c), the redshift is given by z ≈ v/c.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc.\n*   **Hubble Constant (H₀):** A commonly accepted value is approximately 70 km/s/Mpc.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** Approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\nFirst, calculate the recessional velocity:\nv = 70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s\n\nNow, calculate the redshift:\nz = v / c = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49\n\n**3. Calculate the rest-frame energy (E_rest):**\nUsing the observed energy (E_obs = 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) and the calculated redshift (z = 0.49), we can find the energy of the absorption line in its own reference frame (i.e., in the Milky Way, as the question asks for the equivalent observation).\n\nE_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49)\nE_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * 1.49\nE_rest ≈ 5.811 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\n**4. Identify the corresponding astrophysical transition:**\nNow we need to identify which transition in the interstellar medium (ISM) corresponds to an energy of approximately 5.8 x 10⁻⁶ eV. Let's examine the famous 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen.\n\n*   The 21 cm line results from the hyperfine transition of the electron in a neutral hydrogen atom (H I).\n*   Its rest frequency (ν) is 1420.40575 MHz = 1.4204 * 10⁹ Hz.\n*   We can find its energy using the Planck-Einstein relation, E = hν, where h is Planck's constant (h ≈ 4.1357 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s).\n\nE_21cm = (4.1357 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s) * (1.4204 * 10⁹ s⁻¹)\nE_21cm ≈ 5.874 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\nThe calculated rest-frame energy (5.811 * 10⁻⁶ eV) is an excellent match for the energy of the 21 cm hydrogen line (5.874 * 10⁻⁶ eV). The small discrepancy is due to the precise value of the Hubble constant used and the approximation in the redshift formula.\n\nTo verify this calculation, the following python script is used.\n```python\n# Constants\nH0 = 70  # Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc\nc = 3e5  # Speed of light in km/s\nd_gpc = 2.1  # Distance in Gigaparsecs\nE_obs_ev = 3.9e-6  # Observed energy in eV\n\nh_ev_s = 4.1357e-15 # Planck constant in eV*s\nnu_21cm = 1420.40575e6 # Frequency of 21cm line in Hz\n\n# 1. Convert distance to Mpc\nd_mpc = d_gpc * 1000\n\n# 2. Calculate redshift (z)\n# v = H0 * d\nv = H0 * d_mpc\n# z = v / c\nz = v / c\n\n# 3. Calculate rest-frame energy (E_rest)\n# E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)\nE_rest_ev = E_obs_ev * (1 + z)\n\n# 4. Calculate the energy of the 21cm line\nE_21cm_ev = h_ev_s * nu_21cm\n\n# Print the results for comparison\nprint(f\"Calculated Redshift (z): {z:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Rest-Frame Energy: {E_rest_ev * 1e6:.4f} micro-electron volts (µeV)\")\nprint(f\"Energy of 21cm Hydrogen Line: {E_21cm_ev * 1e6:.4f} micro-electron volts (µeV)\")\n\n```\n>>>\nCalculated Redshift (z): 0.4900\nCalculated Rest-Frame Energy: 5.8110 micro-electron volts (µeV)\nEnergy of 21cm Hydrogen Line: 5.8743 micro-electron volts (µeV)\n>>>\n**5. Relate the transition to the ISM component:**\nThe 21 cm line is a spectral line of neutral **atomic** hydrogen. This eliminates options A and B, which refer to molecular media. We are left with two options:\n*   C) Warm atomic interstellar medium (WNM).\n*   D) Cold atomic interstellar medium (CNM).\n\nBoth the WNM and CNM are composed of neutral atomic hydrogen. However, absorption lines are most prominent when the gas is cold. The strength of a 21 cm absorption line is inversely proportional to the temperature of the gas. Therefore, the **cold** atomic medium (CNM), with temperatures around 50-100 K, produces much stronger and more easily detectable absorption features than the warm atomic medium (WNM), which has temperatures of thousands of Kelvin.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAn absorption line with a rest-frame energy corresponding to the 21 cm transition is a key tracer of neutral atomic hydrogen. Such absorption features are most characteristically produced by the Cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<D>>>",
