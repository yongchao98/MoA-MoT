This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the relative populations of atomic energy levels.\n\n2.  **Write the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states, `j` (higher energy) and `i` (lower energy):\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `E_j` and `E_i` are the energies of the states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to each star:**\n    *   For star_1 with temperature T_1:\n        (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2 with temperature T_2:\n        (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the Boltzmann equations from step 3 into the relationship from step 4:\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both sides since we are considering the same transition in the same type of atom (iron). We can cancel it out:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to get ln(2) on one side:\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n9.  **Factor and combine terms:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k` and find a common denominator for the temperature terms:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n10. **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Let's calculate the pre-factor:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n    Note that the problem is cleverly designed so this factor simplifies to 1.\n\n11. **Final Equation:** Substitute this value back into the equation from step 9:\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n12. **Compare with the options:** This final equation matches option B.\n\nA) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nB) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nC) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\nD) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n\nThe correct equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the Boltzmann equation, which is appropriate given the assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels (a higher state `j` and a lower state `i`):\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j` and `N_i` are the populations of the energy levels `j` and `i`.\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's define the ratio of populations (the \"excitation\") as `R = N_j / N_i`. We can write the equation for each star:\n\n1.  **For star 1 (temperature T_1):**\n    R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n2.  **For star 2 (temperature T_2):**\n    R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2, so `R_1 = 2 * R_2`.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for R_1 and R_2:\n\n(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights `(g_j / g_i)` is a property of the iron atom and cancels out from both sides:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\nΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The value of the Boltzmann constant `k` is also `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation:\n\n1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_j`) to a lower state (`N_i`) is given by:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `g` represents the statistical weights of the levels, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars:** We can write this equation for each star:\n    *   Star 1: `(N_j / N_i)_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   Star 2: `(N_j / N_i)_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n    (Here, `C` is the constant ratio of statistical weights `g_j / g_i`).\n\n3.  **Using the Problem's Condition:** We are told that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This means:\n    `(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2`\n\n4.  **Combining the Equations:**\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n    The constant `C` cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n5.  **Solving for Temperature:** To solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    Using logarithm rules, this simplifies to:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n    Rearranging the terms to solve for `ln(2)`:\n    `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ((T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Using the Given Values:** The problem provides `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`. This means the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1.\n\n7.  **Final Result:** Substituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1` into our equation gives the final relationship:\n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n    This matches option D.\n\nThe following Python code will print the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks to identify the correct equation relating the temperatures\n# of two stars, T_1 and T_2, based on the excitation of iron atoms.\n\n# Step 1: Define the relationship from the problem statement.\n# The excitation ratio in star 1 is twice that in star 2.\n# Let R be the excitation ratio (N_excited / N_lower_state).\n# R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n# Step 2: Use the Boltzmann equation for the excitation ratio R.\n# R = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T)), where C is a constant (g_j/g_i).\n# For star 1: R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n# For star 2: R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n# Step 3: Substitute the Boltzmann equations into the relationship from Step 1.\n# C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n# The constant C cancels out.\n# exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n# Step 4: Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2 by taking the natural log.\n# ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))\n# -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))\n# -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n# Step 5: Rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2).\n# ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n# ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n# ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n\n# Step 6: Use the given physical constants.\n# ΔE is given as approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.\n# The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n# Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n\n# Step 7: Substitute this value into the equation.\n# ln(2) = 1 * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n# ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n# Step 8: Compare this result with the given options.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\",\n    \"B\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\",\n    \"C\": \"ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\",\n    \"D\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\"\n}\n\n# The derived equation matches option D.\ncorrect_option = \"D\"\n\nprint(\"The derivation leads to the equation: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"The correct choice is: {options[correct_option]}\")\nprint(\"<<<D>>>\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The derivation leads to the equation: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\nThis corresponds to option D.\nThe correct choice is: ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n<<<D>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the governing physical principle.**\nThe problem describes the population of atoms in different energy levels within the photospheres of stars. It explicitly mentions the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This situation is described by the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of two energy levels to the temperature of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Write down the Boltzmann Equation.**\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (level 1):\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the excited and lower states, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The problem does not provide the statistical weights (g₁ and g₂). In such cases, it is standard to assume that their ratio (g₂/g₁) is 1, or that it is the same for both stars and thus cancels out in the comparison. We will proceed with the assumption that g₂/g₁ = 1.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star.**\nLet R be the ratio of the population in the excited state to the population in the lower state (R = N₂/N₁).\n*   For star_1 with temperature T₁:\n    R₁ = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n*   For star_2 with temperature T₂:\n    R₂ = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n**Step 4: Use the relationship given in the problem.**\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means the ratio of populations for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2.\nR₁ = 2 * R₂\nSubstituting the expressions from Step 3:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n**Step 5: Solve the equation for the relationship between T₁ and T₂.**\nTo solve this exponential equation, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\nUsing the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(eˣ) = x:\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate the ln(2) term:\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T₂) - (1 / T₁) ]\n\nFind a common denominator for the terms in the brackets:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ / (T₁*T₂)) - (T₂ / (T₁*T₂)) ]\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The derived equation contains the term (ΔE / k). The options provided do not have this term. This implies that the value of this term must be 1. We must check this using the values given in the problem.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the value of the (ΔE / k) term.**\nThe problem gives:\n*   Energy difference, ΔE = 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nCalculate the ratio:\n(ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nThe numerical value of the pre-factor is exactly 1.\n\n**Step 7: Substitute the value back into the equation.**\nSubstitute (ΔE / k) = 1 into the equation from Step 5:\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\nln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n**Step 8: Compare the final result with the given options.**\nThe derived equation is ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]. This matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the population of different energy levels and temperature is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `i` (`N_i`) is given by:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(- (E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n    Where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Interpret the problem statement:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the population in the lower state (`N_j / N_i`) is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n    Let `R(T) = N_j / N_i` be the excitation ratio at a given temperature `T`.\n    The problem gives us:\n    `R(T_1) = 2 * R(T_2)`\n    Where `T_1` is the temperature of star_1 and `T_2` is the temperature of star_2.\n\n4.  **Set up the equation using the Boltzmann formula:**\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both stars and cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    `ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n7.  **Rearrange the equation:** We want to find an expression for `ln(2)`, so we rearrange the terms:\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n8.  **Factor and simplify the expression:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n9.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem states that the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately `1.38 x 10^-23 J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K`.\n    Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^-23 J) / (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n    So, the constant of proportionality `(ΔE / k)` is approximately `1 K`.\n\n10. **Final form of the equation:** Substituting this value back into our derived equation gives:\n    `ln(2) ≈ (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n    B) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]`\n    C) `ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]`\n    D) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n\n    Our derived relationship has the functional form `(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`. This matches option D. Although the equation in option D is dimensionally inconsistent (a dimensionless number `ln(2)` is equated to a term with units of `1/Temperature`), it is the only option that correctly represents the physical relationship derived from the Boltzmann equation. It is likely that the constant factor `ΔE/k ≈ 1 K` was omitted for simplicity in the problem's options.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reasoning behind the derivation is sound and confirmed by the search results.

Understand the Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states. For an excited state 'j' and a lower energy state 'i', the ratio of their populations (N_j / N_i) at a temperature T is given by:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   N_j, N_i are the number of atoms in states j and i, respectively.\n*   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   E_j - E_i = ΔE is the energy difference between the two states.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe term (N_j / N_i) represents the \"excitation\" of the atoms to the level j relative to level i.\n\n**2.

This situation is described by the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of two energy levels to the temperature of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Write down the Boltzmann Equation.**\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (level 1):\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the excited and lower states, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The problem does not provide the statistical weights (g₁ and g₂). In such cases, it is standard to assume that their ratio (g₂/g₁) is 1, or that it is the same for both stars and thus cancels out in the comparison. We will proceed with the assumption that g₂/g₁ = 1.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star.**\nLet R be the ratio of the population in the excited state to the population in the lower state (R = N₂/N₁).\n*   For star_1 with temperature T₁:\n    R₁ = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n*   For star_2 with temperature T₂:\n    R₂ = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n**Step 4: Use the relationship given in the problem.**\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means the ratio of populations for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2.\nR₁ = 2 * R₂\nSubstituting the expressions from Step 3:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n**Step 5: Solve the equation for the relationship between T₁ and T₂.**\nTo solve this exponential equation, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\nUsing the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(eˣ) = x:\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate the ln(2) term:\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T₂) - (1 / T₁) ]\n\nFind a common denominator for the terms in the brackets:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ / (T₁*T₂)) - (T₂ / (T₁*T₂)) ]\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The derived equation contains the term (ΔE / k).

The relationship between the population of different energy levels and temperature is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `i` (`N_i`) is given by:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(- (E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n    Where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Interpret the problem statement:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the population in the lower state (`N_j / N_i`) is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n    Let `R(T) = N_j / N_i` be the excitation ratio at a given temperature `T`.\n    The problem gives us:\n    `R(T_1) = 2 * R(T_2)`\n    Where `T_1` is the temperature of star_1 and `T_2` is the temperature of star_2.\n\n4.  **Set up the equation using the Boltzmann formula:**\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both stars and cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    `ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n7.  **Rearrange the equation:** We want to find an expression for `ln(2)`, so we rearrange the terms:\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n8.  **Factor and simplify the expression:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n9.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem states that the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately `1.38 x 10^-23 J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K`.\n    Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^-23 J) / (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n    So, the constant of proportionality `(ΔE / k)` is approximately `1 K`.\n\n10. **Final form of the equation:** Substituting this value back into our derived equation gives:\n    `ln(2) ≈ (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n    B) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]`\n    C) `ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]`\n    D) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n\n    Our derived relationship has the functional form `(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`. This matches option D. Although the equation in option D is dimensionally inconsistent (a dimensionless number `ln(2)` is equated to a term with units of `1/Temperature`), it is the only option that correctly represents the physical relationship derived from the Boltzmann equation. It is likely that the constant factor `ΔE/k ≈ 1 K` was omitted for simplicity in the problem's options.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reasoning behind the derivation is sound and confirmed by the search results.

Understand the Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states. For an excited state 'j' and a lower energy state 'i', the ratio of their populations (N_j / N_i) at a temperature T is given by:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   N_j, N_i are the number of atoms in states j and i, respectively.\n*   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   E_j - E_i = ΔE is the energy difference between the two states.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe term (N_j / N_i) represents the \"excitation\" of the atoms to the level j relative to level i.\n\n**2.

The relationship between the population of different energy levels and temperature is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (`N`) in two different energy states, say state `i` (an excited state) and state `j` (a lower state, e.g., the ground state), as:\n    `N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g_i` and `g_j` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_i - E_j` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Interpret the problem statement:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population of the excited state to the lower state (`N_i / N_j`) is twice as large in star 1 as it is in star 2. Let's call this ratio `R`.\n    *   For star 1 (temperature `T_1`): `R_1 = N_i,1 / N_j,1 = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   For star 2 (temperature `T_2`): `R_2 = N_i,2 / N_j,2 = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    The condition given is `R_1 = 2 * R_2`.\n\n4.  **Set up the equation:** Substitute the expressions for `R_1` and `R_2` into the condition `R_1 = 2 * R_2`:\n    `(g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, `(g_i / g_j)`, is a constant for the specific energy levels of the iron atom and thus cancels out from both sides:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    To solve for the temperatures, we can rearrange the equation by dividing both sides by `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2`\n\n    Using the exponential rule `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n    `exp( [-ΔE / (k * T_1)] - [-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ) = 2`\n    `exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) + ΔE / (k * T_2) ) = 2`\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ) = 2`\n\n6.  **Isolate the temperature term:** Take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    `1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n    Substitute this back into the equation:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n7.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem states that the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    Let's compute the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n    The problem is designed such that this pre-factor simplifies to 1.\n\n8.  **Final Result:** Substitute this value back into the equation:\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\nThis equation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe problem describes the relative excitation of iron atoms in two different stars, star_1 and star_2, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to relate the population of energy levels to the temperature.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (`N_i`) in an excited energy level `i` to the number of atoms (`N_j`) in a lower energy level `j`:\n\n`N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T)]`\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_i` and `g_j` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   `E_i - E_j` is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Applying the Equation to Both Stars**\n\nLet's write the Boltzmann equation for the specific energy levels in each star:\n\n*   **For star_1 (temperature T_1):**\n    `(N_excited / N_lower)_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n    (Here, `C` represents the constant ratio of statistical weights `g_excited / g_lower`)\n\n*   **For star_2 (temperature T_2):**\n    `(N_excited / N_lower)_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n**3. Using the Information from the Problem**\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2.

Combining and Simplifying the Equations**\n\nNow we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship:\n\n`C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n\nThe constant `C` cancels out from both sides:\n\n`exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n\n`ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n\nUsing the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n`ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n`(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parentheses:\n\n`(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)`\n\n**5.

Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\n`ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^-23 J) / (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\nThe code execution confirmed this, giving a value of `0.9995 K`, which is approximately 1. Substituting this value into our equation:\n\n`1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n`ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\nThis equation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe problem requires applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows the use of this equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation for the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels, `a` and `b`, is given by:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in the higher energy state `b` and lower energy state `a`, respectively.\n*   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   `E_b - E_a` is the energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant, which has a value of approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's define the ratio of excited atoms for each star:\n*   For star 1 with temperature T_1: (N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n*   For star 2 with temperature T_2: (N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2.
