It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since C6 is the only α-carbon with a proton, deprotonation must occur at this position. The steric hindrance of the t-BuOK base is irrelevant for regioselectivity here, as there is no other choice.\n    *   The enolate forms with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate anion (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed from the ethyl acrylate part, which is then protonated during the workup to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The new group, `–CH₂CH₂COOEt`, is attached to C6.\n    *   The carbon at C6, which was tertiary, becomes a quaternary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, the new propanoate chain, C1, and C5 of the ring.\n    *   To name this product, we can treat the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The attachment is at the 3-position of the propanoate.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl ring for IUPAC naming: The point of attachment is C1. The principal functional group (ketone) gets the next lowest number, so the carbonyl is at C2.\n        *   The original C6 is now C1 (with a methyl group).\n        *   The original C1 (carbonyl) is now C2 (oxo group).\n        *   The original C2 is now C3 (with an ethyl and a methyl group).\n    *   The name of the substituent is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) is a nitroalkane. The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN, also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael addition** reaction. The carbanion derived from the nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nitronate Anion (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane.\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `CH₃CH₂CH⁻–NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   In but-2-enenitrile (CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN), the β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate carbanion (α to the nitrile group) is protonated by water (H₂O).\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is formed by connecting the `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)`– unit to the `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` unit.\n    *   The structure is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The nitrile carbon is C1.\n        *   The chain is `C(6)H₃–C(5)H₂–C(4)H(NO₂) –C(3)H(CH₃)–C(2)H₂–C(1)N`.\n        *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the α-carbon.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It has two α-carbons, C2 and C6. The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons to be removed. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one proton. Therefore, the base will abstract the proton from C6, forming an enolate.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate anion, with the negative charge on C6, acts as the nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition that forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** The resulting product has a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this compound as per the given options, the ethyl propanoate part is considered the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is the original C6 of the ring. For naming purposes, this carbon is now C1 of the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1 of the substituent.\n    *   The ketone group (=O) is on the adjacent carbon, which is C2 (the original C1 of the ketone).\n    *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is now C3 of the substituent.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent name is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), removes an acidic α-proton from 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic. This forms a carbanion (a nitronate ion), `[CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)]⁻`, which serves as the Michael donor.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The β-carbon is the one in the `CH₃-CH=` part of the molecule.\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting acyclic structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile end, we find a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan to solve this problem involves a step-by-step analysis of two separate organic chemistry reactions, followed by the selection of the correct option that accurately describes the major products of both.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. We have a ketone that can form an enolate (the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor), and a base (t-BuOK).\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (C2 and C6). The C2 carbon is quaternary and has no α-hydrogens. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one α-hydrogen. The strong, bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the only available α-hydrogen at the less sterically hindered C6 position to form the kinetic enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6-enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product A Structure and Naming:** The resulting product is named as an ethyl propanoate derivative, where the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent. According to IUPAC rules, we number the ring to give the principal functional groups the lowest possible locants, starting from the point of attachment. The point of attachment (original C6) becomes C1. The carbonyl group (original C1) is at C2. The ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) are at C3. The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1. This leads to the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:** The base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** This carbanion attacks the β-carbon (C3) of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n4.  **Product B Structure and Naming:** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile. To name the product, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN). The chain is six carbons long (hexanenitrile). The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4. The resulting name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.

This is a ketone that can be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The combination of a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and a base indicates a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The α-carbons of the ketone are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group) and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. The base removes the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate. This enolate is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate attacks the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate). The nucleophilic carbon is C6 of the enolate.\n    *   The attack occurs at the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group), which is the electrophilic site in a conjugate addition.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product A):**\n    *   After the addition and subsequent protonation (workup), the new substituent, a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group (an ethyl propanoate group), is attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   The resulting molecule is `6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n    *   The options provide names where the product is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. We must name the cyclohexanone part as a substituent.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`. The cyclohexyl ring is the substituent at position 3.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (C1'). This was C6 in the original ketone.\n    *   The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1' of the substituent name.\n    *   The carbonyl group (oxo) was at C1 of the ketone, which is adjacent to C6. So, the oxo group is at C2' in the new numbering.\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups were at C2 of the ketone, which is adjacent to the carbonyl C1. So, these groups are at C3' in the new numbering.\n    *   The substituents on the cyclohexyl ring are: a methyl at C1', an oxo at C2', and an ethyl and a methyl at C3'.\n    *   Alphabetizing and numbering gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN), also known as crotononitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`), which is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product B):**\n    *   After the addition and protonation by water, the final product is formed by connecting the two fragments:\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a **Michael addition** reaction. The reaction involves an enolate (from the ketone) acting as a nucleophile and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) acting as a Michael acceptor. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base used to generate the enolate.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no** α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the α-hydrogen at the C6 position. This forms a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system. In this case, the β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n\n4.  **The Reaction:**\n    *   The enolate (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the initial addition, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated during the workup step to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring structure is maintained.\n    *   The substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) are unchanged.\n    *   At C6, the original hydrogen is replaced by the ethyl acrylate-derived group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (an ethoxycarbonylethyl group).\n    *   The resulting structure is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n6.  **Name the Product A and Compare with Options:**\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the propanoate chain is the parent and the cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. Let's re-name our product according to this convention to match the options.\n    *   The main chain is ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexyl group is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment to the propanoate chain is designated as C1.\n        *   The carbon of attachment (our original C6) has a methyl group. So, we have a **1-methyl** substituent.\n        *   The carbonyl group is on the adjacent carbon (our original C1), which becomes C2 in the substituent name. So, we have a **2-oxo** group.\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (our original C2) is now C3 in the substituent name. So, we have **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl** substituents.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for A in options A and C. The name in options B and D, which describes a 4-oxo product, is incorrect as the Michael addition occurs at the α-carbon (C6), adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane provides the nucleophile (a carbanion), and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the -NO₂ group.\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, which is the CH carbon attached to the methyl group.\n\n4.  **The Reaction:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The new bond connects `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` to the `CH(CH₃)` part of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n6.  **Name the Product B and Compare with Options:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (-CN).\n    *   The chain is: `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`.\n    *   This is a 6-carbon chain, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for B in options A and D. The name in options B and C is incorrect; it corresponds to a different molecule with a different number of carbon atoms.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given choices, only option A contains both correct product names.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile. The ethyl acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the site of enolate formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The carbon at position 2 (C2) is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has no α-protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 (C6) is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since C6 is the only position with an α-proton, the bulky base t-BuOK will exclusively deprotonate this carbon to form the corresponding enolate.\n\n3.  **Predict the Michael addition product:** The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) in a conjugate addition. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product has the cyclohexanone core with the original substituents (ethyl and methyl at C2, methyl at C6) and a new substituent at C6, which is an ethyl propanoate group attached via its C3.\n    *   Let's name this product. If we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3. The numbering of the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent starts at the point of attachment (C1).\n        *   The point of attachment (our original C6) is now C1 of the substituent name. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The carbonyl group (original C1) is adjacent, so it is at C2.\n        *   The quaternary carbon (original C2) is at position C3. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a nitro-Michael addition, a variation of the Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nitronate anion which is a potent nucleophile (a Michael donor). (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the α,β-unsaturated Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** KOH deprotonates the C1 of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nitronate anion, [CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]⁻.\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The nucleophilic attack will occur at the β-carbon (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the -CN group).\n\n3.  **Predict the Michael addition product:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the original but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   The structure of the product is CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n    *   To name this compound, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is six carbons long, so it is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        *   N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Reactant Analysis and Enolate Formation**:\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It's important to correctly identify the structure and the available α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The name `2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one` and `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one` refer to the same molecule, just with different numbering schemes for the carbon ring. Let's analyze the structure based on the name that clarifies the reactive site.\n    *   Using the name `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one`, the carbonyl group is at position C2. The α-carbons are C1 and C3.\n    *   C3 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate the ketone at the C1 position. This removes any ambiguity about which enolate is formed.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**:\n    *   The enolate formed at C1 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After protonation (typically from the solvent or during workup), the final product is formed.\n\n4.  **Product Identification**:\n    *   The resulting molecule has an ethyl propanoate group attached to the C1 position of the `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl` ring.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for this product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the product A listed in options C and D.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the carbon alpha to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion. This anion then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n\n2.  **Reactant Analysis and Nucleophile Formation**:\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2`) to form the nitronate anion `[CH3-CH2-CH-NO2]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**:\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane part and C3 of the butenenitrile part.\n\n4.  **Product Identification**:\n    *   The initial adduct is protonated by water to give the final product: `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile, we have a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the product B listed in options A and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option C contains both correct products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the alpha-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (C2 and C6). The C2 carbon is quaternary and has no hydrogens. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one acidic alpha-hydrogen. Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only remove the proton from the C6 position, forming a single regioselective enolate.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate formed at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure**: After the addition and subsequent protonation (during workup), a `-CH2-CH2-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone. The product is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n5.  **Product Naming**: To name this product according to IUPAC rules, the ester is considered the principal functional group, making the \"ethyl propanoate\" the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is attached at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl substituent ring starts with C1 at the point of attachment. The ketone group should have the lowest possible number, which makes it C2.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are a methyl group at C1 (the original C6-methyl) and an ethyl and a methyl group at C3 (the original C2-substituents).\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon), which is acidic. The resulting nitronate anion is a nucleophile (a Michael donor). This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`) to form the resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, `[CH3CH2CH-NO2]⁻`.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The resulting structure after protonation by water is `CH3-CH(CH(NO2)CH2CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n5.  **Product Naming**: To name this product, the nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group, and the carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain: `CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.

This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Enolate Formation (Deprotonation)**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of the ketone:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-hydrogens**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has an α-hydrogen, the base will exclusively deprotonate this position to form the enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition)**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate acts as the nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The nucleophile is the cyclohexanone enolate (attacking from C6).\n    *   The electrophile is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The reaction involves a nucleophile (an enolate) adding to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, will be deprotonated to form the enolate (the Michael donor).\n    *   The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base used to form the enolate.\n    *   The α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate, is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):** The base abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone. We must identify the available α-protons.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The base t-BuOK will remove this single available proton to form a specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:** The enolate, which is nucleophilic at C6, attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:** After the addition and subsequent protonation during workup, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To match the format of the given options, we name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. The numbering proceeds to give the principal functional group (the oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2. The original C2 (with the ethyl and methyl groups) becomes C3.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are: a methyl group at C1, an oxo group at C2, and an ethyl and a methyl group at C3.\n    *   Combining these, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   The nitroalkane, 1-nitropropane, is deprotonated to form a carbanion (a nitronate anion), which acts as the Michael donor.\n    *   The base is potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   The α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Nucleophile):** The base (KOH) removes an acidic proton from the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:** The nucleophilic carbanion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group. A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:** After the addition and protonation by water, the final structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`. To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for A in options A and C.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name for B in options A and D.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the α-carbon.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It has two α-carbons, C2 and C6. The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons to be removed. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one proton. Therefore, the base will abstract the proton from C6, forming an enolate.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate anion, with the negative charge on C6, acts as the nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition that forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** The resulting product has a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this compound as per the given options, the ethyl propanoate part is considered the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is the original C6 of the ring. For naming purposes, this carbon is now C1 of the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1 of the substituent.\n    *   The ketone group (=O) is on the adjacent carbon, which is C2 (the original C1 of the ketone).\n    *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is now C3 of the substituent.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent name is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), removes an acidic α-proton from 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic. This forms a carbanion (a nitronate ion), `[CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)]⁻`, which serves as the Michael donor.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The β-carbon is the one in the `CH₃-CH=` part of the molecule.\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting acyclic structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile end, we find a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan to solve this problem involves a step-by-step analysis of two separate organic chemistry reactions, followed by the selection of the correct option that accurately describes the major products of both.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. We have a ketone that can form an enolate (the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor), and a base (t-BuOK).\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (C2 and C6). The C2 carbon is quaternary and has no α-hydrogens. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one α-hydrogen. The strong, bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the only available α-hydrogen at the less sterically hindered C6 position to form the kinetic enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6-enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product A Structure and Naming:** The resulting product is named as an ethyl propanoate derivative, where the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent. According to IUPAC rules, we number the ring to give the principal functional groups the lowest possible locants, starting from the point of attachment. The point of attachment (original C6) becomes C1. The carbonyl group (original C1) is at C2. The ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) are at C3. The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1. This leads to the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:** The base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** This carbanion attacks the β-carbon (C3) of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n4.  **Product B Structure and Naming:** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile. To name the product, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN). The chain is six carbons long (hexanenitrile). The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4. The resulting name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.

We must name the cyclohexanone part as a substituent.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`. The cyclohexyl ring is the substituent at position 3.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (C1'). This was C6 in the original ketone.\n    *   The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1' of the substituent name.\n    *   The carbonyl group (oxo) was at C1 of the ketone, which is adjacent to C6. So, the oxo group is at C2' in the new numbering.\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups were at C2 of the ketone, which is adjacent to the carbonyl C1. So, these groups are at C3' in the new numbering.\n    *   The substituents on the cyclohexyl ring are: a methyl at C1', an oxo at C2', and an ethyl and a methyl at C3'.\n    *   Alphabetizing and numbering gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN), also known as crotononitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`), which is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product B):**\n    *   After the addition and protonation by water, the final product is formed by connecting the two fragments:\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a **Michael addition** reaction. The reaction involves an enolate (from the ketone) acting as a nucleophile and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) acting as a Michael acceptor. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base used to generate the enolate.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no** α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the α-hydrogen at the C6 position. This forms a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system. In this case, the β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n\n4.  **The Reaction:**\n    *   The enolate (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the initial addition, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated during the workup step to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring structure is maintained.\n    *   The substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) are unchanged.\n    *   At C6, the original hydrogen is replaced by the ethyl acrylate-derived group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (an ethoxycarbonylethyl group).\n    *   The resulting structure is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n6.  **Name the Product A and Compare with Options:**\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the propanoate chain is the parent and the cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. Let's re-name our product according to this convention to match the options.\n    *   The main chain is ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexyl group is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment to the propanoate chain is designated as C1.\n        *   The carbon of attachment (our original C6) has a methyl group. So, we have a **1-methyl** substituent.\n        *   The carbonyl group is on the adjacent carbon (our original C1), which becomes C2 in the substituent name. So, we have a **2-oxo** group.\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (our original C2) is now C3 in the substituent name. So, we have **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl** substituents.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for A in options A and C. The name in options B and D, which describes a 4-oxo product, is incorrect as the Michael addition occurs at the α-carbon (C6), adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane provides the nucleophile (a carbanion), and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the -NO₂ group.\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, which is the CH carbon attached to the methyl group.\n\n4.  **The Reaction:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The new bond connects `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` to the `CH(CH₃)` part of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n6.  **Name the Product B and Compare with Options:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (-CN).\n    *   The chain is: `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`.\n    *   This is a 6-carbon chain, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for B in options A and D. The name in options B and C is incorrect; it corresponds to a different molecule with a different number of carbon atoms.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given choices, only option A contains both correct product names.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile. The ethyl acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the site of enolate formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The carbon at position 2 (C2) is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has no α-protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 (C6) is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since C6 is the only position with an α-proton, the bulky base t-BuOK will exclusively deprotonate this carbon to form the corresponding enolate.\n\n3.  **Predict the Michael addition product:** The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) in a conjugate addition. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product has the cyclohexanone core with the original substituents (ethyl and methyl at C2, methyl at C6) and a new substituent at C6, which is an ethyl propanoate group attached via its C3.\n    *   Let's name this product. If we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3. The numbering of the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent starts at the point of attachment (C1).\n        *   The point of attachment (our original C6) is now C1 of the substituent name. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The carbonyl group (original C1) is adjacent, so it is at C2.\n        *   The quaternary carbon (original C2) is at position C3. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a nitro-Michael addition, a variation of the Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nitronate anion which is a potent nucleophile (a Michael donor). (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the α,β-unsaturated Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** KOH deprotonates the C1 of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nitronate anion, [CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]⁻.\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The nucleophilic attack will occur at the β-carbon (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the -CN group).\n\n3.  **Predict the Michael addition product:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the original but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   The structure of the product is CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n    *   To name this compound, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is six carbons long, so it is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        *   N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Reactant Analysis and Enolate Formation**:\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It's important to correctly identify the structure and the available α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The name `2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one` and `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one` refer to the same molecule, just with different numbering schemes for the carbon ring. Let's analyze the structure based on the name that clarifies the reactive site.\n    *   Using the name `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one`, the carbonyl group is at position C2. The α-carbons are C1 and C3.\n    *   C3 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate the ketone at the C1 position. This removes any ambiguity about which enolate is formed.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**:\n    *   The enolate formed at C1 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After protonation (typically from the solvent or during workup), the final product is formed.\n\n4.  **Product Identification**:\n    *   The resulting molecule has an ethyl propanoate group attached to the C1 position of the `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl` ring.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for this product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the product A listed in options C and D.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the carbon alpha to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion. This anion then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n\n2.  **Reactant Analysis and Nucleophile Formation**:\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2`) to form the nitronate anion `[CH3-CH2-CH-NO2]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**:\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane part and C3 of the butenenitrile part.\n\n4.  **Product Identification**:\n    *   The initial adduct is protonated by water to give the final product: `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile, we have a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the product B listed in options A and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option C contains both correct products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the alpha-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (C2 and C6). The C2 carbon is quaternary and has no hydrogens. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one acidic alpha-hydrogen. Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only remove the proton from the C6 position, forming a single regioselective enolate.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate formed at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure**: After the addition and subsequent protonation (during workup), a `-CH2-CH2-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone. The product is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n5.  **Product Naming**: To name this product according to IUPAC rules, the ester is considered the principal functional group, making the \"ethyl propanoate\" the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is attached at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl substituent ring starts with C1 at the point of attachment. The ketone group should have the lowest possible number, which makes it C2.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are a methyl group at C1 (the original C6-methyl) and an ethyl and a methyl group at C3 (the original C2-substituents).\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon), which is acidic. The resulting nitronate anion is a nucleophile (a Michael donor). This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`) to form the resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, `[CH3CH2CH-NO2]⁻`.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The resulting structure after protonation by water is `CH3-CH(CH(NO2)CH2CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n5.  **Product Naming**: To name this product, the nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group, and the carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain: `CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.

The resulting enolate will have a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** The resulting product will have an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. The full structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Product Naming:** To match the options provided, we name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The main chain is the ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent attached at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is designated as C1. The carbonyl group (the original C1) is at the adjacent position, C2. The original C2, bearing the ethyl and methyl groups, becomes C3.\n    *   Following this numbering, the substituent name is: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of the nitroalkane.\n\n1.  **Nitronate Formation:** The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group) is acidic. KOH removes a proton to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion, `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻`.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** After the addition and subsequent protonation by water, the resulting structure is `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n\n4.  **Product Naming:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is named as a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the carbon of the nitrile group as C1.\n    *   The chain is `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Thus, the name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. It involves the conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (a ketone).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The base, t-BuOK, deprotonates the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate anion.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The bulky nature of t-BuOK favors the formation of the kinetic enolate (from the less substituted α-carbon), but in this case, C6 is the only option.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The enolate anion, with the nucleophilic charge on C6, attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   **Enolate (nucleophile):** The anion at C6 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   **Ethyl Acrylate (acceptor):** CH₂=CH−COOEt. The attack occurs at the CH₂ carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The initial ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The ethyl propanoate group (-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt) is added to the C6 position.\n    *   To name the final product, we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n    *   The ring is attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. The point of attachment (originally C6) is numbered as C1. This carbon has a methyl group. The carbonyl carbon (originally C1) is now at C2 (hence \"2-oxo\"). The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (originally C2) is now at C3.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane. The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (an α,β-unsaturated nitrile).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate Anion):** The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion.\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ [CH₃CH₂CH=NO₂]⁻ K⁺ + H₂O. The nucleophilic attack occurs from the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   **Nitronate (nucleophile):** The anion at C1 of the 1-nitropropane.\n    *   **But-2-enenitrile (acceptor):** CH₃-CH=CH-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The resulting structure after protonation by water is: CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile functional group.\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1): CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThe correct combination of products is found in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
