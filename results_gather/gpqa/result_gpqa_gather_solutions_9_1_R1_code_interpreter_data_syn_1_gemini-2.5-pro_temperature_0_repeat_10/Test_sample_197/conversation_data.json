Understand the System**\n\nWe have a solution containing cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻). These ions react to form a series of complexes:\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Use the Stability Constants**\n\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion ([Co²⁺]) and the free ligand ([SCN⁻]):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Make a Simplifying Assumption**\n\nThe total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). This means the amount of thiocyanate that gets bound into complexes is relatively small compared to the total amount present. Therefore, we can approximate the concentration of free thiocyanate, [SCN⁻], as being equal to its total initial concentration.\nAssumption: [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Fraction of the Desired Complex**\n\nWe want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. This is the fraction of this complex (α₂) multiplied by 100.\n\nThe fraction α₂ is given by:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow substitute this and the expression for [[Co(SCN)₂]] into the formula for α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Plug in the Values and Calculate**\n\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   1 = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to get the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the complex we are interested in, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**6. Convert to Percentage**\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate its mole fraction among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe formation of each complex is defined by its overall stability constant (β):\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)ₙ], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the mole fraction (α₂) is:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the concentrations of all species, we can derive a formula for the mole fraction that depends only on the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]) and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe problem states the following values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nNote that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not required to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, assuming the provided [SCN⁻] is the equilibrium concentration.\n\nNow, we can calculate the terms in the denominator of the mole fraction equation:\n*   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\nSum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nNow, we calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The mole fraction of a specific complex can be determined using the stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the species:** The cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free Co²⁺ ion and the complexes [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n2.  **Formulate the mole fraction equation:** The fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is given by the concentration of that complex divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species. This can be expressed in terms of the stability constants and the ligand concentration:\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n3.  **Use the given values:** We are given the stability constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄) and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is not needed for this calculation as it cancels out.\n4.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute the given values into the formula to find the fraction α₂, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given concentration of thiocyanate ligand [SCN-]\nscn_conc = 0.1  # M\n\n# The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of all cobalt-containing species:\n# c(Co) = [Co2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4]2-\n# Using stability constants, we can express each term relative to [Co2+]:\n# c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n# The concentration of the target complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II), is:\n# [Co(SCN)2] = beta2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2\n\n# The percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is ([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) * 100.\n# The [Co2+] term cancels out, so we can calculate the fraction directly.\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the fraction (often denoted as Φ)\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc**1 + beta2 * scn_conc**2 + beta3 * scn_conc**3 + beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# Calculate the numerator term for the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator_CoSCN2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2) of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nalpha_2 = numerator_CoSCN2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 42.3%\")\nprint(\"B) 38.1%\")\nprint(\"C) 25.6%\")\nprint(\"D) 16.9%\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option D.\")\n\n<<<D>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 43\n    <<<D>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Given Information and Species**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M.\n*   Thiocyanate ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M.\n*   Overall stability constants:\n    *   `β₁` = 9 for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `β₂` = 40 for `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   `β₃` = 63 for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `β₄` = 16 for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n*   The cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n    *   Free aquated ion: `Co²⁺`\n    *   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Equations**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants `βn`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Fraction of the Desired Complex**\nThe percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100.

This simplifies the equation, showing that the distribution of species depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4.

Understand the System**\n\nWe have a solution containing cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻). These ions react to form a series of complexes:\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Use the Stability Constants**\n\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion ([Co²⁺]) and the free ligand ([SCN⁻]):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Make a Simplifying Assumption**\n\nThe total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). This means the amount of thiocyanate that gets bound into complexes is relatively small compared to the total amount present. Therefore, we can approximate the concentration of free thiocyanate, [SCN⁻], as being equal to its total initial concentration.\nAssumption: [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Fraction of the Desired Complex**\n\nWe want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. This is the fraction of this complex (α₂) multiplied by 100.\n\nThe fraction α₂ is given by:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow substitute this and the expression for [[Co(SCN)₂]] into the formula for α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Plug in the Values and Calculate**\n\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   1 = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to get the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the complex we are interested in, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**6. Convert to Percentage**\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate its mole fraction among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe formation of each complex is defined by its overall stability constant (β):\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)ₙ], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the mole fraction (α₂) is:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the concentrations of all species, we can derive a formula for the mole fraction that depends only on the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]) and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe problem states the following values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nNote that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not required to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, assuming the provided [SCN⁻] is the equilibrium concentration.\n\nNow, we can calculate the terms in the denominator of the mole fraction equation:\n*   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\nSum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nNow, we calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.
