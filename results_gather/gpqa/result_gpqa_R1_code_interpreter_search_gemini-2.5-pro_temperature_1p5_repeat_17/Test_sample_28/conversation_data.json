    "This question asks to identify which mutation in a gene is most likely to eliminate the production of an anti-nutritional compound. To eliminate the compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be rendered non-functional. The most effective way to create a non-functional, or \"knockout,\" gene is to introduce a mutation that results in a truncated and non-functional protein.\n\n### **Reasoning and Analysis**\n\n1.  **Goal:** The objective is to find a mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. In molecular biology, the most certain way to achieve this early in a gene's coding sequence is to introduce a **nonsense mutation**, which changes an amino acid-coding codon into a **stop codon** (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This terminates translation prematurely, producing a short, non-functional peptide. Other mutations like frameshifts (insertions/deletions not in multiples of three) are also highly likely to knock out gene function, while missense mutations (changing one amino acid to another) are less predictable in their effect.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   The sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`, which is the start codon, initiating protein synthesis with the amino acid Methionine (Met).\n    *   We can read the sequence in codons (groups of three bases) to determine the original amino acid sequence.\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n    *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...\n\n3.  **Evaluating Each Mutant:** We will analyze each mutant sequence by reading its codons from the start (`ATG`) and comparing the resulting amino acid sequence to the intact one.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Translation: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly ...\n        *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. While changing an amino acid can sometimes inactivate a protein, it is not guaranteed. The protein might retain partial or full function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Translation: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n        *   Analysis: The sequence shows that the third codon has become `TAA`, which is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. The synthesis of the protein will stop after only two amino acids (Met-Phe). The resulting dipeptide will be completely non-functional. This is the most definitive way to eliminate the function of the gene product.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n        *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact sequence, we see a change in the third codon `CTC` -> `TAC` (a missense mutation from Leu to Tyr) and an insertion of a new codon, `GTC` (Valine), after the fifth codon. This results in one changed amino acid and one inserted amino acid. The rest of the protein is in the correct reading frame. This complex change might disrupt function but is less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Analysis: Here, the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAC` (a missense mutation from Leu to Tyr), and the fifth codon, `GGT` (Glycine), has been deleted. This causes a change in one amino acid and the deletion of another. This is a significant change that is likely to be detrimental to the protein's function, but it is still not as definitive as the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAmong the given options, **Mutant 2** is the one that introduces a premature stop codon very early in the protein sequence. This will result in a severely truncated, non-functional protein, thereby reliably eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutations lead to amino acid changes, insertions, or deletions, which might inactivate the protein but without the certainty of a nonsense mutation.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n```python\ndef translate_dna(seq):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence.\"\"\"\n    table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_STOP_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n    protein = \"\"\n    end = len(seq) - (len(seq) % 3)\n    for i in range(0, end, 3):\n        codon = seq[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = table.get(codon, 'X')\n        protein += amino_acid + \"-\"\n        if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n            break\n    return protein.strip('-')\n\n# Provided sequences - corrected to represent the codon changes described in the options\n# The question has some typos in the mutant strings, but the implied codon changes are what matter.\n# We construct the sequences based on the most plausible single/double codon changes.\n\n# Intact Gene\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n# Mutant 1: CTC -> TAC (3rd codon)\nmutant1_seq = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n# Mutant 2: CTC -> TAA (3rd codon), plus a likely silent TTT->TTC\n# Let's use the provided sequence string directly as it clearly illustrates the stop codon.\nmutant2_seq = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n\n# Mutant 3: CTC -> TAC (missense) and insertion of GTC\nmutant3_seq = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n# Mutant 4: CTC -> TAC (missense) and deletion of GGT\nmutant4_seq = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\nprint(\"Analysis of Gene Mutations\")\nprint(\"=\"*30)\nprint(f\"Intact Translation:  {translate_dna(intact_gene)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 1 Translation: {translate_dna(mutant1_seq)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 2 Translation: {translate_dna(mutant2_seq)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 3 Translation: {translate_dna(mutant3_seq)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 4 Translation: {translate_dna(mutant4_seq)}\")\nprint(\"\\nConclusion: Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon, which is the most reliable way to create a non-functional protein.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to identify the mutation most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound produced by a gene. Eliminating the compound requires inactivating the gene that synthesizes it. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein.\n\n### **Analysis of Gene Function and Mutations**\n\n1.  **Protein Synthesis:** The process of creating a protein from a gene (transcription and translation) starts at a specific `ATG` codon (start codon) and proceeds by reading groups of three DNA bases (codons) until a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`) is reached.\n2.  **Goal:** To eliminate the protein's function, the best mutation would be one that stops this process very early. This is called a **nonsense mutation**, where a regular codon is changed into a stop codon. This results in a severely shortened (truncated) and non-functional protein.\n3.  **Other Mutations:**\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This *might* inactivate the protein if the change is in a critical region, but it could also have little or no effect.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (Insertion/Deletion):** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence from that point on. This is very likely to inactivate the protein but might theoretically produce a new, shorter protein with a different function if a new stop codon is encountered quickly.\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid sequence. It has no effect on the protein.\n\n### **Evaluating the Mutant Sequences**\n\nLet's break down the DNA sequences into codons and translate them to see the effect of each mutation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Translation: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Effect: This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. This may or may not inactivate the protein. It is less certain to work than other types of mutations.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA` (Stop Codon). *Note: The second codon `TTT` also changed to `TTC`, but both code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation.*\n    *   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon signals for translation to stop. The resulting \"protein\" will only be two amino acids long (Met-Phe). This peptide will be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the target compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   Change: This involves a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (missense) and an insertion of `GTC`. This is a complex mutation, but the reading frame is maintained after the insertion. It results in a different protein sequence but does not guarantee inactivation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Change: This involves a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (missense) and a deletion of `GGT`. This is a significant alteration, likely to disrupt function, but not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nMutant 2 is the most effective choice because it introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position. This will terminate protein synthesis almost immediately, guaranteeing that no functional protein is produced, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
