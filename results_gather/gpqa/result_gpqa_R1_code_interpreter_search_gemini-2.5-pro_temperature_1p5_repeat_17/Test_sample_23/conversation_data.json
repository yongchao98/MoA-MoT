    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, let's denote its formula as CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen (%H) is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7.\n    *   Let's verify this assumption. %H = (Atomic Mass of H * m) / (Atomic Mass of C * n + Atomic Mass of H * m). Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12):\n        %H = m / (12n + m) = 1/7\n        7m = 12n + m\n        6m = 12n\n        m = 2n\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Let's check the mass fraction for C6H12 using more precise masses (C≈12.01, H≈1.008):\n        %H = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.01 + 12 * 1.008) * 100 = 12.096 / (72.06 + 12.096) * 100 = 12.096 / 84.156 * 100 ≈ 14.37%. The given 14.28% corresponds well to the CnH2n formula, and cyclohexane is the most logical candidate based on the chemical context. Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components either lack C=C/C≡C bonds (are saturated) or are aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y (both C and D) gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   The other component, C, must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane (Z). It must also not decolorize bromine water. A saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane) would not typically be described as \"hydrogenating\" to cyclohexane. A much better candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst for bromination) and it is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature), which is mentioned in the problem.\n    *   So, mixture **Y consists of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X → Y**\n    *   Mixture X (equimolar A + B) reacts upon heating with platinum to form mixture Y (equimolar C + D).\n    *   A + B → C + D\n    *   Substituting the identities of C and D: A + B → C6H6 + C6H12.\n    *   This is a disproportionation reaction, specifically a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides. All substances (A, B, C, D) have a C6 skeleton.\n        C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H6 + C6H12\n    *   This implies that the total number of hydrogen atoms is conserved: x + y = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X consists of two equimolar liquids, A (C6Hx) and B (C6Hy).\n    *   Mixture X *does* decolorize bromine water, so both A and B are unsaturated (they contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The problem states there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n    *   We need to find two unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogen counts (x and y) sum to 18.\n    *   Common unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons include:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   Cyclohexadienes (C6H8)\n    *   Let's check if this pair works: x=10 and y=8. The sum is 10 + 8 = 18. This fits the requirement.\n    *   Therefore, mixture X consists of a cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene but allows for **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. **Cyclohexene (C6H10)** only has one double bond, so it also fits this condition.\n    *   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer between these two compounds. For example:\n        C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n        In this specific balanced reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses 2H to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains 2H to become cyclohexane. This is a plausible 1:1 reaction that produces an equimolar mixture.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
