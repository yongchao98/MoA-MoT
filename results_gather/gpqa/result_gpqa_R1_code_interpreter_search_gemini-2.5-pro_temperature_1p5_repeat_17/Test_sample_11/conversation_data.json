    "This is a classic particle physics problem involving a two-body decay from rest. We will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to solve it.\n\n**1. Understand the process:**\nThe decay is given by:\n$Pi^+ -> mu^+ + nu$\n\nThe parent particle, the positive pion ($Pi^+$), is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero, and its initial total energy is its rest mass energy.\nThe products are a positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$).\n\n**2. List the given information:**\n*   Rest mass energy of Pion ($m_{Pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of Muon ($m_{mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The Pion is stationary ($p_{Pi}$ = 0).\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino ($m_{nu}c^2$) is negligible and can be taken as 0.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    Let 'p' be the magnitude of the momentum of both the muon and the neutrino.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{nu}| = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{Pi}c^2 = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$\n    where $E_{mu}$ and $E_{nu}$ are the total energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.\n\n**4. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) of a particle are related by the equation:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$\n\n*   For the muon ($mu^+$):\n    $E_{mu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n\n*   For the neutrino ($nu$):\n    Since we assume its rest mass is zero ($m_{nu} = 0$), its energy is given by:\n    $E_{nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + 0  => E_{nu} = pc$\n    Also, for a massless particle, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, so $KE_{nu} = E_{nu} = pc$.\n\n**5. Solving for the energies:**\n\nWe have a system of equations:\n1.  $m_{Pi}c^2 = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$\n2.  $E_{nu} = pc$\n3.  $E_{mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2}$\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n$m_{Pi}c^2 = E_{mu} + pc  => E_{mu} = m_{Pi}c^2 - pc$\n\nNow, we have two expressions for $E_{mu}$. Let's square this new one:\n$E_{mu}^2 = (m_{Pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n\nEquate this with the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n$(pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2 = (m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ term on both sides cancels out. Rearranging to solve for `pc`:\n$2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{Pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6. Calculation:**\nWe can use a simple python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate pc (momentum * c) using the derived formula\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to pc\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu_c2)^2)\nE_mu = (pc**2 + m_mu_c2**2)**0.5\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon ($KE_{mu}$) ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino ($KE_{nu}$) ≈ 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78)\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n**1.  Identify the Physics Principles**\nThis problem describes the decay of a particle from rest. The fundamental principles governing this process are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the product particles can be a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2.  State Initial and Final Conditions**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single stationary positive pion ($Pi^+$).\n    *   Initial momentum ($p_{initial}$) = 0.\n    *   Initial total energy ($E_{initial}$) is just its rest mass energy: $E_{initial} = m_{Pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV.\n\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$).\n    *   Let the momentum of the muon be $\\vec{p}_{mu}$ and the momentum of the neutrino be $\\vec{p}_{nu}$.\n    *   Let the total energy of the muon be $E_{mu}$ and the total energy of the neutrino be $E_{nu}$.\n\n**3.  Apply Conservation of Momentum**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after.\n$p_{initial} = \\vec{p}_{mu} + \\vec{p}_{nu}$\n$0 = \\vec{p}_{mu} + \\vec{p}_{nu}$\n$\\vec{p}_{mu} = -\\vec{p}_{nu}$\n\nThis shows that the muon and the neutrino must fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n$|\\vec{p}_{mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{nu}| = p$\n\n**4.  Apply Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after.\n$E_{initial} = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$\n$m_{Pi}c^2 = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$\n\n**5.  Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$\n\n*   For the muon ($mu^+$): It has a rest mass $m_{mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV.\n    $E_{mu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n\n*   For the neutrino ($nu$): Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered to be zero in this context ($m_{nu} \\approx 0$).\n    $E_{nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + 0  \\implies E_{nu} = pc$\n\n**6.  Solve for the Energies**\nWe now have a system of equations to solve.\n\n1.  From energy conservation: $E_{mu} = m_{Pi}c^2 - E_{nu}$\n2.  Substitute $E_{nu} = pc$: $E_{mu} = m_{Pi}c^2 - pc$\n3.  Square this equation: $E_{mu}^2 = (m_{Pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n4.  Now, set this equal to the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n    $(pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2 = (m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n5.  The $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. Rearrange to solve for `pc` (the momentum of the particles):\n    $2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{Pi}c^2)}$\n\n**7.  Calculate Numerical Values**\nUsing the provided python code's output:\n\n*   The momentum value is calculated: $pc = 29.78$ MeV.\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{nu}$):** For a massless particle, its total energy is its kinetic energy. Therefore, $KE_{nu} = E_{nu} = pc = 29.78$ MeV. This can be rounded to **29.8 MeV**.\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{mu}$):** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy ($KE = E - mc^2$). We can find the muon's total energy using the conservation equation:\n    $E_{mu} = m_{Pi}c^2 - E_{nu} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 109.82$ MeV.\n    Now, calculate its kinetic energy:\n    $KE_{mu} = E_{mu} - m_{mu}c^2 = 109.82 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 4.12$ MeV.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe kinetic energy of the muon ($mu^+$) is 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($nu$) is 29.8 MeV. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
