    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    For planets orbiting the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{a} \\right)^{1/2}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n    When we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (e.g., planet 'i' and planet 'j'), we get:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} = \\left( \\frac{a_j}{a_i} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n2.  **Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the orbital distances.**\n    We are given:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\n    Using the relationship from step 1, we can find the ratios of the semi-major axes ($a$):\n    *   For Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = 1.4 \\implies \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 1.4^2 = 1.96$\n    *   For Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2} = 2.3 \\implies \\frac{a_3}{a_2} = 2.3^2 = 5.29$\n\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$), we multiply the two ratios:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n3.  **Analyze the relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance (Kepler's Third Law).**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3 \\implies P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n    The information about planet masses and the TTV discovery method is extra information.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's orbital distance and albedo. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the temperature of the central star.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the central star.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    Since all three exoplanets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants for the system. The problem also states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance simplifies to a proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n    From this proportionality, if we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (let's say planet 'i' and planet 'j'), we get:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} = \\frac{a_j^{1/2}}{a_i^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_j}{a_i} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n2.  **Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the orbital distances.**\n    We are given the following temperature ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\n    Now, let's use the formula from step 1 to find the ratios of the orbital distances ($a$):\n    *   For Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = 1.4$\n        Squaring both sides gives us the ratio of their orbital distances:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 1.4^2 = 1.96$\n    *   For Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2} = 2.3$\n        Squaring both sides gives us:\n        $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = 2.3^2 = 5.29$\n\n    Our goal is to find the relationship between Planet 3 and Planet 1. We can find the ratio of their orbital distances, $\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$, by multiplying the two ratios we just calculated:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law to relate Orbital Period and Orbital Distance.**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This implies that the period is proportional to the semi-major axis raised to the power of 3/2:\n    $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n    (Note: The information about the planet masses and the TTV method is extraneous detail. For planets orbiting a much more massive central star, the planet's own mass has a negligible effect on its orbital period, so we can use this simplified form of Kepler's law.)\n\n    Taking the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet 3 and Planet 1:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the final factor.**\n    We can now substitute the value for the ratio of the orbital distances ($\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = 10.3684$) into the equation from step 3:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{1.5}$\n\n    Let's compute this value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios\nT1_T2 = 1.4\nT2_T3 = 2.3\n\n# Calculate ratio of semi-major axes\n# a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2\na2_over_a1 = T1_T2**2\n\n# a3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2\na3_over_a2 = T2_T3**2\n\n# a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1)\na3_over_a1 = a3_over_a2 * a2_over_a1\n\n# Calculate ratio of orbital periods using Kepler's Third Law\n# P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)\nP3_over_P1 = a3_over_a1**(3/2)\n\nprint(P3_over_P1)\n\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately 33.386.

Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    From this proportionality, the ratio of the temperatures of two planets (i and j) is related to the ratio of their orbital distances:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} = \\left( \\frac{a_j}{a_i} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n2.  **Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the orbital distances.**\n    We are given:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\approx 2.3$\n\n    Using the relationship from step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n    *   For Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n        $\\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = 1.4 \\implies \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 1.4^2 = 1.96$\n    *   For Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n        $\\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2} = 2.3 \\implies \\frac{a_3}{a_2} = 2.3^2 = 5.29$\n\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$), we multiply the two intermediate ratios:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law.**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its semi-major axis ($a$).
