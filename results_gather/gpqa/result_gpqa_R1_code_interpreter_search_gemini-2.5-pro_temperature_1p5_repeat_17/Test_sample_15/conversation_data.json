    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. This molecule contains no sp3 carbon bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is not an allene, biphenyl, or helicene, which are special cases of chirality without chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the C=C double bond. While the ethyl and methyl groups are not entirely in this plane, free rotation of the single bonds allows for a conformation where a plane of symmetry exists. A molecule that can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself provides the key information. The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. The `(E)` descriptor specifies the geometry at a double bond.\n    *   When a compound's name includes specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it refers to a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer is optically active unless it is a *meso* compound (an achiral compound with chiral centers).\n    *   Given the complexity of this bicyclic structure and the presence of the asymmetric `(E)-chloromethylene` substituent, it is extremely unlikely that the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry or center of inversion that would render it meso.\n    *   Thus, the name describes a single enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (2R, 3S). Let's examine its structure, for instance, using a Fischer projection.\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (C2 is R)\n        ------|------  (Plane of symmetry)\n      CH3 ---|--- H    (C3 is S)\n              |\n             COOH\n        ```\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   A compound with chiral centers but also an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** (meso) and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The stereochemistry is (2R, 3R).\n    *   Let's draw its Fischer projection:\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (C2 is R)\n              |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (C3 is R)\n              |\n             COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer.\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with an alcohol group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        2.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        3.  -CH2-CH= (path towards C2)\n        4.  -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6)\n    *   Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor 's' in this context implies that the substituents have the same relative stereochemistry (all cis). This means all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring's plane.\n    *   Let's check for chirality at C1. The groups are H, OH, and two paths around the ring: -CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2- and -CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-. These two paths are identical. Therefore, C1 is not a chiral center. By symmetry, C3 and C5 are also not chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the ring, with C2 and C6 being mirror images, and C3 and C5 being mirror images. Since C3 and C5 are identically substituted, this is a valid plane of symmetry. In fact, the molecule has three such planes of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. The C5H9 group is a cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers. A carbon atom needs to be sp3 hybridized and bonded to four different groups.\n    *   In the butane chain: The carbonyl carbon is sp2. C2 is a -CH2- group. C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl (-CH3) groups. So, C3 is not chiral.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring: Every carbon is a -CH2- group, except for the one attached to the carbonyl. This carbon is bonded to the carbonyl chain, a hydrogen, and two -CH2- groups within the ring. The ring is unsubstituted, so the paths around the ring are identical. Thus, no carbon in the ring is chiral.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and is not of a type that exhibits chirality without one. It is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n- (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
