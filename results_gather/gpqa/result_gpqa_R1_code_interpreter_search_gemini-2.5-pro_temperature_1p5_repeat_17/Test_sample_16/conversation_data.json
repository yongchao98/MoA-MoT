    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The problem involves the dissociation of the calcium-EDTA complex ([Ca-EDTA]^2-). The complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium (Ca^2+) and EDTA (in its fully deprotonated form, EDTA^4-, because the pH is assumed to be ideal for complexation, which is typically pH > 10). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n    *   Formation: `Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- <=> [Ca-EDTA]^2-`\n    *   Dissociation: `[Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-`\n\n2.  **Use the given formation constant (K_f) to find the dissociation constant (K_d):** The problem provides the formation constant, `K_Ca-EDTA` (also denoted as `K_f`), which is `5 x 10^10`.\n\n    `K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-])`\n\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (`K_d`) is the inverse of the formation constant.\n\n    `K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10^10) = 2 x 10^-11`\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) for the dissociation reaction:** Let `x` be the concentration of `Ca^2+` that forms at equilibrium.\n\n    | Species | [Ca-EDTA]^2- | Ca^2+ | EDTA^4- |\n    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n    | **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M | 0 M | 0 M |\n    | **Change (C)** | -x | +x | +x |\n    | **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x | x | x |\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation and solve for x:**\n\n    `K_d = ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]`\n\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n\n    `2 x 10^-11 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation using an approximation:** Because the formation constant `K_f` is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right for formation, meaning the complex is very stable and dissociates very little. Therefore, `x` will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation:\n\n    `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`\n\n    The simplified equation becomes:\n\n    `2 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02`\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of x:**\n\n    `x^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-11) * 0.02`\n    `x^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13`\n    `x = sqrt(4 x 10^-13)`\n    `x = sqrt(40 x 10^-14)`\n    `x = 6.324... x 10^-7 M`\n\n7.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, `[Ca^2+]`, is `x`. Rounding the result gives `6.3 x 10^-7 M`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
