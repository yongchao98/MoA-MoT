    "Here's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The desired product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down the structure and the relative positions of the substituents on the benzene ring:\n    *   Position 1: -OEt (ethoxy group), an ortho,para-director and strong activator.\n    *   Position 2: -tBu (tert-butyl group), an ortho,para-director and weak activator.\n    *   Position 3: -NO2 (nitro group), a meta-director and strong deactivator.\n\n    The relative positions are:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Synthesis Strategy:**\n    Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring like this is often challenging due to competing directing effects. The meta-relationship between the powerful activating group (-OEt) and the deactivating group (-NO2) is a major clue. It suggests that one of these groups was likely introduced when a meta-director was already present, or that the powerful o,p-directing effect of the -OEt group was somehow overcome or blocked.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Option Step-by-Step:**\n    The question asks for a \"high-yield synthesis\". This means we should look for chemically sound reactions that are known to proceed efficiently and with good regioselectivity. We will start from benzene and follow the sequence for each option.\n\n    *   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n        *   i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene. (Correct Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n        *   ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene -> Mainly p-tert-butylnitrobenzene.\n        *   iii) Sulfonation of p-tert-butylnitrobenzene -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is used for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) does not have an amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible.\n        *   **Conclusion: Option A is chemically incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n        *   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> Aniline.\n        *   iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. This reaction is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is also a strong Lewis base and reacts with the basic amino group of aniline. This forms a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack, preventing the alkylation. For a high-yield synthesis, the amino group must be protected first (e.g., by acetylation). Since this step is not mentioned, the reaction as written would fail or give very poor yields.\n        *   **Conclusion: Option C is not a viable high-yield synthesis.**\n\n    *   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n        *   Let's trace the synthesis up to the problematic step.\n        *   i) tert-Butylbenzene.\n        *   ii) Sulfonation -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. (Excellent use of a blocking group).\n        *   iii) Nitration -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Excellent regiocontrol).\n        *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) -> Diazonium salt of the previous product.\n        *   vi) The substrate is now a diazonium salt. Reacting it with a nitrating mixture (`HNO3/H2SO4`) is not a standard or plausible reaction. Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates, typically used immediately for replacement reactions (e.g., with H2O, CuX, HBF4), not as substrates for further electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n        *   **Conclusion: Option D is chemically incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; ...**\n        *   i) Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n        *   ii) Nitration -> The major product is **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**. Let's follow the major product path for a high-yield synthesis.\n        *   iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n        *   iv) Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. This is a key step. The amino group is a strong o,p-director, as is the tert-butyl group. However, in the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. We have a t-Bu group (o,p-director) at C1 and an -NH3+ group (m-director) at C4.\n            *   t-Bu at C1 directs to positions 2 and 6.\n            *   -NH3+ at C4 directs to positions 2 and 6.\n            *   The directing effects reinforce each other, leading to nitration at position 2 (or 6). The product after workup is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n        *   v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) of the amino group -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenyldiazonium salt**.\n        *   vi) Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (H3O+, heat) -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n        *   vii) Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) -> **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   This sequence (i-vii) is chemically plausible and leads to a specific isomer. However, this isomer is not the target molecule named in the question. The remaining steps, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, simply add and then remove a sulfonic acid group, which is a pointless loop.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Options A, C, and D contain steps that are chemically impossible or would result in very low yields. They represent flawed synthetic pathways.\n    Option B, while not leading to the precisely named target molecule and containing two superfluous steps at the end, describes a sequence of reactions (i-vii) that is chemically logical and sound. It represents a valid synthesis for an isomer of the target. Given the choices, Option B is the only one that describes a sequence of largely correct chemical transformations. It is common in such problems that the intended answer is the only chemically plausible route, even if the question itself has flaws (incorrect product name or extra steps).\n\nTherefore, Option B is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
