    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent ring is benzene.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are meta to each other.\n*   Let's analyze the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n    *   Acetyl group (-COCH3): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   Bromo group (-Br): Deactivating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   Nitro group (-NO2): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate a Direct Synthesis Route**\n\nA simple, direct synthesis might involve introducing the three groups one by one. Let's consider the possible orders.\n\n*   **Path 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position (C3). This works well.\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In 3-nitroacetophenone, we have two meta-directing groups (-COCH3 at C1, -NO2 at C3). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position C5. This step is regiochemically perfect. However, the ring is very strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, making the reaction extremely slow or requiring very harsh conditions.\n\n*   **Path 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene -> Acetophenone (-COCH3, m-director).\n    2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 directs Br to C3). This works.\n    3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone -> Now we have a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH3 group directs nitration to C5. The -Br group directs nitration to C2, C4, and C6. This leads to a mixture of products, so it's not a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Other direct paths fail:** Starting with nitration or bromination and then attempting Friedel-Crafts acylation is problematic. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings deactivated by a nitro group. Acylation of bromobenzene would give a mixture of ortho and para products, not the required meta isomer.\n\nSince the direct routes are either low-yield or do not work, a more complex strategy is needed. The options provided are all 7 steps long and include reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl) and subsequent removal of the resulting amino group (NaNO2/HCl followed by H3PO2). This is a classic \"directing group\" strategy where an amino group is used to control regiochemistry and then removed.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Provided Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step. The key steps that often fail are Friedel-Crafts reactions on deactivated rings or anilines.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4\n    *   i) Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Aniline\n    *   iii) Benzenediazonium chloride\n    *   iv) Benzene. This sequence is circular and gets back to the starting material. This option is incorrect as written.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    *   i) Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Aniline\n    *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempt on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the acylation reaction. This step is not feasible. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    *   i) Bromobenzene\n    *   ii) p-Nitrobromobenzene (major product).\n    *   iii) p-Nitrobromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring containing a nitro group. The ring is strongly deactivated, and this reaction will not proceed. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    1.  **i) Benzene --(Acylation)--> Acetophenone.** This is a standard and effective reaction. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone --(Bromination)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The m-directing acetyl group directs bromine to position 3. This is a clean reaction.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone --(Nitration)--> 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone.** As discussed in point 2, nitration gives a mixture, but the ortho/para directing effect of the bromine often leads to substitution at C4 or C6. Let's assume the synthesis proceeds via the 4-nitro isomer.\n    4.  **iv) 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone --(Reduction with Fe/HCl)--> 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone.** The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amino group.\n    5.  **v) 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone --(Nitration)--> 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.** Now the ring contains a strongly activating, o,p-directing amino group at C4. This group's directing effect will overwhelm all others. It directs the new nitro group to its ortho positions (C3 and C5). C3 is blocked by bromine, so nitration occurs exclusively at C5. This step is highly regioselective and is the key to establishing the 1,3,5 pattern.\n    6.  **vi) 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone --(Diazotization with NaNO2/HCl)-->** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    7.  **vii) ... --(Deamination with H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom, leaving the desired product.\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound, uses standard reactions, and employs a clever strategy to achieve the difficult 1,3,5-substitution pattern with high regioselectivity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the directing effects and the feasibility of each reaction step, we can conclude that option C represents a logical and viable synthetic pathway to the target molecule, while the other options contain steps that are either incorrect or would not proceed as written.\n\n<<<C>>>"
