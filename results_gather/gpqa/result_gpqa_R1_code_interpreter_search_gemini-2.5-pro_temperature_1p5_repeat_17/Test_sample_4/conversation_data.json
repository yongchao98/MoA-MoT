    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the operators:**\n    The problem provides the Cartesian components of the momentum operator $\\vec{P}$ in a 2-dimensional Hilbert space. These are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$.\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    The operator can be written compactly as $\\vec{P} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\vec{\\sigma}$. This is the standard spin operator, often denoted by $\\vec{S}$.\n\n2.  **Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The problem asks for the eigenvector of the operator along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by a single angle $\\theta$. In spherical coordinates, with $\\theta$ as the polar angle (angle from the z-axis) and $\\phi$ as the azimuthal angle (angle from the x-axis in the x-y plane), a vector in the x-z plane corresponds to $\\phi=0$.\n    The components of the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ are:\n    $n_x = \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi = \\sin\\theta$\n    $n_y = \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$\n    $n_z = \\cos\\theta$\n    So, $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the operator $P_n$:**\n    The operator for the component of $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x)(\\sin\\theta) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y)(0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z)(\\cos\\theta)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, substitute the matrices for $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the eigenvalue equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $\\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n \\psi = \\lambda \\psi$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the eigenvector components:**\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    From the first equation:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    This gives the ratio of the components:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    Using the trigonometric half-angle identities $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    (We can verify that the second equation gives the same relationship).\n\n    So, the eigenvector is of the form $\\psi = C \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $C$. To avoid fractions, we can write it as:\n    $\\psi = C' \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Normalize the eigenvector:**\n    The normalization condition requires the squared magnitude of the eigenvector to be 1: $\\psi^\\dagger \\psi = 1$. For a real vector, this is $a^2 + b^2 = 1$.\n    $|C'|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x = 1$:\n    $|C'|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C'|=1$.\n    We can choose the simplest phase, $C'=1$.\n    The normalized eigenvector is $\\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
