    "I need to determine the minimum redshift required for the Lyman-alpha line of hydrogen to be observable by a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength ($\\lambda_0$)**: The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest-frame wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This is in the far-ultraviolet part of the spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff**: The Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone (O3), is opaque to ultraviolet radiation. Ground-based telescopes can only observe light that penetrates this atmospheric window. The short-wavelength (blue/UV) cutoff for ground-based astronomy is approximately 3600 Å. Wavelengths shorter than this are strongly absorbed and do not reach the ground. Therefore, for the Lyα line to be detected, it must be redshifted to a wavelength of at least 3600 Å.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation**: The redshift, *z*, relates the rest-frame wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) to the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) by the formula:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_0 \\times (1 + z)$\n\n    We want to find the minimum redshift (*z*) that makes the Lyα line observable. So, we set the observed wavelength to the minimum possible value, which is the atmospheric cutoff:\n    *   $\\lambda_0 = 1216$ Å\n    *   $\\lambda_{obs, min} = 3600$ Å\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for *z*:\n    $1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_0} - 1$\n\n4.  **Calculation**:\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $z = \\frac{3600 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}} - 1$\n    $z \\approx 2.96 - 1$\n    $z \\approx 1.96$\n\n    To be slightly more generous and account for the difficulty of observing right at the atmospheric cutoff, a redshift of around 2 or slightly higher is a practical lower limit. Looking at the options provided, 1.9 is the closest value to this calculated limit.\n\n    *   At a redshift of z = 1.9, the observed wavelength would be:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1 + 1.9) = 1216 \\times 2.9 = 3526.4$ Å.\n        This is just below the typical cutoff, but within a reasonable range for estimation, as the cutoff is not perfectly sharp.\n\n    *   Let's check the next highest option, z = 2.4:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1 + 2.4) = 1216 \\times 3.4 = 4134.4$ Å.\n        This is well within the observable optical range.\n\nThe question asks for the *lower limit*. A redshift of 1.9 brings the Lyα line to the very edge of the atmospheric window, making it the minimum redshift required for potential detection.\n\n<<<B>>>"
