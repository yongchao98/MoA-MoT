    "An oscillating charge distribution that maintains a certain shape, like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis, can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when the size of the distribution is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation it produces (`d << λ`). This is a fundamental model in classical electromagnetism.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Model:**\n    The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution confined to a spheroid, with oscillations along its symmetry axis (let's call it the z-axis). This setup creates a time-varying electric dipole moment `p(t)` along the z-axis. The radiation produced by such a source is known as electric dipole radiation.\n\n2.  **Angular Distribution of Radiated Power:**\n    For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the radiation zone is given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency and the magnitude of the dipole moment, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Maximum Power:**\n    The power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`, is maximum when the `sin²(θ)` term is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    The maximum radiated power, given as `A`, is:\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`\n    So, the constant `C` is equal to the maximum power `A`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Power at `θ = 30°`:**\n    We need to find the fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We use the same formula, substituting `C = A` and `θ = 30°`:\n    `(dP/dΩ) at 30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n    We know the value of `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    So, the power radiated at 30° is:\n    `(dP/dΩ) at 30° = A * (1/4) = A/4`\n    The fraction of `A` radiated at this angle is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Wavelength Dependence:**\n    Now, let's look at the functional form of `f`, specifically its dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The constant `C` in the formula `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)` is not truly constant; it depends on the frequency `ω` of oscillation. The full formula for the time-averaged power is:\n    `dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\n    Here, `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `ω` is the angular frequency, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    The radiated power is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the expression `ω = 2πv = 2π(c/λ)`, where `v` is the frequency.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    This means the function `f(λ, θ)` representing the power per unit solid angle has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence. This is the famous inverse fourth power law responsible for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining our findings:\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   A possible form for the function `f` includes a dependence of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    Matching these results with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    B) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    C) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n    D) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n\n    Option A is the only one that matches both results.\n\n<<<A>>>"
