    "1.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. \"Racemic\" means it's a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is at carbon 3.\n    *   **Catalyst:** Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a self-metathesis reaction of a single alkene. The general reaction for a terminal alkene (R-CH=CH₂) is:\n        2 R-CH=CH₂  ⇌  R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n    *   The question asks for the number of products excluding ethene. So we need to analyze the stereoisomers of the main product, R-CH=CH-R.\n\n2.  **Identify the Product Structure:**\n    *   The 'R' group from 3-methylpent-1-ene is the *sec*-butyl group, specifically a (3-methylpentan-2-yl) group if we are being pedantic, but it's the CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃ part. For simplicity, let's call the chiral reactant `Alk`.\n    *   The product molecule is `Alk-CH=CH-Alk`.\n    *   Substituting the structure: [CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)]-CH=CH-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃].\n    *   The systematic name is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n3.  **Consider the Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The starting material is a mixture of (R)-`Alk` and (S)-`Alk`.\n    *   Three types of couplings can occur in the reaction mixture:\n        a.  (R)-`Alk` + (R)-`Alk`  (homocoupling)\n        b.  (S)-`Alk` + (S)-`Alk`  (homocoupling)\n        c.  (R)-`Alk` + (S)-`Alk`  (cross-coupling)\n    *   The product, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers (at C3 and C6) and a new double bond (at C4) that can have E or Z geometry. We need to analyze the stereoisomers formed from each coupling.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Products from Each Coupling:**\n\n    *   **a. (R) + (R) coupling:**\n        *   This forms (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n        *   This product can exist as two geometric isomers:\n            *   (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n            *   (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        *   This coupling produces **2** chiral products.\n\n    *   **b. (S) + (S) coupling:**\n        *   This forms (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n        *   This also exists as two geometric isomers:\n            *   (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral). This is the enantiomer of the (E)-(3R, 6R) product.\n            *   (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral). This is the enantiomer of the (Z)-(3R, 6R) product.\n        *   This coupling produces **2** more chiral products.\n\n    *   **c. (R) + (S) coupling:**\n        *   This forms (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (note: this is the same as (3S, 6R) by IUPAC rules).\n        *   We must analyze the stereochemistry of the E and Z isomers separately.\n        *   **(E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule has two opposite chiral centers and a C=C bond in the E configuration. It possesses a center of inversion, which makes it an achiral **meso compound**. (1 achiral product)\n        *   **(Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation but no plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is **chiral**. Since the catalyst and reaction conditions are achiral, a chiral product must be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers). So, this reaction forms both (Z)-(3R, 6S) and its enantiomer (Z)-(3S, 6R). (**2** chiral products).\n\n5.  **Count the Total Number of Products:**\n    *   Let's sum up all the unique stereoisomers formed:\n        *   From (R)+(R): 2 chiral products\n        *   From (S)+(S): 2 chiral products (the enantiomers of the R+R products)\n        *   From (R)+(S): 1 achiral meso product + 2 chiral products (an enantiomeric pair)\n    *   Total distinct products = 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7.\n\n6.  **Re-evaluate based on the multiple-choice options:**\n    *   The rigorous analysis gives 7 possible products (stereoisomers). However, 7 is not an option. This implies the question uses a specific convention or might be flawed. Let's analyze the options.\n    *   **A) 8:** This would be the maximum number of stereoisomers if there were no meso compounds (2³ = 8).\n    *   **B) 4:** This would be the number of separable fractions using achiral chromatography (1 meso compound + 3 racemic pairs). This is a plausible interpretation.\n    *   **C) 2:** This is too low.\n    *   **D) 6:** Let's see how we can arrive at 6.\n        *   **Hypothesis 1: The question asks for the number of *chiral* products.** From our analysis above, we have 6 chiral products and 1 achiral (meso) product. If we exclude the meso compound, the count is 6.\n        *   **Hypothesis 2: The question author made a common error.** A quick, but flawed, calculation is: 3 coupling types (RR, SS, RS) × 2 geometries (E, Z) = 6 products. This ignores the nuances of stereoisomerism but directly yields 6.\n        *   **Hypothesis 3: An inconsistent counting method.** Count each enantiomer for the homodimers (4 products) plus the meso heterodimer (1 product) plus the Z-heterodimer racemate as a single entity (1 product). This gives 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n    *   Given the context of chemistry problems, asking for the number of chiral products is a reasonable (though subtly phrased) question. This interpretation neatly explains why 6 is an option and the correct answer of 7 is not. The reaction is notable for producing one achiral meso compound amongst a sea of chiral isomers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction produces a total of 7 stereoisomeric products. One of these is an achiral meso compound, and the other six are chiral. Since 7 is not an option, and 6 is, the most logical interpretation is that the question is asking for the number of **chiral** products.\n\n*   **Chiral products:**\n    1.  (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    2.  (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    3.  (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    4.  (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    5.  (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n    6.  (Z)-(3S, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n*   **Achiral product:**\n    1.  (E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n\nTotal chiral products = 6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
