    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental scenario.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the experiment:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (delivered orally). Rotavirus is a gut pathogen.\n    *   **Location:** The gut, specifically the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs crucial for initiating mucosal immunity.\n    *   **Observation 1:** The antigen is detected in Peyer's patches.\n    *   **Observation 2:** A cell population in these patches is proliferating. This indicates an active immune response, likely the formation of a germinal center.\n    *   **Observation 3 (Key Finding):** Sequencing the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating cells reveals *high variability*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the options in the context of the key finding:** The question is about what process causes high variability in the *variable region* of the heavy chain gene *after* antigen encounter in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process alters the *constant region* of the heavy chain, changing the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in mucosal responses). It does *not* introduce variability into the *variable region*, which is responsible for antigen binding. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that specifically occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the DNA sequences encoding the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This process is the basis for affinity maturation, where B cells producing higher-affinity antibodies are selected for survival. This directly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating cell population.\n\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system and the humoral response effector functions. It involves a cascade of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve any genetic alteration of B cells. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially creates a diverse repertoire of B cell receptors. It occurs in *developing* B cells in the *primary lymphoid organs* (bone marrow) *before* they encounter any antigen. While it generates initial diversity, the process described in the question is happening in mature B cells *after* antigen stimulation in a secondary lymphoid organ, leading to a further increase in variability within a specific responding population. The process that fine-tunes the antigen-binding site after initial VDJ recombination is SHM.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in the Peyer's patch after encountering an antigen is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
