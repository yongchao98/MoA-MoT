    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Limiting Shape of the Aperture:**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. We are asked to consider the case where N becomes infinitely large (N -> ∞).\n    For a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is the radius of its inscribed circle. The distance from the center to a vertex is the circumradius, R. The relationship between them is `a = R * cos(π/N)`.\n    As N -> ∞, the angle π/N -> 0. Since cos(0) = 1, the circumradius R approaches the apothem 'a' (R -> a). This means the distance from the center to any point on the perimeter of the polygon approaches 'a'.\n    Therefore, an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a **circle of radius 'a'** as N becomes infinitely large.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Phenomenon:**\n    The problem involves monochromatic light passing through an aperture and observing the intensity pattern in the far-field region. This is a classic case of **Fraunhofer diffraction**. We need to find the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture.\n\n3.  **Recall the Theory of Diffraction by a Circular Aperture (Airy Pattern):**\n    The far-field diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n    The intensity `I` at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n    where:\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n    *   `J₁(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center (θ=0).\n\n4.  **Determine the Positions of the Minima:**\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur where the numerator `J₁(k * a * sinθ)` is equal to zero (excluding the case where the denominator is also zero, which happens at θ=0).\n    So, the condition for the minima is:\n    `k * a * sinθ = z`\n    where `z` are the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\n5.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function J₁(x):**\n    The zeros of `J₁(x)` are well-known values. The first two positive zeros are approximately:\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    Using the small angle approximation (`sinθ ≈ θ`), the condition for the minima becomes:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θ = z`\n    Solving for `θ`:\n    `θ = z * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n    *   **First minimum (θ₁):**\n        `θ₁ = z₁ * λ / (2π * a) = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n    *   **Second minimum (θ₂):**\n        `θ₂ = z₂ * λ / (2π * a) = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    The angular distance `Δθ` is the difference between the angular positions of the second and first minima:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n    `Δθ = [z₂ * λ / (2π * a)] - [z₁ * λ / (2π * a)]`\n    `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n    Now, substitute the values of the zeros:\n    `Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n    To find the numerical coefficient, we calculate `3.1839 / (2π)`:\n    `3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...) ≈ 0.5067`\n\n    So, the angular distance is approximately:\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ / a`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's check the options provided:\n    A) 0.500 λ / a\n    B) 0.506 λ / a\n    C) 1.220 λ / a\n    D) 0.610 λ / a\n\n    Our calculated value `0.5067 * λ / a` is in excellent agreement with option B.\n\n    *(Self-check: Option D, 0.610 λ / a, corresponds to the angular position of the first minimum, `θ₁ = 3.8317 / (2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 * λ/a`. Option C, 1.220 λ / a, corresponds to the angular diameter of the central Airy disk, `2θ₁`. This confirms our understanding of the problem and the meaning of the different numerical factors.)*\n\nTo confirm the numerical calculation with high precision, we can use a script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# The problem is about Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n# The minima are given by k * a * sin(theta) = z_n, where z_n are the zeros of the Bessel function J1.\n# For small angles, sin(theta) ~ theta, and k = 2*pi/lambda.\n# So, (2*pi/lambda) * a * theta_n = z_n  => theta_n = z_n * lambda / (2 * pi * a)\n\n# We need the angular distance between the first two minima, delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1.\n# delta_theta = (z_2 - z_1) * lambda / (2 * pi * a)\n\n# We need to find the coefficient (z_2 - z_1) / (2 * pi).\n# We use scipy to get the first two positive zeros of J1(x).\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nz1 = zeros[0]\nz2 = zeros[1]\n\n# Calculate the coefficient\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.5067718911143831\n</execute_output>\nThe code confirms that the coefficient is approximately 0.5068, which matches option B when rounded to three decimal places.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides N approaches infinity. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle in this limit.\n\nThe problem then reduces to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`. The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular positions `θ` of the intensity minima (dark rings) are given by the formula:\n`sin(θ) = z / (k * a)`\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, given by `k = 2π / λ`, where `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `z` are the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. So, the angular positions of the minima are:\n`θ = z / (k * a) = z * λ / (2π * a)`\n\nTo find the angular positions of the first two minima, we need the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. These are well-known values:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (`θ₁`) is:\n`θ₁ = z₁ * λ / (2π * a) = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 0.610 * λ / a`\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`) is:\n`θ₂ = z₂ * λ / (2π * a) = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 1.116 * λ / a`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ * λ / (2π * a)) - (z₁ * λ / (2π * a))`\n`Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2π * a)`\n\nNow, we substitute the values of the zeros:\n`Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)`\n`Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)`\n\nTo find the numerical coefficient, we calculate `3.1839 / (2π)`:\n`coefficient = 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...) ≈ 0.5067`\n\nSo, the angular distance is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ / a`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nOur calculated value `0.5067 * λ / a` is closest to `0.506 * λ / a`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
