    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for the probability of a sequence of two quantum measurements.\nFirst, observable P is measured on an initial state, and we want the outcome to be 0.\nSecond, immediately after the first measurement, observable Q is measured on the new state, and we want the outcome to be -1.\nThe total probability is the product of the probability of the first event and the conditional probability of the second event, given the first occurred.\n`Prob(P=0 and Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | state after P=0)`\n\n**2. Define the State and Operators:**\n*   Initial unnormalized state vector: `|ψ_un⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   Operator P:\n    ```\n    P = [[0,      1/√2,     0],\n         [1/√2,   0,      1/√2],\n         [0,      1/√2,     0]]\n    ```\n*   Operator Q:\n    ```\n    Q = [[1,  0,  0],\n         [0,  0,  0],\n         [0,  0, -1]]\n    ```\n\n**3. Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n**Step A: Normalize the Initial State**\nA state vector must be normalized (have a length of 1) for probability calculations.\n*   Calculate the squared norm (magnitude): `||ψ_un||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n*   The normalization constant is `1 / √6`.\n*   The normalized state is `|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Probability of Measuring P=0**\nThe probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector of P for the eigenvalue λ=0:** We need to solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`, where `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]^T` is the eigenvector.\n    ```\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n    ```\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    1.  `y/√2 = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` => `x = -z`\n    The eigenvector has the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We can choose `x=1` for a simple representation: `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n*   **Normalize this eigenvector:** The squared norm is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`. The normalization factor is `1/√2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector for `P=0` is `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n*   **Calculate the probability `Prob(P=0)`:**\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ⟩|²`\n    The term `⟨p_0|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the eigenvector `|p_0⟩` and the state `|ψ⟩`.\n    `⟨p_0|ψ⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] · [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T]`\n    `⟨p_0|ψ⟩ = (1/√2) * (1/√6) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n    `⟨p_0|ψ⟩ = (1/√12) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n    Now, square the magnitude:\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\n**Step C: Determine the State After the First Measurement**\nWhen a measurement is made, the system's state \"collapses\" into the eigenvector corresponding to the measured value.\n*   Since the outcome of the P measurement was 0, the new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is the normalized eigenvector `|p_0⟩`.\n*   New state: `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step D: Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q=-1 from the New State**\nNow we repeat the process, but using the new state `|ψ'⟩` and the operator Q.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector of Q for the eigenvalue λ=-1:** The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (`1, 0, -1`), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    The eigenvector for `Q=-1` is `|q_{-1}⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`. It is already normalized.\n*   **Calculate the probability `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩)`:**\n    `Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] · [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T]`\n    `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))`\n    `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = -1/√2`\n    Now, square the magnitude:\n    `Prob(Q=-1) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`.\n\n**Step E: Calculate the Final Joint Probability**\nThe probability of the sequence of events is the product of the individual probabilities calculated.\n*   `Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 from state |ψ'⟩)`\n*   `Prob(total) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
