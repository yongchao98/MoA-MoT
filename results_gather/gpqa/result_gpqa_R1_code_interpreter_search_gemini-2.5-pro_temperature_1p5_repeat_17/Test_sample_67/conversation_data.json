    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The system consists of a spin-1/2 particle.\n    *   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`.\n    *   A magnetic field `B` is applied in the +Z direction, so `B_vec = B * z_hat`.\n    *   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B_vec = -γS_z * B`.\n    *   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state.\n    *   The energy levels are determined by the eigenvalues of `S_z`, which are `+ħ/2` (spin up, `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (spin down, `|-z>`). The corresponding energies are `E = -γB * m_s`, where `m_s` is the spin eigenvalue.\n        *   If `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is for `S_z = +ħ/2`. The initial state is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. The magnetic moment `μ_z = γ(ħ/2)` is positive, so it's aligned with `B` in the +Z direction.\n        *   If `γ < 0`, the lowest energy state is for `S_z = -ħ/2`. The initial state is `|ψ(0)> = |-z>`. The magnetic moment `μ_z = γ(-ħ/2)` is positive (since γ is negative), so it's also aligned with `B` in the +Z direction.\n    *   For simplicity, let's proceed assuming `γ > 0`, so the initial state is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. We will see that the result is independent of this choice.\n    *   The initial expectation value of the spin components are: `<S_x>(0) = 0`, `<S_y>(0) = 0`, `<S_z>(0) = +ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **Understand the New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\n    *   The new magnetic field vector is `B_vec' = B * y_hat`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -μ ⋅ B_vec' = -γ(S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z) = -γB * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the Expectation Value:**\n    *   The time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` is governed by the Ehrenfest theorem, which for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field simplifies to a classical-like precession equation:\n        `d<S>/dt = γ (<S> x B_vec')`\n    *   Let's write this out for each component, with `B_vec' = (0, B, 0)`:\n        *   `d<S_x>/dt = γ (<S_y>B_z' - <S_z>B_y') = γ (0 - <S_z>B) = -γB<S_z>`\n        *   `d<S_y>/dt = γ (<S_z>B_x' - <S_x>B_z') = γ (0 - 0) = 0`\n        *   `d<S_z>/dt = γ (<S_x>B_y' - <S_y>B_x') = γ (<S_x>B - 0) = γB<S_x>`\n\n4.  **Solve the Equations of Motion:**\n    *   From `d<S_y>/dt = 0`, we know `<S_y>(t)` is a constant. Since `<S_y>(0) = 0`, we have `<S_y>(t) = 0` for all time.\n    *   We have a coupled system for `<S_x>` and `<S_z>`:\n        1.  `d<S_z>/dt = γB<S_x>`\n        2.  `d<S_x>/dt = -γB<S_z>`\n    *   To solve this, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n        `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * d<S_x>/dt`\n    *   Now substitute the second equation into this:\n        `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * (-γB<S_z>) = -(γB)²<S_z>`\n    *   This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n    *   The solution for `<S_z>(t)` is of the form `A*cos(ωt) + C*sin(ωt)`.\n        *   Using the initial condition `<S_z>(0) = ħ/2`, we get `A = ħ/2`.\n        *   Using the initial condition `d<S_z>/dt` at t=0, which is `γB<S_x>(0) = γB * 0 = 0`, we get `C = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, the time evolution of the z-component of the spin is:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos((γB)t)`\n\n5.  **Find the Oscillation Frequency of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    *   The average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`.\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos((γB)t)`.\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n    *   By comparing `cos((γB)t)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can directly identify the oscillation frequency.\n    *   The angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\n(Note: If we had chosen `γ < 0`, the initial state would be `|-z>`, so `<S_z>(0) = -ħ/2`. The final result would be `<S_z>(t) = (-ħ/2)cos((γB)t)`, and `<μ_z>(t) = γ(-ħ/2)cos((γB)t)`. The amplitude changes, but the oscillation frequency `γB` remains the same.)\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the applied magnetic field at the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`. The z-component of the spin therefore oscillates at this frequency.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency is `γB`, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
