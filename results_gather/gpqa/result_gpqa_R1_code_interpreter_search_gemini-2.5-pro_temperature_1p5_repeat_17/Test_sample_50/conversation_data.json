    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n1.  **Introduction to the Method of Images**\n    When a point charge `q` is placed near a grounded conducting sphere, it induces charges on the surface of the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is complex to calculate directly from the induced charge distribution. The \"method of images\" provides a powerful simplification. We can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere, such that the combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` creates a potential of zero on the spherical surface (which was originally the surface of the grounded conductor).\n\n2.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Location**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), the equivalent image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge location: `b = R^2 / d`\n    The image charge lies on the same line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` at any point is due to the attraction from the induced charges on the sphere. This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    A simpler way to calculate the potential energy of the system is using the formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `q` is the real charge.\n    *   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the real charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    *   The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the induced charges are not a fixed source of energy; their existence and distribution depend on the presence of the charge `q`. The total energy is half the interaction energy of the charge with the field it creates.\n\n4.  **Calculating V_induced**\n    The potential `V_induced` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n    *   The position of the real charge `q` is `d` from the center.\n    *   The position of the image charge `q'` is `b` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Now substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `q' = -qR/d`\n    `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    So, the potential is:\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation of Potential Energy (U)**\n    Now, we plug `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Comparing with the Options**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    This matches option C.\n\n    *   A) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   B) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
