    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate will act as the nucleophile.\n    *   The ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is the electrophile, specifically a Michael acceptor. The attack will occur at the β-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the site of deprotonation (enolate formation):**\n    *   The structure of the ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    ```\n       O\n      //\n    C1--C2(Et)(Me)\n   /  \\\n  C6(Me)-C5\n  |    |\n  C4---C3\n    ```\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **Carbon C2:** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C1, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **Carbon C6:** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and a hydrogen). It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, deprotonation must occur at this position. The base t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C6, forming the corresponding enolate. There is only one possible regioisomer for the enolate.\n\n4.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate, with the nucleophilic character at C6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack, the resulting intermediate enolate (from the acrylate moiety) is protonated during the workup step to give the final product.\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n    ```\n           O\n          //\n        C1--C2(Et)(Me)\n       /  \\\n(Me)C6----C5\n      |    |\n      C4---C3\n      |\n     CH₂\n     |\n     CH₂\n     |\n     COOEt\n    ```\n\n5.  **Name the product A:**\n    The options provide names where the ester is the parent compound (ethyl propanoate). Let's name our product using this convention.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl 3-(...)-propanoate`. The substituent is a cyclohexyl ring attached at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, its point of attachment to the propanoate chain is numbered as C1'.\n    *   In our product, the attachment point is the original C6 of the ketone. So, C6(old) -> C1'(new).\n        *   C1' has a methyl group (from the starting material). This gives `1'-methyl`.\n    *   The original carbonyl carbon C1 becomes C2' in the substituent name. This gives `2'-oxo`.\n    *   The original quaternary carbon C2 becomes C3' in the substituent name. It has an ethyl and a methyl group. This gives `3'-ethyl` and `3'-methyl`.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named `(3'-ethyl-1',3'-dimethyl-2'-oxocyclohexyl)`. (The primes are just for clarity here, they are not used in the final name).\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor), and a base (KOH). This is also a Michael addition reaction. The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-protons on the nitroalkane acidic enough to be removed by KOH.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The base, KOH, will deprotonate the 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) at the α-carbon (the carbon bearing the nitro group) to form a nitro-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate). This is the nucleophile.\n        `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻  ->  CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂ + H₂O`\n    *   The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`N≡C¹-C²H=C³H-C⁴H₃`), a Michael acceptor. The attack occurs at the β-carbon (C3).\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`) attacks the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product.\n    *   Let's trace the backbone formation:\n        `(CH₃CH₂)(NO₂)CH-` from 1-nitropropane connects to `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN` from but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The final product structure is:\n        ```\n             NO₂   CH₃\n             |     |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH - CH - CH₂ - CN\n        ```\n\n4.  **Name the product B:**\n    *   We use IUPAC nomenclature. The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long. So, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile carbon:\n        ```\n              C6  C5   C4      C3      C2    C1\n             CH₃-CH₂ - CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃) - CH₂ - CN\n        ```\n    *   Identify and locate the substituents:\n        *   There is a methyl group (`-CH₃`) on C3.\n        *   There is a nitro group (`-NO₂`) on C4.\n    *   The full name of product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing this pair with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile** (This matches our findings)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect structures for both A and B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect structure for B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect structure for A)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
