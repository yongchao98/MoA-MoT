    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`. In the presence of a base (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)CH=CHCOOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic carbon for Michael addition is the β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form an enolate intermediate from the acrylate portion.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   Reactants: `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CβH=CαH-COOCH₃` and `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   The new bond forms between the β-carbon of the acrylate and the central carbon of the malonate.\n    *   Structure after attack and protonation: `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n\n4.  **Match the Structure with the Given Names:**\n    *   Let's analyze the name from option B: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n    *   Let's deconstruct this name to draw the structure:\n        *   The parent chain is a propane with three trimethyl carboxylate groups (`-COOCH₃`).\n        *   The locants `1,1,3` indicate the positions of these carboxylate groups. However, a `C1-C2-C3` propane chain cannot have a substituent at position 3 and also two at position 1. This name seems to be based on a parent tricarboxylic acid, `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid`.\n        *   Let's build the structure based on connectivity: A central carbon (`C2`) is bonded to a p-tolyl group. This `C2` is also bonded to a `CH(COOCH₃)₂` group (representing `C1`) and a `CH₂(COOCH₃)` group (representing `C3`).\n        *   Structure: `(COOCH₃)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n    *   This structure matches the one we derived from the reaction mechanism: `(p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n    *   Therefore, A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophilic enolate equivalent. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine system, which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃CH=CHCN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond and generates an iminium ion on the cyclohexane ring and an anion on the butenenitrile chain.\n    *   The anion is protonated.\n    *   Finally, the acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The reaction connects C2 of the cyclohexane ring to C3 of the butanenitrile chain (`CH₃-C3H-C2H₂-C1N`).\n    *   The substituent formed from the nitrile is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The enamine is hydrolyzed to a cyclohexanone. The substituent is at position 2 (α to the new carbonyl group).\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at the C2 position.\n    *   Naming this compound with the nitrile as the principal functional group, the parent chain is butanenitrile. The substituent at position 3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, most stable tautomer.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction in Reverse (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CHCOCH₃`.\n    *   The reaction is a Michael addition. The nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂`) of MVK. After protonation, the MVK moiety becomes a `–CH₂CH₂COCH₃` group, which is a `(3-oxobutyl)` group. This matches the product description.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The `(3-oxobutyl)` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system. This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`, formed by the deprotonation of the highly acidic C2 methylene proton by KOH.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results for all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
