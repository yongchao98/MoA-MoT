    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |α>\n\nThe given state is `|α> ∝ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. We need to find the normalization constant, N, such that `<α|α> = 1`.\n\nThe state vector can be written as `|α> = N * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`.\nIn the standard basis where `|up> = [[1], [0]]` and `|down> = [[0], [1]]`, the ket `|α>` is represented by the column vector:\n`|α> = N * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\nThe corresponding bra, `<α|`, is the conjugate transpose of `|α>`:\n`<α| = N* * [<1-i, 2+i>]`\n\nThe normalization condition is `<α|α> = 1`:\n`<α|α> = |N|^2 * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ] = 1`\n`|N|^2 * [ (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) ] = 1`\n`|N|^2 * [ (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) ] = 1`\n`|N|^2 * [ 2 + 5 ] = 1`\n`|N|^2 * 7 = 1`\n`|N|^2 = 1/7`\n\nChoosing N to be a real, positive number, we get `N = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nSo, the normalized state vector is:\n`|α> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\nIn matrix form: `|α> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\n### 2. Determine the Operator Matrix A\n\nThe problem states that the operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `0` otherwise. For a 2x2 matrix (representing spin-1/2 systems), this gives:\n*   A11 = 0\n*   A22 = 0\n*   A12 = hbar/2\n*   A21 = hbar/2\n\nSo, the matrix A is:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]`\nThis can be recognized as `A = (hbar/2) * σ_x`, where `σ_x` is the Pauli-X matrix.\n\n### 3. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of A\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\n`λ² = (hbar/2)²`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `(A - λ₁I) |v₁> = 0`\n    `[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = 0`\n    This gives the equation `-a + b = 0`, which means `a = b`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[[1], [1]]`.\n    Normalizing it gives the eigenvector: `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `(A - λ₂I) |v₂> = 0`\n    `[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = 0`\n    This gives the equation `a + b = 0`, which means `a = -b`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[[1], [-1]]`.\n    Normalizing it gives the eigenvector: `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [-1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|v_i>` is given by `P(λ_i) = |<v_i|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `P(λ₁) = |<v₁|α>|²`\n    First, calculate the inner product `<v₁|α>`:\n    `<v₁|α> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1)*(1+i) + (1)*(2-i)]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1 + i + 2 - i] = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    Now, the probability is:\n    `P(λ₁) = |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14`\n    `9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `P(λ₂) = |<v₂|α>|²`\n    First, calculate the inner product `<v₂|α>`:\n    `<v₂|α> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1)*(1+i) - (1)*(2-i)]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1 + i - 2 + i] = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`\n    Now, the probability is:\n    `P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14`\n    `5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value of A\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = Σ P(λ_i) * λ_i`\n    `<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28`\n    `<A> = hbar/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the formula `<A> = <α|A|α>`**\n    `<A> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [<1-i, 2+i>] * [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `<A> = (1/7) * [<1-i, 2+i>] * [[(hbar/2)*(2-i)], [(hbar/2)*(1+i)]]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [2]`\n    `<A> = hbar/7`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar/7`. Comparing these results with the given options:\nA) 0.54, 0.46 and 3*hbar / sqrt(7)\nB) 0.61, 0.29 and 2*hbar / sqrt(7)\nC) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7\nD) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)\n\nOur results match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
