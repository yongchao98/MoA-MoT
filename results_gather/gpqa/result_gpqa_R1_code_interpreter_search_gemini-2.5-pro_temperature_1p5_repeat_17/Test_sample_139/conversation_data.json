    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Gas W:** The first critical clue is that gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Let's consider simple diatomic gases.\n    *   H₂ (Protium): Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. Total: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Protons ≠ Neutrons).\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium): Each D (²H) has 1 proton, 1 neutron. Total: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Protons = Neutrons). This is a strong candidate.\n    *   Let's consider another possibility, Deuterated Ammonia (ND₃), as it can be formed from nitrides reacting with heavy water. For ¹⁴N, we have 7 protons and 7 neutrons. For D, we have 1 proton and 1 neutron. In ND₃, Total protons = 7 + 3*(1) = 10. Total neutrons = 7 + 3*(1) = 10. (Protons = Neutrons). So, W could be D₂ or ND₃.\n\n2.  **Analyze Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C).\n    *   This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This confirms that the reaction involves deuterium and that substance B is D₂O.\n    *   Substance G is a precursor to B, formed as a precipitate. When heated, it releases D₂O. This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide (a compound that forms a hydroxide precipitate which can then be dehydrated/de-deuterated). For example, `M(OD)n --(heat)--> Oxide + D₂O`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Reaction and Identify X:**\n    *   The reaction is `X + Y -> W (gas) + G (precipitate)`. We know B=D₂O, and G releases B, and Y is a liquid. The source of all the deuterium must be from X and/or Y. Since B is D₂O, it makes sense that the liquid Y is also D₂O.\n    *   **Path 1: W = D₂.** The reaction `X + D₂O -> D₂ + G (precipitate)` is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride.\n    *   **Path 2: W = ND₃.** The reaction `X + D₂O -> ND₃ + G (precipitate)` would require X to be a metal nitride (e.g., Mg₃N₂). `Mg₃N₂ + 6D₂O -> 2ND₃ + 3Mg(OD)₂`. G would be Mg(OD)₂, which fits. However, the first clue states that \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". Metal nitrides like Mg₃N₂ don't inherently contain an isotope. This clue points to X itself being the deuterated compound, making Path 1 far more likely.\n\n4.  **Focus on Path 1 (W = D₂):** We are looking for a substance X which is a deuteride, reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O.\n    *   A very common class of reagents in organic chemistry that fit this description are complex metal hydrides, and their deuterated analogs. The prompt specifically mentions that \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n    *   Let's consider Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, LiAlD₄. Its analog, LiAlH₄, is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent in organic synthesis.\n    *   Let's test LiAlD₄ against all clues:\n        *   **X = LiAlD₄**: Contains deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. **✓**\n        *   **Y = D₂O** (heavy water).\n        *   **Reaction**: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`. This is a known, violent reaction.\n        *   **Gas W**: D₂. We confirmed this has equal protons and neutrons. **✓**\n        *   **Precipitate G**: Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. This is a precipitate. **✓**\n        *   **Heating G**: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. It releases D₂O. **✓**\n        *   **Substance B**: D₂O, whose melting point is ~277 K. **✓**\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid**: LiAlD₄ (like LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to hydroxyl groups. The resulting product, a diol, will contain two oxygen atoms. **✓**\n        *   **Organic Chemistry Reagent**: The analog LiAlH₄ is a cornerstone reagent. **✓**\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity of X:** All evidence points conclusively to Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (as Deuterium).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all Aluminium atoms and all Deuterium atoms in one molecule of LiAlD₄.\n    *   We use the mass numbers of the most common/stable isotopes:\n        *   Mass of one Aluminium (²⁷Al) atom ≈ 27 amu.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (²H) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there is **one** Al atom and **four** D atoms.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of Al) + 4 * (Mass of D)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 4 * (2)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:** The calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
