    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the information from the 1H NMR spectrum to determine the number of hydrogen atoms.**\n    The spectrum shows signals for several types of protons (H). By summing up the number of protons represented by each signal type, we can find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** In a di-substituted benzene ring, there are 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, where symmetry causes the 4 protons to fall into two equivalent sets of two (2H + 2H). Total aromatic protons = 4H.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** Vinyl protons are those attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The description of one signal as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). In this group, there are two vinyl protons. Total vinyl protons = 2H.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** This indicates the presence of two distinct methyl groups in the molecule. Each methyl group has 3 protons. Total methyl protons = 2 * 3H = 6H.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This confirms the absence of any methylene groups in the structure.\n\n    Now, let's sum the protons:\n    Total H = (aromatic H) + (vinyl H) + (methyl H)\n    Total H = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 hydrogens.\n\n    This result immediately allows us to eliminate the options with 14 hydrogens.\n    *   B) C11H14O2 is incorrect.\n    *   D) C12H14O2 is incorrect.\n\n    The correct formula must be either A) C12H12O2 or C) C11H12O2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structural fragments to determine the number of carbon atoms.**\n    We can identify the fragments of the molecule from the spectroscopic data and then sum their carbon atoms.\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The carbon framework is C6.\n    *   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group, which has the core structure -COO-. This contributes 1 carbon atom.\n    *   **Vinyl group:** As determined from the NMR splitting patterns (doublet and doublet of quartets), the vinyl protons are part of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3. This fragment contains 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Methyl groups:** The NMR shows two -CH3 signals. One belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The other must be part of the ester functional group. There are two common possibilities: a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3).\n        *   In a methyl ester, the second CH3 is attached to the oxygen. The carbons are already counted in the ester's C=O and the methyl group itself.\n        *   In an acetate group, the second CH3 is attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n\n    Let's assemble the most likely structure and count the total carbons.\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A plausible isomer is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   **Carbon Count:**\n        *   Benzene ring: 6 carbons\n        *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 carbons\n        *   Ester group (-COOCH3): The C=O carbon is 1, and the -OCH3 carbon is 1. Total = 2 carbons.\n        *   This seems double-counted. Let's count from the fragments that make up the whole molecule:\n            1.  C6H4 ring = 6 carbons\n            2.  Propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3 = 3 carbons\n            3.  Methyl part of the ester, -OCH3 = 1 carbon\n            4.  Carbonyl part of the ester, C=O = 1 carbon\n        *   Let's recount based on the pieces: The molecule is composed of a propenyl group (C3), a benzene ring (C6), and a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3) where one C is the carbonyl and one C is the methyl. So, C3 + C6 + C1(carbonyl) + C1(methyl) = 11 carbons.\n\n    Let's try the other possibility: an acetate group.\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with a propenyl group and an acetate group (-OCOCH3). A plausible isomer is 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n    *   **Carbon Count:**\n        *   Benzene ring: 6 carbons\n        *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 carbons\n        *   Acetate group (-OCOCH3): The C=O carbon is 1, and the -CH3 carbon is 1. Total = 2 carbons.\n    *   Total carbons in the molecule = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 carbons.\n\n    Both plausible structures consistent with all the spectral data have 11 carbon atoms.\n\n3.  **Combine the results to identify the final formula.**\n    *   From step 1, the number of hydrogens is 12.\n    *   From step 2, the number of carbons is 11.\n    *   The FTIR data indicates an ester, which contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal check with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) formula: DBE = C + 1 - H/2.\nFor C11H12O2, DBE = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\nThe proposed structure contains a benzene ring (4 DBE), a C=C double bond (1 DBE), and a C=O double bond from the ester (1 DBE). Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The DBE calculation is consistent with the proposed structure and the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
