    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks to identify which of the four given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n2.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are:\n    *   The presence of a chiral center (typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The presence of axial, planar, or helical chirality, where the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Atropisomerism in substituted biphenyls is a form of axial chirality.\n3.  **Analyze Each Compound:**\n\n    *   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. Two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted. The substituents are nitro groups (-NO2) and methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   **Chirality Check:** These substituents (-NO2 and -COOCH3) are very bulky. Their presence at all four ortho positions creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation (atropisomerism) locks the molecule into a non-planar conformation. If you consider the molecule and its mirror image, they are not superimposable because the locked, twisted structure lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** Let's break down the name. \"propanoate\" refers to the ester of propanoic acid (a 3-carbon carboxylic acid). \"methyl\" indicates the ester is -COOCH3. \"2-hydroxy\" means there is an -OH group on carbon-2. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   **Chirality Check:** We look for a chiral center. Let's examine Carbon-2 (the carbon atom bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since Carbon-2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is optically active.\n\n    *   **3. benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** Benzophenone is diphenyl ketone. Its formula is (C6H5)2C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   **Chirality Check:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule (the central carbon is sp2 hybridized, not sp3 with four different groups). The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a C2 axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** Fumarate is the trans-isomer of butenedioate. So, dimethyl fumarate is the trans-isomer of the diester derived from butenedioic acid and methanol. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two CH3OOC groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality Check:** This is a planar molecule (or nearly planar). It possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of symmetry is always achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is superimposable on its mirror image and is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Compound 1 shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is achiral and optically inactive.\n    *   Compound 4 is achiral and optically inactive.\n    *   Therefore, only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    The correct combination is 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
