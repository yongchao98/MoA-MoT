    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the synthesis and the determination of the final structure's properties.\n\n### **Step-by-step Reaction Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. In the presence of acid or base, a ketone can be halogenated at the alpha-position (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   **Mechanism:** Typically, this reaction is performed in an acidic medium (like acetic acid). The ketone enolizes to form cyclohex-1-enol. The electron-rich double bond of the enol then attacks a bromine molecule (Br₂), adding a bromine atom to the alpha-carbon and generating HBr.\n    *   **Product 1:** The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone. Since the starting cyclohexanone is symmetrical, bromination at either alpha-carbon yields the same product.\n\n     \n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heat) → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** This step involves reacting an α-halo ketone with a strong base (sodium hydroxide) and heat. There are two primary possibilities: an elimination reaction or a Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   **Possibility A (Elimination):** The hydroxide ion acts as a base, removing a proton from the other α-carbon (C6) to form an enolate, which then eliminates the bromide ion to form cyclohex-2-enone.\n    *   **Possibility B (Favorskii Rearrangement):** The hydroxide ion abstracts the α-proton from the carbon that is not bonded to bromine (C6). The resulting enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one). The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate. The subsequent ring-opening of the three-membered ring leads to a ring contraction, forming cyclopentanecarboxylate, which is protonated upon acidic workup to yield cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Which path is correct?** The next reaction step involves thionyl chloride (SOCl₂). SOCl₂ is a classic reagent for converting carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. It does not have a common, straightforward reaction with an enone like cyclohex-2-enone. Therefore, the Favorskii rearrangement pathway is the most chemically logical route.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + SOCl₂/Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) reacts with the -OH group of the carboxylic acid, replacing it with a chlorine atom. Pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl gas that is produced as a byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a reduction of an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH₄ which would reduce an acyl chloride all the way to a primary alcohol, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is selective for the partial reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n     \n\n### **Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. We need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule. \"Chemically distinct\" means the atoms are in non-equivalent chemical environments, which would lead to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** A five-membered ring (cyclopentane) is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the C1 carbon it's attached to, the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogens:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (H-C=O):** This proton is unique in its environment. It's on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    2.  **The C1 Proton (on the ring, attached to the CHO group):** This proton (a methine proton) is also unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the C2 position is equivalent to the C5 position. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons (a CH₂ group). These two geminal protons are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because replacing one versus the other would lead to different diastereomers (in relation to the substituent on C1). Therefore, these two protons are chemically distinct. Since C2 and C5 are equivalent, the four protons on these two carbons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n    4.  **The C3 and C4 Protons:** Similarly, the C3 position is equivalent to the C4 position. The two geminal protons on C3 are also diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. Their chemical environment is different from the protons on C2/C5 because they are further from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group. The four protons on C3 and C4 give rise to another two distinct signals. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   1 (from aldehyde H) + 1 (from C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe six types are:\n*   H_aldehyde\n*   H_C1\n*   H_C2(a) (and its symmetric equivalent H_C5(a))\n*   H_C2(b) (and its symmetric equivalent H_C5(b))\n*   H_C3(a) (and its symmetric equivalent H_C4(a))\n*   H_C3(b) (and its symmetric equivalent H_C4(b))\n\nThere are 6 distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
