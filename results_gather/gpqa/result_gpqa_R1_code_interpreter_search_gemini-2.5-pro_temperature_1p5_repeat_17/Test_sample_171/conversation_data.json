    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy state (`N_b`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (`N_a`) is given by:\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   `N_b`, `N_a` are the number densities of atoms in the excited state 'b' and lower state 'a'.\n    *   `g_b`, `g_a` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the states (E_b - E_a).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define \"Excitation\":** The term \"excitation\" in this context refers to the ratio of populations, `N_b / N_a`. Let's call this ratio `X`.\n    So, `X = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`.\n\n4.  **Apply the equation to both stars:**\n    *   For star_1, with temperature T_1, the excitation is `X_1`:\n        `X_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   For star_2, with temperature T_2, the excitation is `X_2`:\n        `X_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n5.  **Use the information given in the problem:** We are told that the excitation in star_1 is twice the excitation in star_2.\n    `X_1 = 2 * X_2`\n\n6.  **Set up the equation:** Substitute the expressions for `X_1` and `X_2` into the relationship from step 5.\n    `(g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n7.  **Simplify the equation:** The statistical weight ratio `(g_b / g_a)` is the same for the iron atoms in both stars, so it cancels out.\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n8.  **Isolate the exponential terms:** Divide both sides by `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`.\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2`\n    Using the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`, we get:\n    `exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2`\n    `exp[ (ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] = 2`\n\n9.  **Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n    `ln( exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] ) = ln(2)`\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n10. **Combine the terms in the parenthesis:**\n    `(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n11. **Substitute the given physical constants:**\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE = 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`.\n    *   Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`.\n    The ratio `ΔE / k` is therefore approximately 1 (with units of Kelvin, although the value is dimensionless in the final equation as `ΔE/k` is a factor of `1/T`).\n    So, `ΔE / k ≈ 1`.\n\n12. **Finalize the equation:** Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into the equation from step 10 gives:\n    `1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n    Which simplifies to:\n    `[ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
