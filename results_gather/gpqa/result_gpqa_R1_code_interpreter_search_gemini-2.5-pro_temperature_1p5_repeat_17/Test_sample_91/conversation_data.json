    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n### 1.  Deconstruct the Molecule and Find its Formula\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the molecule to determine its molecular formula (CₓHᵧ) and the number of each type of chemical bond.\n\nThe chemical name given is `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: This group has 1 central carbon atom plus 2 carbons in the two methyl (CH₃) groups. It has 2 * 3 = 6 hydrogens.\n    *   Carbons: 3\n    *   Hydrogens: 6\n*   `=CH-`: This is one carbon and one hydrogen.\n    *   Carbons: 1\n    *   Hydrogens: 1\n*   `-CH2-`: This is one carbon and two hydrogens.\n    *   Carbons: 1\n    *   Hydrogens: 2\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: This group has 1 carbon in the main chain and 1 carbon in the methyl branch. It has 1 + 3 = 4 hydrogens.\n    *   Carbons: 2\n    *   Hydrogens: 4\n*   `-CH2-`: This is one carbon and two hydrogens.\n    *   Carbons: 1\n    *   Hydrogens: 2\n*   `-CH=C(CH3)2`: This group has 1 carbon in `=CH-`, 1 carbon in `=C<`, and 2 carbons in the two methyl groups. It has 1 + (2 * 3) = 7 hydrogens.\n    *   Carbons: 4\n    *   Hydrogens: 7\n\nLet's sum them up:\n*   **Total Carbons (x):** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogens (y):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 7 = 22\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n\n### 2.  Count the Number of Each Type of Bond\n\nNow, I'll count the C-H, C-C, and C=C bonds.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22. Since each hydrogen is bonded to a single carbon, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The name indicates a \"diene\" (two double bonds). We can see them in the structure: `(CH3)2C=CH` and `CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For a non-cyclic (acyclic) molecule, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms (both single and double) is always one less than the number of carbon atoms. With 12 carbons, there are 12 - 1 = 11 carbon-carbon framework bonds. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the rest must be single bonds.\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = (Total C-C framework bonds) - (Number of C=C bonds) = 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### 3.  Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Molecule\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of a molecule is the energy required to break all of its bonds and turn it into individual gaseous atoms. It's the sum of all the bond energies in the molecule.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n\n**Enthalpy of atomization of C₁₂H₂₂** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n*(This value matches option B, which is a common distractor representing an intermediate calculation.)*\n\n### 4.  Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHբ) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The formation reaction is:\n`12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)`\n\nWe can calculate ΔHբ using the following formula based on Hess's Law:\nΔHբ = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of the product]\n\n**Step 4a: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants.**\nThe reactants are 12 moles of solid carbon, C(s), and 11 moles of hydrogen gas, H₂(g).\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of C(s): 12 * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H₂(g): This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds. 11 * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n**Enthalpy of atomization of reactants** = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 4b: Calculate the final enthalpy of formation.**\nΔHբ = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\nΔHբ = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### 5.  Convert Units and Compare with Options\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Now let's check the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11200 kJ/mol\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nMy answer is in kJ/mol, but option A is in kJ/g, and option C is also in kJ/g. It's likely the question wants the answer in kJ/g. I need to convert my result.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂:**\n    *   M = 12 * (atomic mass of C) + 22 * (atomic mass of H)\n    *   M ≈ 12 * 12.0 g/mol + 22 * 1.0 g/mol = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Convert ΔHբ to kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔHբ (kJ/g) = ΔHբ (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔHբ (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol\n\nNow, I will use a python script to perform this final division precisely.\n\n```python\n# Values calculated from the steps above\ndelta_Hf_mol = 1900  # in kJ/mol\nmolar_mass = 166  # in g/mol\n\n# Convert to kJ/g\ndelta_Hf_g = delta_Hf_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(delta_Hf_g)\n```\n\n11.44578313253012\n\nThe result is approximately 11.45 kJ/g. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the enthalpy of formation of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. We can solve this using the given bond energies and enthalpies of atomization.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count:**\n    First, let's figure out the molecular formula (CₓHᵧ) and the number of each type of bond from the structure.\n    *   Molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n    *   **Counting Carbons (C):** (1 C + 2 C) + (1 C) + (1 C) + (1 C + 1 C) + (1 C) + (1 C) + (1 C + 2 C) = 12 Carbon atoms. So, x = 12.\n    *   **Counting Hydrogens (H):** (2 * 3 H) + (1 H) + (2 H) + (1 H + 3 H) + (2 H) + (1 H) + (2 * 3 H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms. So, y = 22.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n\n    Now, let's count the bonds:\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds `C=C`. So there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of bonds connecting the carbon atoms is C-1. Here, 12 - 1 = 11. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Molecule (Product)**\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous molecule to form individual gaseous atoms.\n    *   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 mol * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n    *   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 mol * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 mol * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   Total Enthalpy of Atomization of C₁₂H₂₂ (ΔH_atom(product)) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n    *(Note: This matches option B, but it is an intermediate value, not the final answer for enthalpy of formation.)*\n\n3.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n    The formation reaction is: `12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)`.\n    We need to calculate the energy required to turn the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas) into gaseous atoms.\n    *   Energy to atomize 12 moles of C(s) = 12 mol * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n    *   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H₂(g) = 11 mol * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n    *   Total Enthalpy of Atomization of reactants (ΔH_atom(reactants)) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHբ)**\n    The enthalpy of formation is the energy difference between atomizing the reactants and atomizing the product.\n    *   ΔHբ = ΔH_atom(reactants) - ΔH_atom(product)\n    *   ΔHբ = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n5.  **Convert Units to Match the Options**\n    The calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. The options include answers in kJ/g. We need to convert our result to kJ/g.\n    *   Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂ = (12 * 12.01 g/mol) + (22 * 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n    *   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
