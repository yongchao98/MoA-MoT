    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The amplitude of this periodic velocity change is denoted as $K$.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity Amplitude:** The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) according to the Doppler effect formula: $\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$. Therefore, the amplitude of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$.\n\n    We can write this relationship as a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1}$\n\n    Given the values:\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n\n    The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Find the Physical Relationship between K and Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) can be expressed by the following formula, which combines Newton's law of gravitation and Kepler's Third Law:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n    The term $m_p \\sin(i)$ is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is what the RV method directly constrains.\n\n4.  **Set up a Ratio for the Two Systems:** We can write the expression for $K$ for each of the two planet-star systems and then take their ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{star2}^{2/3}}}{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{star1}^{2/3}}}$\n\n5.  **Simplify the Ratio using Given Information:**\n    *   The term $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$ is a constant and cancels out.\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$. So, the $M_{star}^{2/3}$ terms cancel.\n    *   The planets are described as having \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, the observable quantity is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin(i)$. It is reasonable to assume that this measured property is what is being referred to as similar. Therefore, we can assume $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$. This term also cancels out.\n\n    After canceling these terms, the equation simplifies significantly:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(P_2)^{-1/3}}{(P_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Period Ratio ($P_2 / P_1$):**\n    We need to rearrange the equation to solve for the ratio of the periods, $P_2/P_1$.\n    First, cube both sides of the equation:\n    $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\n    Then, take the reciprocal to find the desired ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n7.  **Substitute the Numerical Values:**\n    We know that $K_2/K_1 = 7/5$, so $K_1/K_2 = 5/7$.\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Now, we perform the division:\n    $125 \\div 343 \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\nA quick sanity check confirms this. Planet #2 causes a larger stellar wobble ($K_2 > K_1$). For a given mass, a larger wobble implies a stronger gravitational pull, which happens at a shorter orbital distance and therefore a shorter orbital period. Thus, we expect $P_2 < P_1$, meaning the ratio $P_2/P_1$ should be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts is equal to the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes (K).\nK2_over_K1 = 7 / 5\n\n# The relationship between the radial velocity amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P) is K ∝ P^(-1/3),\n# assuming star and planet masses are the same for both systems.\n# K2 / K1 = (P2 / P1)^(-1/3)\n# We want to solve for P2 / P1.\n# (P2 / P1) = (K2 / K1)^(-3)\n\nperiod_ratio_P2_over_P1 = K2_over_K1**(-3)\n\nprint(period_ratio_P2_over_P1)\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",

Identify the question:**\n*   How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? This translates to finding the ratio $P_2 / P_1$.\n\n**3. Formulate the physics:**\n*   The Doppler shift formula relates the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$):\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n*   This means the amplitude of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n*   So, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n*   The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $m_p$ is the planet mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star mass.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n**4.

Simplify the ratio using the given information:**\n*   $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$, so the $M_{star}^{2/3}$ terms cancel.\n*   The problem states the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\". In the context of the RV method, the quantity we measure is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin(i)$. It is a reasonable and standard assumption in such problems that this measured quantity is what is meant by \"similar\". Thus, we assume $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) \\approx m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$. These terms cancel. (If we only assume $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$, the result depends on the unknown inclinations. But typically, these problems assume the $\\sin(i)$ term is also part of the similarity, or that we are looking at an \"average\" case where $\\sin(i)$ is similar for both).\n*   The term $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$ is a constant and also cancels.\n\n*   The simplified equation becomes:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(P_2)^{-1/3}}{(P_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**6.
