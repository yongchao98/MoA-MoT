    "*   **Analysis of the Provided Information:**\n    1.  **Compound:** A chemically synthesized small peptide. Peptides are chiral molecules, being composed of chiral amino acids (usually L-amino acids).\n    2.  **1H NMR Data:**\n        *   Two peaks are observed for a single type of proton (an alpha-proton).\n        *   The two peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   The total integral for the two peaks is 1H, with each peak having roughly half the integral (a 1:1 ratio).\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause. This means the two peaks represent the same proton in two different chemical environments.\n    3.  **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   The analysis is performed at an \"elevated temperature\".\n        *   Two distinct peaks are observed in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n        *   The intensities of the two LC peaks are equal, corresponding to a 1:1 ratio of the two species.\n        *   Both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum (MS), which matches the mass of the expected target molecule.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have at least two chiral centers, with at least one being the same and at least one being different (e.g., an L-L peptide vs. an L-D peptide).\n        *   **NMR Properties:** Diastereoisomers are chemically and physically distinct compounds. They are expected to have different NMR spectra. It is very common for corresponding protons in diastereomers to have slightly different chemical shifts, which would result in two separate peaks, as observed. The 1:1 integral ratio suggests a 1:1 mixture of the two diastereomers. This could easily happen during synthesis if one of the amino acid building blocks was used as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mix of D and L enantiomers) and was coupled to another chiral amino acid.\n        *   **LC-MS Properties:** Because diastereomers have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This would lead to two peaks in the LC trace. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, which explains why both peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This explanation fits all the provided data perfectly.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This implies a side reaction that creates a molecule with a different structure, likely by adding an extra amino acid residue.\n        *   Such a molecule would have a different molecular formula and therefore a different, higher mass than the expected product. The MS data contradicts this, as the observed mass is consistent with the expected molecule. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (e.g., a pure L-L-L peptide and its D-D-D mirror image).\n        *   **NMR Properties:** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They have identical physical and chemical properties and would produce a single set of NMR peaks, not two. Two peaks would only be observed in the presence of a chiral auxiliary (like a chiral solvent or shift reagent).\n        *   **LC Properties:** Similarly, enantiomers cannot be separated on a standard (achiral) LC column; they would elute as a single peak. Separation requires a chiral stationary phase.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since both the standard NMR and LC experiments resolve two species, this cannot be a simple mixture of enantiomers. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate from an earlier step in the synthesis.\n        *   A precursor would have a different chemical structure and a different molecular weight (usually lower) than the final product.\n        *   The MS data shows that both peaks have the same mass, which is that of the target molecule. This rules out contamination with a precursor. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Final Synthesis:** The observation of two species that can be resolved by both NMR and standard LC, yet have the same mass, is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a common outcome in peptide synthesis if a chiral building block is not enantiomerically pure. The 1:1 ratio strongly suggests that one of the amino acids was used as a racemic mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>"
