    "This problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Understand the Principle:**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle connects the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) with its lifetime (Δt or τ). The mathematical relationship is:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth of the state.\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For simplicity in calculations, we can often use ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\nA state with a shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty in its energy. A state with a longer lifetime has a smaller, more precisely defined energy.\n\n**2. Relate to the Problem:**\n\nWe have two quantum states with lifetimes:\n*   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" these two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the inherent blurriness or uncertainty of the levels. A standard criterion is that the energy separation must be at least as large as the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths).\n\nSo, the condition is: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Uncertainties:**\n\nFirst, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s), which is convenient for this problem.\nħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\nNow, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n*   For state 1:\n    ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   For state 2:\n    ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**4. Determine the Minimum Required Energy Separation:**\n\nThe minimum separation needed to resolve the two levels is the sum of their uncertainties:\n\nRequired Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nRequired Separation > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nRequired Separation > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nRequired Separation > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate the options against our calculated requirement:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Clearly resolvable.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two quantum states.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Given lifetimes in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the uncertainty principle (Delta_E = hbar / tau)\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties.\nmin_required_separation = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy separation to resolve the levels: > {min_required_separation:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nfor option, energy_diff in options.items():\n    if energy_diff > min_required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {energy_diff:.1e} eV is a possible energy difference because it is greater than the required minimum of {min_required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {energy_diff:.1e} eV is NOT a possible energy difference because it is less than the required minimum of {min_required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: The core concept needed to solve this problem is the energy-time uncertainty principle. It states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt or τ), there is a fundamental uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is given by:\n    \n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    \n    For practical calculations, we often use the approximation:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n    \n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the energy uncertainty (also called the natural linewidth).\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State**: We need to find the energy spread for both quantum states.\n    \n    *   **State 1**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    \n    *   **State 2**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Determine the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**: To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their combined uncertainty. Think of it like trying to distinguish two blurry dots; they need to be separated by more than the sum of their individual blurriness. A common criterion is:\n    \n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    \n    So, the required energy difference must be:\n    \n    Required Separation > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    Required Separation > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    Required Separation > 7.238 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options**: We need to find which of the given options is greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    \n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV  (which is 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV) < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV  (which is 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV) > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (which is 0.0001 x 10⁻⁷ eV) < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV  (which is 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV) < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nOnly option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation large enough to resolve the two states, given their lifetimes.\n\n<<<B>>>"
