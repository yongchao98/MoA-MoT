    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   **λ1 (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):** This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This is the standard definition of the mean free path in gas kinetics. The formula is given by:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule with another gas molecule. This is essentially the effective area one molecule presents to another for a collision to occur, roughly related to its physical size (πd², where d is the molecular diameter). The √2 factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving.\n\n*   **λ2 (Mean Free Path of Electrons):** This refers to the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule. The formula is given by:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule.\n\n**2. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 lies in comparing their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Collision (σ_gg):** This is a \"hard-sphere\" like collision. For a collision to occur, the two neutral gas molecules must get very close to each other, such that their electron clouds repel. The interaction is short-range. The cross-section is determined by the kinetic diameter of the molecules.\n\n*   **Electron-Gas Scattering (σ_eg):** This is a fundamentally different interaction. The electron is a fast-moving charged particle. The gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a negatively charged electron cloud.\n    *   The electron interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force.\n    *   An electron doesn't need to physically \"hit\" the molecule in a billiard-ball sense. It only needs to pass close enough for its trajectory to be significantly deflected (scattered) by the electric field of the molecule's nucleus and its electron cloud.\n    *   Because the Coulomb force is long-range, the \"effective target area\" that the gas molecule presents to the incoming electron is much larger than its physical size. An electron passing quite far from the molecule can still be scattered.\n\n**3. Conclusion about Cross-Sections and Mean Free Paths**\n\n*   Since the electron-gas interaction is long-range and the gas-gas interaction is short-range, the effective cross-section for electron-gas scattering is significantly larger than the cross-section for gas-gas collision.\n    *   **σ_eg > σ_gg**\n\n*   Now, let's look at the formulas for the mean free path:\n    *   λ is inversely proportional to σ (λ ∝ 1/σ).\n    *   This means that a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path (i.e., collisions are more frequent).\n\n*   Since σ_eg > σ_gg, it follows directly that:\n    *   **λ2 < λ1**\n\nThe electron, being a charged particle, is more likely to interact with a residual gas molecule than another gas molecule is. Therefore, its average travel distance between interactions (λ2) will be shorter than the average travel distance for a gas molecule (λ1). The other options, which introduce specific numerical factors or suggest λ2 is larger, contradict this fundamental physical principle.\n\n<<<C>>>"
