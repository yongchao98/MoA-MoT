    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State (Before Collision)**\n\n*   We have two particles: an electron ($e^−$) and a positron ($e^+$). They have the same rest mass, which we'll denote as $m_e$. The rest energy of each is $m_e c^2$.\n*   The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The relativistic momentum is given by $p = \\sqrt{(E/c)^2 - (mc)^2}$ or, more conveniently, $p = mc\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n**Electron Details:**\n*   It moves from the left, so its velocity is in the positive x-direction.\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n*   Energy of the electron, $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4m_e c^2$.\n*   Momentum of the electron, $p_e = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{15}$.\n*   The momentum is a vector, so $\\vec{p}_e = (m_e c \\sqrt{15}, 0)$.\n\n**Positron Details:**\n*   It moves from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x-direction.\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n*   Energy of the positron, $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n*   Momentum of the positron, $p_p = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{3}$.\n*   The momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_p = (-m_e c \\sqrt{3}, 0)$.\n\n**Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n*   The total initial energy is the sum of the individual energies:\n    $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c^2 + 2m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2$.\n*   The total initial momentum is the vector sum of the individual momenta:\n    $\\vec{P}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = (m_e c \\sqrt{15} - m_e c \\sqrt{3}, 0)$.\n\n**2. Understand the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\n*   The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons.\n*   Photons are massless particles, and their energy is related to their momentum by $E = pc$.\n*   The problem states that the two photons have the same energy. Let's call this energy $E_{\\gamma}$. Consequently, their momentum magnitudes are also equal: $p_{\\gamma} = E_{\\gamma}/c$.\n*   The initial total momentum is only along the x-axis (horizontal). By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be only along the x-axis. This means the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out.\n*   Given that the photons have equal energy (and momentum magnitude), they must be emitted at symmetric angles with respect to the x-axis. Let's say one photon moves at an angle $\\theta$ above the x-axis, and the other moves at an angle $-\\theta$ below the x-axis.\n*   Momentum of photon 1 (upper-right): $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma 1} = (p_{\\gamma} \\cos\\theta, p_{\\gamma} \\sin\\theta)$.\n*   Momentum of photon 2 (lower-right): $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma 2} = (p_{\\gamma} \\cos\\theta, -p_{\\gamma} \\sin\\theta)$.\n\n**Total Final Energy and Momentum:**\n*   Total final energy: $E_{final} = E_{\\gamma} + E_{\\gamma} = 2E_{\\gamma}$.\n*   Total final momentum: $\\vec{P}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\gamma 1} + \\vec{p}_{\\gamma 2} = (2p_{\\gamma} \\cos\\theta, 0) = (2\\frac{E_{\\gamma}}{c} \\cos\\theta, 0)$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $6m_e c^2 = 2E_{\\gamma} \\implies E_{\\gamma} = 3m_e c^2$.\n    This tells us the energy of each individual photon.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** $\\vec{P}_{initial} = \\vec{P}_{final}$\n    We only need to consider the x-component since the y-components are zero.\n    $m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) = 2\\frac{E_{\\gamma}}{c} \\cos\\theta$.\n\n**4. Solve for the Angle**\n\n*   Now substitute the expression for $E_{\\gamma}$ from energy conservation into the momentum conservation equation:\n    $m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) = 2\\frac{(3m_e c^2)}{c} \\cos\\theta$.\n\n*   Simplify the equation:\n    $m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) = 6 m_e c \\cos\\theta$.\n\n*   We can cancel the common term $m_e c$ from both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos\\theta$.\n\n*   Solve for $\\cos\\theta$:\n    $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\n\n*   Now we can calculate the numerical value. We need to find $\\theta$, and then the angle *between* the photons, which is $2\\theta$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From our derivation, we have the formula for cos(theta)\n# where theta is the angle of one photon with the horizontal axis.\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians using the arccosine function\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert the angle from radians to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is 2*theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\nBased on the calculation, the angle between the two photons is approximately 138.19 degrees.

Let's call the energy of each photon $E_{\\gamma}$.\n*   Since the total initial momentum is purely in the horizontal (x-direction), the vertical (y-direction) components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Given their equal energies, they must be emitted at symmetric angles relative to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be $\\theta$.\n*   The total final energy is $E_{final} = E_{\\gamma} + E_{\\gamma} = 2E_{\\gamma}$.\n*   The x-component of each photon's momentum is $p_{\\gamma,x} = (E_{\\gamma}/c)\\cos\\theta$.\n*   The total final momentum is $\\vec{P}_{final} = (2(E_{\\gamma}/c)\\cos\\theta, 0)$.\n\n**3.

    "The calculation is correct. The result `138.18968510422138` degrees is the angle between the two photons.\n\nHere is a summary of the derivation:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy of the electron ($\\gamma=4$) and positron ($\\gamma=2$) is $E_{initial} = 4m_ec^2 + 2m_ec^2 = 6m_ec^2$. This energy is converted into two photons of equal energy, so each photon has energy $E_{\\gamma} = 3m_ec^2$.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total initial momentum along the horizontal axis is $P_{initial,x} = m_ec\\sqrt{4^2-1} - m_ec\\sqrt{2^2-1} = m_ec(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})$. This must be equal to the total final momentum of the two photons, which is $P_{final,x} = 2 \\times p_{\\gamma} \\cos\\theta = 2 \\times \\frac{E_{\\gamma}}{c} \\cos\\theta$.\n3.  **Solving for the angle:** By equating the initial and final momentum and substituting $E_{\\gamma} = 3m_ec^2$, we found:\n    $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The angle between the two photons is $2\\theta$.
