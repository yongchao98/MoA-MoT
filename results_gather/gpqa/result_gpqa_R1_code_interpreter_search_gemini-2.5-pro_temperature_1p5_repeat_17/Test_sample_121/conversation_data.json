    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents points towards a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction selectively brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) of a carboxylic acid. In acetic acid, the α-carbon is the methyl group (CH3).\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction replaces one hydrogen on the α-carbon with a bromine atom.\n    *   CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH\n    *   Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (BrCH2COOH) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) from ethanol.\n    *   BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n    *   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the bromine atom is a good leaving group. The cyanide displaces the bromide.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group (-CN).\n    *   BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n    *   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis used to form a cyclic compound.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It removes the most acidic proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are highly acidic because they are flanked by two strong electron-withdrawing groups (the cyano group -CN and the ester carbonyl group -C=O).\n        *   NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons bearing a bromine atom in 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states *excess* NaH is used. The intermediate formed still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. NaH deprotonates it again.\n        *   NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion on the α-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This cyclization forms a six-membered ring (the α-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentane chain).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Product 4 is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The question explicitly asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, meaning we must count diastereotopic protons as separate signals.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is:\n ![Structure of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/C/cyanocyclohexanecarboxylateEt01.png) \n\nLet's analyze the molecule for symmetry. There is a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4 (the carbon opposite it), the C-CN bond, and the C-COOEt bond. This symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\nWe count the distinct hydrogen signals:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent. This is **Signal 1**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are chemically equivalent (they are enantiotopic). This is **Signal 2**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The ring contains 10 protons in total, located on C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6. C1 has no protons.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to those on C6. However, on any single carbon (like C2), the two geminal protons (one axial, one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are therefore not equivalent. So, there is one signal for the two equivalent axial-type protons (at C2 and C6) and another signal for the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (at C2 and C6). This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, C3 and C5 are equivalent. The two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This results in one signal for the two equivalent axial-type protons (at C3 and C5) and another signal for the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (at C3 and C5). This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** Carbon C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two geminal protons are diastereotopic because they are in different environments (one axial, one equatorial) and are not interchangeable by the symmetry operation. They are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6 signals\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 6 = 8.\n\n<<<B>>>"
