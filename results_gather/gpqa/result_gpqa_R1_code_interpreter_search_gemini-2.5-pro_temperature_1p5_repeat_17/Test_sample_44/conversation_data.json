    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state and the first two excited states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles confined within a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Concepts\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by its principal quantum number *n* and its spin magnetic quantum number *m_s*.\n*   **Quantum Numbers:**\n    *   The principal quantum number *n* can be any positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   The spin magnetic quantum number *m_s* can be either +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n    The problem provides the unit of energy E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n*   **State Occupancy:** Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level *n* can hold at most two particles: one with spin-up (+1/2) and one with spin-down (-1/2), as the states (n, +1/2) and (n, -1/2) are distinct.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Energy States\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. To find the lowest energy states, we must place the four particles into the single-particle energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n#### Ground State (E_ground)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy E_1 = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy E_2 = 2²E = 4E):** We can place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **n = 3 level (Energy E_3 = 3²E = 9E):** This level is empty.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E_1) + (2 × E_2)\nE_ground = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E)\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n#### First Excited State (E_first)\n\nTo obtain the first excited state, we must make the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   **Ground state configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** Promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New configuration:**\n    *   n=1: 2 particles (Energy: 2 × E = 2E)\n    *   n=2: 1 particle (Energy: 1 × 4E = 4E)\n    *   n=3: 1 particle (Energy: 1 × 9E = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_3)\nE_first = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)\nE_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n#### Second Excited State (E_second)\n\nFor the second excited state, we need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state (15E). Let's examine the possible low-energy configurations:\n\n*   **Possibility 1: Promote a particle from n=1 (ground state) to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (1 × E_1) + (2 × E_2) + (1 × E_3) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n*   **Possibility 2: Promote two particles from n=2 (ground state) to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 0 particles in n=2, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 × E_1) + (2 × E_3) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n*   **Possibility 3: Promote one particle from n=2 (ground state) to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_4) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing these energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\nE_second = 18E\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
