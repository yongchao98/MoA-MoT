    "This question requires a two-part calculation for a weak acid-strong base titration.\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid:**\n    First, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) after it's diluted with water. The moles of acetic acid remain constant during dilution.\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.00100 mol.\n    *   The new volume is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n    *   New concentration of CH₃COOH = Moles / New Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by the NaOH. This means 75% of the original acetic acid remains. The solution now contains a significant amount of both a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )\n\n3.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n4.  **Calculate pH:**\n    The ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles. At 25% titration, the ratio of [CH₃COO⁻] to [CH₃COOH] is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n\n**Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry:**\n    At the equivalence point, all the initial moles of CH₃COOH (0.00100 mol) have been completely reacted with NaOH to form 0.00100 mol of the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n\n2.  **Total Volume:**\n    First, we need the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles of acid / Molarity of NaOH = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   The total volume of the solution is the initial diluted acid volume plus the NaOH volume: 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n\n3.  **Concentration of Acetate (CH₃COO⁻):**\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    The acetate ion is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolyze) to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\n5.  **Calculate Kb:**\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n\n6.  **Calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    We use the Kb expression for the hydrolysis reaction: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]. Let 'x' be the concentration of OH⁻ at equilibrium.\n    *   Kb ≈ x² / [CH₃COO⁻]initial\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.020\n    *   x² = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.020 = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n7.  **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is ~4.26, and at the equivalence point, it is 8.52.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Initial State ---\nvol_acid_initial = 0.0200  # L\nconc_acid_initial = 0.05    # M\nmoles_acid = vol_acid_initial * conc_acid_initial\n\n# --- Dilution ---\nvol_diluted_acid = 0.0400 # L (20ml acid + 20ml water)\nconc_diluted_acid = moles_acid / vol_diluted_acid\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles are equal: moles_acid = moles_NaOH\n# Volume of NaOH needed\nconc_NaOH = 0.1 # M\nvol_NaOH_equiv = moles_acid / conc_NaOH\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nvol_total_equiv = vol_diluted_acid + vol_NaOH_equiv\n\n# Concentration of conjugate base [A-] at equivalence point\nconc_A_minus = moles_acid / vol_total_equiv\n\n# Hydrolysis of A-: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# We need Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] = x^2 / ([A-] - x).

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the titration problem.\n\n### **Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles of Acetic Acid (HA):**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M (mol/L)\n    *   Moles of HA = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.00100 mol\n\n2.  **Determine the state at 25% titration:**\n    At 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the strong base (NaOH) to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). 75% of the original acid remains.\n    *   This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base.\n\n3.  **Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n    Where:\n    *   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n    *   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka)\n\n4.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 × 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n5.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles (and therefore concentrations) of the conjugate base to the weak acid is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Define the Equivalence Point:**\n    At the equivalence point, all the initial moles of acetic acid (0.00100 mol) have been completely reacted with NaOH. The solution now contains 0.00100 mol of the conjugate base, sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.00100 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Volume and Concentration of Acetate (A⁻):**\n    *   Initial volume of diluted acid = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Total volume at equivalence point = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    *   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n\n4.  **Consider the Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    The acetate ion (A⁻) is a weak base and will react with water to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n    A⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ HA(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\n5.  **Calculate Kb for Acetate:**\n    The relationship between Ka of an acid and Kb of its conjugate base is Kb = Kw / Ka. At 25 °C, Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴.\n    *   Kb = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n\n6.  **Calculate the [OH⁻] at Equilibrium:**\n    We use the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction: Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.020 M.\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.020 = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n\n7.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.
