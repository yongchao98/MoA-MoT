    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. The structure is symmetric.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                   C=C\n                  /   \\\n                 H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 1a: Reaction with mCPBA.** m-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) is a reagent used for epoxidation. Epoxidation is a **syn-addition**, meaning both new C-O bonds form on the same face of the double bond.\n    *   When a *trans*-alkene undergoes syn-addition, it forms a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomeric epoxides. The mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability, producing two products that are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 1b: Reaction with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The epoxide ring is opened under acidic conditions. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction where water acts as the nucleophile. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen followed by backside attack by water. This results in **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl groups (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water molecule).\n    *   The overall reaction (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n    *   A useful mnemonic for stereochemistry is: **Trans + Anti → Meso**.\n    *   When the racemic mixture of epoxides from the first step undergoes anti-opening, both enantiomers lead to the formation of the same single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound has two chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. The stereochemistry is (4R,5S), which is identical to (4S,5R).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. The structure is symmetric.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                   C=C\n                  /   \\\n                 H     H\n    ```\n*   **Step 2a: Reaction with mCPBA.** Again, this is a **syn-addition** (epoxidation).\n    *   When a *cis*-alkene undergoes syn-addition, it forms a **meso-epoxide**. The starting material is achiral and has a plane of symmetry, and the addition from either the top or bottom face results in the same, single, achiral meso product: cis-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2b: Reaction with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an **anti-addition** via ring-opening, as in Reaction 1. The overall process is an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The mnemonic for this case is: **Cis + Anti → Racemic**.\n    *   When the meso-epoxide is opened by backside attack of water, the two possible points of attack (at C4 or C5) are enantiotopic. Attack at one carbon gives one enantiomer of the diol, and attack at the other carbon gives the other enantiomer.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a **racemic mixture** of the diols.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   Compound 1 is a **diastereomer** of compound 2 and also a diastereomer of compound 3. (Stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on properties like polarity, size, and shape.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like compound 1 vs. compounds 2/3) have different physical properties and will be separated by the column.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (1) and a second, larger peak for the co-eluting enantiomers (2 and 3).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities. This difference allows for their separation. So, compounds 2 and 3 will elute at different times, appearing as **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The **meso compound** (1) is a diastereomer of both enantiomers and will also be separated from them.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers, resulting in **three distinct peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
