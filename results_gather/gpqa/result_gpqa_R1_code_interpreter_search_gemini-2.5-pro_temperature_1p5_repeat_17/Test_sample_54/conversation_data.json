    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from its 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The value is relatively high (downfield), suggesting the proton is attached to a carbon that is bonded to an electron-withdrawing atom, like oxygen.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, which means it has one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a large coupling constant for vinylic protons. The magnitude of the J-coupling constant between two protons on a double bond is indicative of their stereochemistry. A value of ~12-18 Hz is characteristic of a *trans* relationship, while a value of ~6-12 Hz indicates a *cis* relationship. The value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests a *trans* configuration.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"d\" (doublet) indicates coupling to one proton, and the \"q\" (quartet) indicates coupling to three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is the typical region for protons of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (CH₃-C=O), which is characteristic of an acetate group.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is not split, meaning there are no protons on the adjacent atom. This is consistent with an acetate methyl group.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region (protons on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Candidate Structures**\n\nFirst, let's check the total number of protons. The data accounts for 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\n*   **Propenyl Acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl Acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** The structure would be CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃ (or another isomer). The total number of protons is 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10. This does not match the data. Therefore, we can eliminate both Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\nNow we only need to distinguish between Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Assign the Signals to Trans-propenyl acetate**\n\nLet's look at the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:\n```\n      H(b)   H(a)\n       \\    /\n        C == C\n       /      \\\n CH₃(c)        O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)\n```\n\n*   **Protons (d) - Acetate methyl:** These 3 protons are isolated and have no neighbors. They should be a singlet. This matches the signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**.\n*   **Protons (c) - Allylic methyl:** These 3 protons are adjacent to proton (b). They are coupled to this single proton, so they should appear as a doublet. This matches the signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n*   **Proton (b) - Vinylic proton:** This proton is coupled to proton (a) (one proton, so it will be a doublet) and also to the three protons of the methyl group (c) (three protons, so it will be a quartet). The resulting multiplicity is a doublet of quartets. This perfectly matches the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n*   **Proton (a) - Vinylic proton:** This proton is adjacent to the electronegative oxygen atom, which shifts it downfield. It is coupled only to proton (b), so it should appear as a doublet. This matches the signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d)**.\n\n**4. Confirm Stereochemistry**\n\nThe final and most crucial piece of evidence is the coupling constant of the doublet at 7.0 ppm, which is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This large value is characteristic of protons in a *trans* configuration on a double bond. If the compound were Cis-propenyl acetate, the coupling constant would be much smaller (typically 6-12 Hz).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities, and the key coupling constant) are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
