    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound X from the given spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad peak from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent. So, we have a `R-C₆H₄-COOH` structure where the two groups are para to each other.\n    *   Now, let's determine the structure of the alkyl substituent 'R' using the remaining signals:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂). Fragment: **-CH₂-CH₃**.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH). Fragment: **>CH-CH₃**.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂) from the first fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent methyl group and the methine group.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH) from the second fragment. It is attached to the benzene ring and is coupled to both the methyl group and the methylene group. It is also deshielded because it is a benzylic proton.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Let's connect the fragments. The methine carbon (>CH) must be bonded to the benzene ring, the methyl group (-CH₃), and the methylene group (-CH₂). This forms a **sec-butyl group**: `CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)-`.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (C).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction involves treating Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) with **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reagent Function:** This combination of reagents (Red P/HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the alkyl side chain (sec-butyl) are stable under these conditions and will not react.\n\n<search>reduction of aromatic carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI</search>\n<information>\nRed phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reducing agent. This combination can reduce a variety of functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. When an aromatic carboxylic acid is treated with red P and HI, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). For example, benzoic acid would be reduced to toluene. The aromatic ring itself is generally resistant to reduction under these conditions.\n</information>\n\n*   **Product Prediction:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X, not the final product.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Correct. This matches our predicted product structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>",

This confirms the reasoning used to solve the problem.\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify Compound X:** Based on the IR and ¹H NMR data, Compound X was correctly identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n    *   IR: The broad peak at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and the peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicate a carboxylic acid.\n    *   ¹H NMR: The signals at 10.5 ppm (-COOH), the para-substituted aromatic pattern (8.0 and 7.2 ppm), and the signals corresponding to a sec-butyl group (2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9 ppm) all point to this structure.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Reaction Product:** The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, a powerful reducing agent.

    "<information>## Aromatic Carboxylic Acids Reduced to Alkanes with Red Phosphorus and HI\n\nThe reaction of aromatic carboxylic acids with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reduction method that converts the carboxylic acid group directly into a methyl group, yielding an alkane. For instance, benzoic acid is reduced to toluene under these conditions. This method is notable for its ability to achieve complete deoxygenation of the carboxyl group.\n\nThe overall reaction can be represented as:\n\n**Ar-COOH + 6HI → Ar-CH₃ + 3I₂ + 2H₂O**\n\nThis reduction is a vigorous reaction that requires heating. The key components, red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid, each play a crucial role in the process.\n\n### The Role of the Reagents\n\n**Hydroiodic acid (HI)** serves as the primary reducing agent in this reaction. It donates hydrogen atoms to the carboxylic acid, leading to the removal of oxygen atoms. During the reaction, HI is oxidized to iodine (I₂).\n\n**Red phosphorus (P)** is essential for the continuous progress of the reaction. Its main function is to regenerate hydroiodic acid from the iodine produced. Red phosphorus reacts with iodine to form phosphorus triiodide (PI₃), which then reacts with water to produce phosphorous acid (H₃PO₃) and regenerate HI.\n\n**2P + 3I₂ → 2PI₃**\n\n**2PI₃ + 6H₂O → 2H₃PO₃ + 6HI**\n\nThis regeneration allows for the use of a catalytic amount of HI, as it is continuously recycled within the reaction mixture.\n\n### Reaction Mechanism\n\nWhile the exact step-by-step mechanism is not definitively established in all literature, the reduction is understood to proceed through a series of steps. The process involves the initial reduction of the carboxylic acid to an intermediate alcohol, which is then further reduced to the final alkane product.\n\nA plausible mechanistic pathway involves the following stages:\n1.  **Reduction to Aldehyde/Ketone:** The carboxylic acid is first reduced to an aldehyde or ketone intermediate.\n2.  **Reduction to Alcohol:** The carbonyl intermediate is then further reduced to an alcohol.\n3.  **Conversion to Alkyl Iodide:** The alcohol is subsequently converted to an alkyl iodide through a reaction with HI.\n4.  **Final Reduction to Alkane:** The alkyl iodide is finally reduced to the corresponding alkane by another molecule of HI.\n\nThroughout this process, the generated iodine is continuously converted back to HI by the red phosphorus, ensuring the reaction proceeds to completion.\n\n### Comparison with Other Reduction Methods\n\nThe reduction of a carbonyl group in aromatic compounds can also be achieved through other methods like the Clemmensen and Wolff-Kishner reductions. However, these methods are typically used for aldehydes and ketones and are not effective for the direct reduction of carboxylic acids. The red phosphorus and HI method is a more potent reducing system capable of this challenging transformation.</information>"
