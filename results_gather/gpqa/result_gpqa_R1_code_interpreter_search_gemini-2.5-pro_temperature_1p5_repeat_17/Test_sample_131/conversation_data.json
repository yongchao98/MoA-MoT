    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nWe are given the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The key features of the spectrum are:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets (or appear as singlets) is crucial. This means that the protons giving rise to each signal are not coupled to any non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four options based on their molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with two ethyl groups at opposite positions (para).\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. They would produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The -CH2- protons are coupled to the -CH3 protons, and vice-versa. This would produce a **quartet (4H)** and a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and a triplet contradicts the problem statement that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds**. This eliminates option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with. This produces **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. This produces **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with four adjacent methyl groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Although they are adjacent (ortho) to each other, they form an AA' system which appears as **one singlet (2H)** in the spectrum.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent, but they are in a different chemical environment from the C1/C4 pair. This produces **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This produces **two singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. This would produce **four different singlets (3H each)**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining options by combining the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** (1 singlet, 2H) + (2 singlets, 1H each). This would result in three signals (unless there is accidental overlap), which does not match \"two signals\".\n    *   **Alkyl region:** (2 singlets, 6H each) + (4 singlets, 3H each). This would result in up to six signals, not three. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** (1 singlet, 2H) + (2 singlets, 1H each). Again, this would result in three signals, not two.\n    *   **Alkyl region:** (1 singlet, 12H) + (4 singlets, 3H each). This would result in up to five signals, not three. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Assuming their chemical shifts are different, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, their integrals will be equal, resulting in a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets (6H each).\n        *   Assuming these three signals have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 ratio is the only option that produces a 1H NMR spectrum matching all the described features.\n\n<<<C>>>"
