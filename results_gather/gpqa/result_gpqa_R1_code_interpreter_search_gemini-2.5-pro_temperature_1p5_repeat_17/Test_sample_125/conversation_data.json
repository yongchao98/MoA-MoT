    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone. It possesses a single chiral center at the C5 position, with (S) stereochemistry.\n2.  **Reagents:** The reagent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH, LiAlH4), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+). LAH is an achiral reagent.\n3.  **Transformation:** LAH will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at the C3 position.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction of the prochiral carbonyl group in a molecule that is already chiral leads to the formation of diastereomers. The existing chiral center at C5 influences the direction of the hydride attack on the C3 carbonyl.\n    *   Attack from one face of the carbonyl will yield (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Attack from the other face will yield (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed. These two products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reagents:** The reagent is excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is an achiral reagent. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n3.  **Transformation:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Products:** Since the starting material is achiral and the reagent is achiral, the product mixture must be achiral overall (i.e., either meso compounds or a racemic mixture of enantiomers).\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry (if you consider rotation around the C2-C3 and C3-C4 bonds). It is an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) stereoisomer is the same molecule as the (2R, 4S) one, just numbered from the opposite end.\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers [(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol] and one meso compound [(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol].\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Separation on a Normal-Phase HPLC Column**\n\n1.  **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate diastereomers but cannot resolve enantiomers.\n2.  **Analyzing the Mixture:** The combined product mixture contains five compounds in total.\n    *   From Reaction I: Two diastereomers. Since diastereomers have different physical properties, they will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers and a meso compound. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) pair will co-elute, giving a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it has different physical properties and will be separated, giving another peak. This gives a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n3.  **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2). They have different molecular weights, carbon skeletons, and polarities (one alcohol and one ether vs. two alcohols). Therefore, it is certain that the peaks from Reaction I will not co-elute with the peaks from Reaction II.\n4.  **Conclusion for Normal-Phase HPLC:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products: 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Separation on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\n1.  **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all non-identical stereoisomers (both diastereomers and enantiomers), assuming the column is effective.\n2.  **Analyzing the Mixture:** We have a total of 5 unique stereoisomers in our mixture:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n3.  **Total Peaks:** A chiral HPLC column will separate all five of these distinct compounds. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will give two peaks. The three stereoisomers from Reaction II (the two enantiomers and the meso compound) will all be resolved, giving three peaks.\n4.  **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** Assuming no accidental co-elution (which is a standard assumption in such problems), all 5 unique compounds will be resolved. The chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
