    "*   **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is the M+2 peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This 3:1 ratio for the M+ and M+2 peaks is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of <sup>35</sup>Cl and <sup>37</sup>Cl isotopes being roughly 75% and 25%, respectively).\n    *   So, we know the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the <sup>35</sup>Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad peak spanning from 3500 cm<sup>-1</sup> down to 2700 cm<sup>-1</sup> is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm<sup>-1</sup> is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   These two features together strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet (s) because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with and its signal is not split. The integration (1H) confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent. They split each other into doublets.\n\n*   **Putting It All Together and Evaluating the Options:**\n    1.  The compound contains a chlorine atom (from MS).\n    2.  The compound is a carboxylic acid (from IR and NMR).\n    3.  The compound has a *para*-substituted benzene ring (from NMR).\n    4.  Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed structure: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n        *   Formula: C₇H₅ClO₂\n        *   MW = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol (using <sup>35</sup>Cl). This matches the MS data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The structure that fits all the spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Correct. It's a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom and a *para*-substituted ring. Its molecular weight is 156.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This *ortho*-substituted ring would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two doublets.\n    *   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the carboxylic acid proton signal at ~11 ppm and would show an aldehyde proton signal at ~10 ppm. Also, the aromatic region would not be two doublets of 2H each.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It has no O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the acidic proton in the NMR.\n\nThe evidence unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
