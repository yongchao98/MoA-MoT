    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (which is the 3s orbital) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s orbital). This decay occurs via two sequential electric dipole transitions.\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ (the orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ (the magnetic quantum number can change by zero or one).\n    *   $\\Delta n$ is not restricted, but for decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n2.  **Identify the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First Transition:** The atom starts in $|3,0,0\\rangle$, where $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. Since $m=0$, the intermediate state's magnetic quantum number $m'$ can be $m+\\Delta m = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$, so $m'$ can be $-1, 0,$ or $1$. The principal quantum number must decrease, and a two-step cascade to $n=1$ most efficiently proceeds through $n=2$. Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n    *   **Second Transition:** From any of these intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (where $l'=1$), the atom needs to transition to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (where $l_{final}=0$). The change $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ satisfies the selection rule. The change in $m$ also satisfies the rules for all three cases:\n        *   For $|2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$. (Allowed)\n        *   For $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$. (Allowed)\n        *   For $|2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$. (Allowed)\n    All three paths listed in the options A, B, and D are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n3.  **Determine the Transition Probabilities:**\n    The question asks for \"the corresponding probability\". In the context of a cascade, the probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step. Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1 because it's the only decay channel allowed by the dipole selection rules. Therefore, we need to find the branching ratios for the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Symmetry Argument:**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction (z-axis) in space. The three intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy and only differ by their orientation in space. Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state, there is no reason for the atom to prefer decaying into one orientation over the others. Therefore, the transition rates to each of the three $m'$ sub-levels must be equal.\n\n5.  **Calculate Branching Ratios:**\n    Since the transition rates are equal:\n    Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$)\n\n    The total rate of decay to the $l=1$ manifold is the sum of these three equal rates. The probability (or branching ratio) for any single channel is the rate for that channel divided by the total rate.\n    \n    Let the rate for each channel be $R$. The total rate is $R+R+R = 3R$.\n    The probability for any specific route is $P(\\text{route } m') = \\frac{R}{3R} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Formal Calculation (using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients):**\n    This conclusion is formally supported by the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition probability is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling the initial state's angular momentum $(l=0, m=0)$ with the photon's angular momentum $(k=1, q)$ to get the final state's angular momentum $(l'=1, m')$.\n    *   For $m' = 1$ (photon $q=1$): Probability $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,1 | 1,1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n    *   For $m' = 0$ (photon $q=0$): Probability $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,0 | 1,0 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n    *   For $m' = -1$ (photon $q=-1$): Probability $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,-1 | 1,-1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n    The relative probabilities are $1:1:1$, confirming the branching ratio for each path is $1/3$.\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    We can now evaluate the given options based on our finding that each path has a probability of $1/3$.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route and probability are both correct.\n    *   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
