    "The user wants to find the uncertainty, $\\Delta P_z$, of the operator $P_z$ for a system in a given quantum state.\n\n### 1. Understand the concepts\nThe uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the general formula:\n$\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\nwhere:\n-   $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator $A$.\n-   $\\langle A^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A^2 | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator $A^2$.\n-   $|\\psi\\rangle$ is the state vector of the system.\n-   $\\langle\\psi|$ is the bra vector, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Identify the given information\n-   The operator $P_z$ in matrix form:\n    $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n-   The state of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$, as a column vector:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n- The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, which means we can express the state vector in terms of its components along these eigenvectors. The given state is already in this basis.\n\n### 3. Step-by-step calculation\n\n**Step a: Define the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$**\nThe bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all the components are real, it's just the transpose.\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step b: Check for normalization**\nA quantum state must be normalized, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$= (-1/2)^2 + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$.\nThe state is correctly normalized.\n\n**Step c: Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$\nFirst, calculate the action of the operator on the state: $P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n$P_z | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z | \\psi \\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\hbar/4 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n\n**Step d: Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\nFirst, find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_z^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n$P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\hbar^2/4 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n\n**Step e: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n### 4. Verification with Python code\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation can be performed using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define h_bar as a symbolic constant for the purpose of the final answer.\n# For calculation, we can treat it as 1 and add it back later.\nhbar = 1\n\n# The state vector |psi>\npsi = np.array([\n    [-1/2],\n    [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n    [-1/2]\n])\n\n# The P_z operator matrix\nP_z = hbar * np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -1]\n])\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z, <P_z> = <psi|P_z|psi>\n# psi.conj().T gives the bra vector <psi|\nexp_Pz = (psi.conj().T @ P_z @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the P_z^2 operator matrix\nPz_squared = P_z @ P_z\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z^2, <P_z^2> = <psi|P_z^2|psi>\nexp_Pz_squared = (psi.conj().T @ Pz_squared @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the variance of P_z\nvariance_Pz = exp_Pz_squared - (exp_Pz)**2\n\n# The uncertainty is the square root of the variance\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\n# The result is uncertainty_Pz multiplied by the symbolic hbar\n# Since we used hbar=1 in the calculation, the numerical result is the coefficient of hbar.\n# We need to compare uncertainty_Pz with 1/sqrt(2).\n# 1/sqrt(2) is approximately 0.7071\nprint(f\"Numerical value of uncertainty / hbar: {uncertainty_Pz}\")\nprint(f\"Value of 1/sqrt(2): {1/np.sqrt(2)}\")\n```\nThe output of the code will show that the numerical value of the uncertainty (in units of $\\hbar$) is approximately 0.7071, which is $1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFinal result is $\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
