    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The first reaction is the conversion of a ketone (butan-2-one) to a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻ from NaCN) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin. Reagent A must be a proton source.\n        *   `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   `H3O⁺`: This represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H2SO4), which is an excellent source of protons (H⁺). This is the standard reagent used to complete cyanohydrin formation.\n        *   `NaHSO3`: Sodium bisulfite is a different reagent that also adds to ketones, but it forms a bisulfite adduct, not a cyanohydrin. It does not provide the necessary proton for the cyanide reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be a proton source, making `H3O⁺` the correct choice.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This process is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water (H₂O). The reaction involves the addition of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond, eventually forming a carboxylic acid and ammonia (or an ammonium salt under acidic conditions).\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B:**\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. Heating a nitrile with aqueous strong acid is a standard method for hydrolyzing it to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   `CH3COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it could potentially catalyze the reaction, it is far less effective than a strong acid like HCl, and the reaction would be extremely slow or incomplete. Strong acid catalysis is required for efficient conversion.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be a strong acid catalyst, making `HCl` the correct choice.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H3O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these two, the correct option is the one where A is H3O⁺ and B is HCl.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
