    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Expression:**\n    The given expression for the \"size estimate\" is:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\n    Let's break this down into its components from the perspective of a Quantum Field Theory (QFT) calculation:\n    *   `alpha^3 * g^2`: These are coupling constants. `alpha` is the fine-structure constant (`α = e^2 / (4πħc)`), which governs the electromagnetic force. `g` is a generic coupling for another type of interaction. The powers (`^3` and `^2`) indicate how many times these interaction vertices appear in the diagram. This term tells us about the overall order of the perturbative expansion.\n    *   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are numerical factors. Such numbers typically arise from symmetry factors of the diagram, group theory factors (like traces of SU(N) generators), or from evaluating gamma matrix traces (`Tr{...}`). They do not, by themselves, indicate the number of loops.\n    *   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of two energy scales squared. `Q` is likely an external momentum or the renormalization scale, and `M` is the mass of a particle running in the loop. The result of loop integrals often depends logarithmically or as a power law on such ratios. This is a typical feature of a loop calculation result but doesn't directly tell us the number of loops.\n    *   `1/(4pi)^6`: This is the most crucial part for determining the number of loops.\n\n2.  **The Loop Factor Convention in 4D QFT:**\n    The core of the problem lies in recognizing the conventional scaling of loop-calculation results. In a quantum field theory set in **four-dimensional spacetime**, each loop in a Feynman diagram requires an integration over a four-dimensional momentum vector `k`.\n\n    The integral measure for each loop is `∫ d^4k / (2π)^4`.\n\n    When these integrals are evaluated (often using techniques like Wick rotation and dimensional regularization), they consistently produce a characteristic factor. For an `L`-loop diagram, the result is typically proportional to:\n\n    `(1 / (16π^2))^L`\n\n    This factor comes from the `(2π)^4` in the measure combined with the `2π^2` surface area of a 3-sphere that arises from the angular part of the 4D momentum integral. Specifically, `2π^2 / (2π)^4 = 1 / (8π^2)`. However, standard regularization schemes and conventions used in most modern QFT calculations (like the MS-bar scheme) result in the denominator being `16π^2`.\n\n    We can rewrite this canonical loop factor in terms of `4π`:\n    `1 / (16π^2) = 1 / (4^2 * π^2) = 1 / ((4π)^2)`\n\n    Therefore, a calculation for an `L`-loop diagram in 4D spacetime will contain a characteristic factor of:\n    `(1 / (4π)^2)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`\n\n3.  **Solving for the Number of Loops (L):**\n    Now we compare the theoretical scaling factor with the factor found in the colleague's note.\n\n    *   Theoretical factor for `L` loops: `1 / (4π)^(2L)`\n    *   Factor from the note: `1 / (4π)^6`\n\n    By equating the exponents, we can solve for `L`:\n    `2L = 6`\n    `L = 3`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The diagram must have contained 3 loops. This is consistent with the other terms in the expression (a high-order coupling dependence `alpha^3 * g^2` is expected for a multi-loop diagram). Other interpretations, such as the loop factor being `1/(4π)^L` (more typical of 2D QFT) or absorbing the `4π` from the definition of `alpha` into the loop factor, are inconsistent with the problem statement or lead to non-integer loop numbers.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
