    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its properties and calculate its initial IHD.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one carbon-carbon double bond. A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation, and the double bond adds another.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   `2-formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   `5-vinyl` (-CH=CH2): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nLet's calculate the initial IHD (also known as degrees of unsaturation) for the reactant:\n*   1 from the ring structure.\n*   1 from the C=C bond within the ring.\n*   1 from the C=C bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 from the C=O bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 from the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\nTotal IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nTo find the molecular formula, let's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** A systematic count reveals 12 hydrogens (C10H12O3).\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is C10H12O3.\nChecking IHD with the formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Predict the Product**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (hydroiodic acid). This combination is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its effect is to:\n\n*   Reduce all oxygen-containing functional groups (alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) completely to the corresponding alkanes (i.e., replacing C=O and C-O bonds with C-H bonds).\n*   Reduce (saturate) all carbon-carbon double bonds and triple bonds to single bonds.\n\nApplying this to our reactant:\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The `C=C double bond` inside the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe carbon skeleton is preserved. The starting molecule has 10 carbon atoms, and the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. All multiple bonds and oxygen atoms will be removed, resulting in a fully saturated hydrocarbon that retains the original ring structure.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane (the exact name is not necessary, but the structure is a cyclohexane ring with two methyl and one ethyl group).\n\n**3. Determine the Molecular Formula and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon. The general formula for such a compound is **CnH2n**.\nSince our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the product, C10H20.\n\n**Method 1: Using the IHD Formula**\nThe formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon is:\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\n**Method 2: Using the Structure**\nThe IHD is the sum of rings and multiple bonds.\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   Number of double bonds = 0.\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0.\n\nIHD = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained from the reaction is 1. Comparing this with the options provided:\nA) 1\nB) 5\nC) 0\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
