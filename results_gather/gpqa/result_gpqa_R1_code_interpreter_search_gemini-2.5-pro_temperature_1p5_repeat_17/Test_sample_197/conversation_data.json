    "An explanation of the method and the final answer are below.\n[Co(II)]_total = 10^-2 M\n[SCN-] = 0.1 M\n\nThe equilibria for the formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are:\nCo^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+      ; β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+]/([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9\nCo^2+ + 2SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]     ; β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]]/([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40\nCo^2+ + 3SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]-     ; β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-]/([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63\nCo^2+ + 4SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-   ; β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]/([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co^2+], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN-]:\n[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]\n[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2\n[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3\n[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for the total cobalt concentration:\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α2, is given by:\nα2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)\nα2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))\n\nBy canceling [Co^2+], we get:\nα2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n\nNow, we substitute the given values ([SCN-] = 0.1 M, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16) into the equation.\n\nNumerator = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\nDenominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nDenominator = 2.3646\n\nα2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n```python\n# Given values for the stability constants and ligand concentration\nb1 = 9\nb2 = 40\nb3 = 63\nb4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The numerator of the fraction (alpha_2) is the term for the desired complex [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = b2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms from n=0 to n=4, where the term for n=0 is 1.\ndenominator = 1 + (b1 * scn_conc) + (b2 * scn_conc**2) + (b3 * scn_conc**3) + (b4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The fraction of each cobalt species, denoted by αn, can be calculated using the following general formula, where n is the number of ligands (SCN-) attached to the central cobalt ion:\n\nαn = (βn * [L]^n) / (1 + Σ(βi * [L]^i)) for i = 1 to 4\n\nWhere:\n*   [L] is the concentration of the ligand, [SCN-] = 0.1 M.\n*   βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.\n*   β0 is defined as 1 (for the free Co^2+ ion).\n\nWe want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]. This corresponds to n=2.\n\nThe formula for the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂], denoted as α₂, is:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN-]²) / (β₀ + β₁[SCN-]¹ + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴)\n\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n*   β₀ = 1\n\nFirst, let's calculate each term in the denominator (the summation part):\n*   β₀ = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these values to get the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for n=2:\nNumerator = β₂ * [SCN-]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution.\n\n<<<A>>>"
