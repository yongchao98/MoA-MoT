    "An astronomer is investigating a planetary system containing five exoplanets, which are named Planet_1, Planet_2, Planet_3, Planet_4, and Planet_5. These planets are in circular orbits and exhibit orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming that all these planets have the same albedo, the task is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and A is the planet's albedo.\n\nFor planets orbiting the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem also states that the albedo (A) is the same for all planets. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the semi-major axis:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\nThis implies that:\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nBy substituting the relationship for 'a' into the proportionality for $T_{eq}$, we can relate the equilibrium temperature directly to the orbital period:\n$T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nFrom the given orbital period ratios (1:2:2.5:3.5:5), we have:\n$\\frac{P_4}{P_2} = \\frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75$\n\nSubstitute this value back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (1.75)^{-1/3} = \\frac{1}{1.75^{1/3}}$\n\nTo compute the final value:\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\n# The ratio is (P4/P2)^(-1/3)\n# Given P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nratio = (3.5 / 2)**(-1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.8323670691062973\n```\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>",

    "The reasoning and methodology are correct.
