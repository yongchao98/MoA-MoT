As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct conclusion from the experimental data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2:**\n    *   The single knock-out mutant `g2` results in 0% resistance, a complete loss of the wild-type phenotype (100% resistance).\n    *   The double mutants involving `g2` (`g1g2` and `g2g3`) also show 0% resistance.\n    *   This demonstrates that a functional G2 gene is absolutely essential for any level of resistance.\n    *   In genetic terms, when the mutation in one gene (like `g2`) masks the phenotypic effect of mutations in other genes (`g1` and `g3`), this is called **epistasis**. The `g2` phenotype (0% resistance) is expressed in the `g1g2` and `g2g3` double mutants, meaning G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. A gene that is essential for the entire pathway and is epistatic to downstream genes is a prime candidate for an upstream regulator, such as a transcription factor. Therefore, it is highly likely that **G2 is a transcription factor** that activates G1 and G3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the roles of G1 and G3:**\n    *   The `g1` single mutant has 75% resistance, indicating G1 contributes about 25% of the total resistance.\n    *   The `g3` single mutant has 50% resistance, indicating G3 contributes about 50% of the total resistance.\n    *   Since both single mutants have a partial loss of function, neither gene is sufficient on its own for full resistance, but both contribute to it. This rules out a simple linear pathway where one is strictly upstream of the other (e.g., G1 -> G3 -> resistance). A branched pathway where G2 activates both G1 and G3 is the most likely model.\n    *   `G2 --> G1`\n    *   `G2 --> G3`\n\n3.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   The `g1g3` double mutant has 10% resistance.\n    *   Let's check for classical epistasis between G1 and G3.\n        *   Is G3 epistatic to G1? If so, the `g1g3` phenotype should be the same as the `g3` phenotype. `10% != 50%`. So, no.\n        *   Is G1 epistatic to G3? If so, the `g1g3` phenotype should be the same as the `g1` phenotype. `10% != 75%`. So, no.\n    *   The interaction between G1 and G3 is not simple additivity either. An additive effect would predict a resistance of 100% - 25% (from g1 loss) - 50% (from g3 loss) = 25%. The observed resistance is 10%, which indicates a more severe phenotype than expected from simply adding the individual effects. This is known as a synergistic interaction.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the provided options:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: This is strongly supported by the data.\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a plausible mechanistic explanation for how a single transcription factor (G2) could regulate both downstream genes (G1 and G3). It's a reasonable conclusion that fits the model.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: As established, this is technically incorrect by the classical definition. However, in some contexts, the gene with the stronger phenotypic effect (`g3` causes a 50% loss vs `g1`'s 25% loss) is sometimes loosely referred to as epistatic. If we accept this less strict interpretation, this statement could be considered \"correct\" within the context of the question.\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), so we cannot make any conclusions about pleiotropy.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The effect of `g1` is weaker than `g3`, and it does not mask the `g3` phenotype.\n\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. The `g1` mutant has the mildest phenotype, which is not characteristic of a master upstream regulator in this pathway.\n        *   Although the statement `G2 is epistatic towards G1` is correct, the initial premise is wrong, making the entire option incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Incorrect. Gene redundancy implies that the single mutants would have little to no phenotype because one gene can compensate for the other. Here, both single mutants show a significant loss of resistance.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option A provides the most coherent and plausible explanation of the data, despite using the term \"epistatic\" in a non-standard way. The other options contain clear factual errors based on the data (e.g., claiming G1 is the TF, incorrect use of \"redundancy,\" unsupported claim of \"pleiotropy\"). Therefore, Option A is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
