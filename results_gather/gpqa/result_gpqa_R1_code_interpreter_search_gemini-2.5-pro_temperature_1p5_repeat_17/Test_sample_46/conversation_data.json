    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional degree of unsaturation, typically a C=O or C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester (around 1715-1735 cm-1), especially an aromatic ester. It is generally too high for an amide C=O (usually < 1700 cm-1).\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) group and an ester carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a triplet. A triplet means the adjacent carbon has 2 protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3 peaks). This pattern is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-), suggesting an ethyl fragment.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons that are a quartet. A quartet means the adjacent carbon has 3 protons (n+1 rule: 3+1=4 peaks). This is the corresponding methylene group (-CH2-) of the ethyl fragment. Its downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates it's attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom of an ester (-O-CH2-). Combining this with the triplet at 1.20 ppm confirms the presence of an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl: an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the two protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar effects from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at a lower field (8.0 ppm) is due to protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt). The doublet at a higher field (7.0 ppm) is due to protons adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH2).\n\n*   **Putting it all together and Evaluating Options**\n    *   The evidence points to a structure with a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ester group is CH3CH2COO-Ar. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- group around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR (primary amine) and NMR (2H amine signal, no formyl proton).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern. It is also a primary amide, which is inconsistent with the C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the data: the formula (C9H11NO2), the IR bands (primary amine and aromatic ester), and all the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum (ethyl ester, primary amine, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with appropriate shifts).\n\n<<<D>>>"
