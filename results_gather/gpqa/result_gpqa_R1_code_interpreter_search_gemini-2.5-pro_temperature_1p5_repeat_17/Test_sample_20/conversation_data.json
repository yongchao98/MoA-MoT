    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is an equilibrium between two structural isomers called tautomers. A very common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it typically needs a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon). The tautomers must have the same molecular formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** Each -CH₂- group is positioned between two carbonyl groups, making the hydrogens on these carbons (α-hydrogens) particularly acidic and available for tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize to form its enol isomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol).\n        *   Keto form: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃)\n        *   Enol form: Phloroglucinol (C₆H₆O₃)\n    *   **Stability:** The enol form, phloroglucinol, is an aromatic compound, which makes it exceptionally stable. Therefore, the equilibrium strongly favors the enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it can form a stable enol tautomer with the same molecular formula, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite positions (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds. They do have hydrogens, but these carbons are sp²-hybridized. Standard keto-enol tautomerism involves abstraction of a proton from an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n    *   **Tautomerization Check:** If benzoquinone were to tautomerize, it would form 1,4-dihydroxybenzene (hydroquinone). Let's check their molecular formulas:\n        *   Benzoquinone: C₆H₄O₂\n        *   Hydroquinone: C₆H₆O₂\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecular formulas are different. The conversion from benzoquinone to hydroquinone requires the addition of two hydrogen atoms, which is a reduction reaction, not an isomerization (tautomerism). Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A common source of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Chiral molecules are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (carbon-2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl Fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   The molecule has a double bond, so geometric isomerism (cis/trans) is possible, but we are specifically looking at dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer.\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule is symmetric. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the molecule itself), making it achiral. An achiral molecule cannot be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (will show optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
