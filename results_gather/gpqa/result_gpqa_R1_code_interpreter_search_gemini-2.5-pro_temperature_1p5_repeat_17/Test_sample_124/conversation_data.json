    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Identify the Physical System and its Hamiltonian\n\nThe problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential energy is given by:\n$V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$\nIn Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is:\n$V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n\nThis potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of potentials for each coordinate:\n$V(x, y, z) = V(x) + V(y) + V(z)$, where $V_i(i) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 i^2$ for $i=x, y, z$.\n\nBecause the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator equations. The total energy $E$ of the system is the sum of the energies from each dimension:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n\n### 2. Determine the Energy Eigenvalues\n\nFor a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy eigenvalues are given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number.\n\nFor the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies for the three Cartesian dimensions:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The energy levels can then be expressed more compactly as:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### 3. Identify the Third Excited State and Calculate its Energy\n\nThe energy levels are ordered by the value of the principal quantum number $N$.\n*   **Ground State:** $N = 0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $N = 1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $N = 2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $N = 3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have that same energy. For the energy level $E_N$, the degeneracy is the number of distinct combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that their sum is equal to $N$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to get $N=3$ from $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nWe can list the combinations explicitly:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, and the others are 0. The combinations are (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), and (0, 0, 3). This gives **3 states**.\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0. The combinations are the permutations of (2, 1, 0), which are (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), and (0, 1, 2). This gives **6 states**.\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1. The combination is (1, 1, 1). This gives **1 state**.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, one can use the general formula for the degeneracy of the $N$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, which is:\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $N=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nSo, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy of the third excited state.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n\nThe correct choice is B. The energy expressions in C and D are incorrect for a harmonic oscillator; they are related to the energy of a particle in a spherical box.\n\n<<<B>>>"
