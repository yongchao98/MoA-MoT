    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Physical Principles\n\nThe problem involves a harmonic oscillator at relativistic speeds. The key principle to use is the **conservation of energy**. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is not just its kinetic energy but includes its rest energy.\n\n### 2. Define the Total Relativistic Energy of the System\n\nFor a particle of rest mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ in a potential $U(x)$, the total conserved energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n$E_{total} = E_{relativistic} + U(x)$\n\nThe relativistic energy of the particle is given by $E_{relativistic} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\nThe potential energy for a harmonic oscillator (obeying Hooke's Law, $F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nSo, the conserved total energy for the relativistic harmonic oscillator is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n### 3. Apply the Conservation of Energy to Two Key Points in the Oscillation\n\nThe total energy $E_{total}$ remains constant throughout the motion. We can equate the total energy at two specific points:\n*   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n    At this point, the position is $x = A$. The mass momentarily stops before changing direction, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n*   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n    At the equilibrium position, the displacement is $x = 0$. The potential energy is zero, and the mass reaches its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor at this speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n### 4. Set up and Solve the Energy Conservation Equation\n\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at Point 1 is equal to the total energy at Point 2:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} mc^2$\n\nOur goal is to solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n\n1.  Divide the entire equation by $mc^2$ (assuming $m \\neq 0$ and $c \\neq 0$):\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n2.  To isolate $v_{max}$, we rearrange the equation to solve for the square root term. Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n3.  Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n4.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n5.  Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} \\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\nThe derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis matches option (C).\n\n*   **Check non-relativistic limit (for confirmation):** In the classical limit, $c \\to \\infty$. The term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ becomes very small. Let $\\epsilon = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\ll 1$.\n    Using the binomial approximation $(1+\\epsilon)^{-2} \\approx 1-2\\epsilon$:\n    $v_{max} \\approx c \\sqrt{1 - (1 - 2\\epsilon)} = c \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$\n    Substitute $\\epsilon$ back:\n    $v_{max} \\approx c \\sqrt{2 \\left(\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$\n    This is the well-known classical result for a harmonic oscillator ($ \\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 $), confirming the correctness of the relativistic formula. Option (B) is the classical limit. Options (A) and (D) are incorrect based on the derivation and dimensional analysis.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
