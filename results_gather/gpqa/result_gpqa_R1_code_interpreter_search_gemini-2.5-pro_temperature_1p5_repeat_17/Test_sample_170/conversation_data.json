    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), specifically bromination, on a series of substituted benzene rings (C6H5-R). The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of *increasing* yield of the para-substituted product (para-brominated derivative).\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is determined by the regioselectivity of the reaction, which is dictated by the nature of the substituent 'R' already on the benzene ring. The weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar fraction of the isomer, as all isomers from a single starting material have the same molecular weight. Therefore, we need to rank the substances based on the expected percentage of para-substitution.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring are classified into two main categories based on how they influence EAS:\n\n*   **Activating groups:** They increase the rate of reaction compared to benzene and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *ortho* and *para* positions. These are called **ortho, para-directors**.\n*   **Deactivating groups:** They decrease the rate of reaction and direct the incoming electrophile to the *meta* position. These are called **meta-directors**. (Halogens are an exception: they are deactivating but ortho, para-directing).\n\nLet's classify the substituents for each substance:\n\n1.  **ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 (methyl) is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 (ester) is a carbonyl-containing group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl (chloro) is a halogen. It is a **deactivating, ortho, para-director**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 (nitro) is a very strong electron-withdrawing group. It is a **strongly deactivating, meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 (ethyl) is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH (carboxylic acid) is a carbonyl-containing group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n\n**3. Initial Grouping**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two groups:\n\n*   **Low Para Yield Group (meta-directors):** These substances will primarily form the meta-isomer, meaning the yield of the para-isomer will be very low. This group includes:\n    *   4 (C6H5-NO2)\n    *   6 (C6H5-COOH)\n    *   2 (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n\n*   **High Para Yield Group (ortho, para-directors):** These substances will form significant amounts of the para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   1 (C6H5-CH3)\n    *   5 (C6H5-C2H5)\n    *   3 (C6H5-Cl)\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will have the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\nOrder: {4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}\n\n**4. Rank Substances within the Low-Yield Group (meta-directors)**\n\nFor meta-directors, a stronger deactivating effect leads to a higher percentage of the meta-product and consequently a lower percentage of the para-product. We need to rank them by the strength of their deactivating effect.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength for these groups is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   -COOH (carboxyl) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   -COOC2H5 (ester) is also deactivating, but slightly less so than -COOH because the alkyl group (-C2H5) provides a small electron-donating inductive effect to the carbonyl oxygen, making the whole group slightly less electron-withdrawing.\n\nSince stronger deactivation means lower para-yield, the order of *increasing* para-yield is:\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**5. Rank Substances within the High-Yield Group (ortho, para-directors)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer (p/o ratio). A higher p/o ratio means a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The main difference affecting the p/o ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size makes it harder for the bulky bromine electrophile to attack the adjacent *ortho* positions. This steric hindrance favors attack at the less hindered *para* position. Therefore, ethylbenzene will have a higher p/o ratio than toluene.\n    *   % para yield (Ethylbenzene) > % para yield (Toluene)\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing alkyl groups (1, 5) with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom is a unique case. While it is deactivating overall, it directs ortho/para. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is felt most strongly at the nearby ortho positions, making them electronically less favorable for attack than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with some steric hindrance, results in a very high p/o ratio for the bromination of chlorobenzene (typically the para-isomer is ~87% of the o,p mixture). This percentage is generally higher than for toluene (~66%) and ethylbenzene (moderately higher than toluene).\n    *   % para yield (Chlorobenzene) is the highest in this group.\n\n*   Combining these observations, the order of *increasing* para-yield for the high-yield group is:\n    **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**6. Combine the Rankings**\n\nNow, we combine the rankings of the two groups:\n\n*   Low-Yield Group: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   High-Yield Group: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
