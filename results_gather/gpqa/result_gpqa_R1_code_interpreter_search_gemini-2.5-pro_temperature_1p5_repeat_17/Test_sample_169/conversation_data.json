    "An electron is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be represented by a two-component vector (spinor) in the basis of spin-up `|↑>` and spin-down `|↓>` along the z-axis.\n\nThe given unnormalized spin state is `|ψ> = 3i|↑> + 4|↓>`, which can be written as a column vector:\n`|ψ> = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}`\n\nThe operator for the spin component in the y-direction is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n`σ_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}`\nSo, `S_y = \\frac{ħ}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}`\n\nThe expectation value `<S_y>` of the operator `S_y` for a state `|ψ>` is calculated using the formula:\n`<S_y> = \\frac{<ψ|S_y|ψ>}{<ψ|ψ>}`\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the bra vector `<ψ|`**\nThe bra vector `<ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector `|ψ>`.\nIf `|ψ> = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}`, then `<ψ|` is `( (3i)* (4)* ) = ( -3i \\quad 4 )`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the normalization factor `<ψ|ψ>`**\nThis is the inner product of the state with itself.\n`<ψ|ψ> = ( -3i \\quad 4 ) \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`<ψ|ψ> = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`,\n`<ψ|ψ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the term `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`**\nFirst, let's calculate `S_y|ψ>`:\n`S_y|ψ> = \\frac{ħ}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}`\n`S_y|ψ> = \\frac{ħ}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \\end{pmatrix}`\n`S_y|ψ> = \\frac{ħ}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ 3i² \\end{pmatrix}`\n`S_y|ψ> = \\frac{ħ}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}`\n\nNow, we multiply by `<ψ|` from the left:\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = ( -3i \\quad 4 ) \\left( \\frac{ħ}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)`\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = \\frac{ħ}{2} [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]`\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = \\frac{ħ}{2} [12i² - 12]`\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = \\frac{ħ}{2} [-12 - 12]`\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = \\frac{ħ}{2} [-24]`\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = -12ħ`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final expectation value `<S_y>`**\n`<S_y> = \\frac{<ψ|S_y|ψ>}{<ψ|ψ>} = \\frac{-12ħ}{25}`\n\nSo, the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is `-12ħ/25`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
