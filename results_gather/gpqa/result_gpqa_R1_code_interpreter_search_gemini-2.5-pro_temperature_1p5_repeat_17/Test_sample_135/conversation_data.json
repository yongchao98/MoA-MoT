    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   **Vector Field `f`**: The field has a magnitude `|f(r)| = 1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this is expressed as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the radial unit vector.\n\n*   **Volume of Integration `V`**: The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Integral to Evaluate**: We need to compute `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n### 2. Choosing the Method\n\nThis problem can be solved in two main ways:\n1.  By directly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrating it over the volume `V`.\n2.  By using the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) to convert the volume integral into a surface integral.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is generally simpler for this type of problem.\n\n### 3. Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that for a vector field `f`, the integral of its divergence over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n**Important Consideration**: The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field `f` to be continuously differentiable everywhere inside the volume `V`. In our case, the field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂` is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r = 0`). Since the sphere is centered at the origin, this singularity is inside our volume.\n\nHowever, the theorem can still be applied. The value of the volume integral is determined by the flux through the bounding surface. This method correctly accounts for the contribution of the singularity at the origin. This is a cornerstone of Gauss's Law in electromagnetism, which deals with an identical mathematical structure.\n\nLet's proceed with the surface integral:\n\n*   **Surface `S`**: The surface is the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface**: At any point on the surface `S`, the radial distance is `r = R`. So the vector field is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n*   **Differential Surface Element `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface element in spherical coordinates is a vector that points radially outward (in the direction of `r̂`). Its magnitude is `R^2 sinθ dθ dφ`. So,\n    `dS = (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂`\n*   **The Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**: Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sinθ dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sinθ dθ dφ`\n    Notice that the dependence on the radius `R` has canceled out.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Surface Integral**: We now integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sinθ dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sinθ dθ)`\n\n    Evaluate each part:\n    `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    `∫_0^π sinθ dθ = [-cosθ]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n### 4. Alternative Method (Confirmation via Dirac Delta)\n\nFor completeness, let's consider the direct evaluation of the divergence. The divergence of the field `f(r) = r̂/r^2` is known to be zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is a singularity. This singularity can be expressed using the three-dimensional Dirac delta function `δ³(r)`:\n`∇ ⋅ f = ∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`\n\nThe volume integral is then:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\n\nBy the definition of the Dirac delta function, integrating it over a volume that contains the origin (`r=0`) yields the value of the function multiplying it (in this case, the constant `4π`).\n`∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence of the given field is `4π`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 4 π\nD) 0\n\nThe most appropriate answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
