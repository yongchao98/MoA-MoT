    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Molecular Framework:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6).\n    *   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The molecule has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n        *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n        *   **Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** A halogen atom (like F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This means one of the two substituents is simply a halogen atom (-X).\n\n2.  **Deduce the Structure:**\n    *   We have established that the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n        1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n        2.  A substituent containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's figure out the second substituent. A group with 2 carbons and a C=O can be an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Combining these pieces, the molecule must be a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7OX. This structure fits all the initial criteria.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options based on the Deduced Structure:**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring can be *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), or *para* (1,4-). Each substitution pattern gives a characteristic set of signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   The proposed structure is a haloacetophenone. Let's examine the expected NMR signals. The molecule has two types of protons: aromatic protons on the ring and aliphatic protons on the acetyl group's methyl part.\n    *   **Protons on the acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. It has 3 protons and no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Protons on the aromatic ring:** There are 4 protons on the di-substituted ring.\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4-)**, the molecule is symmetric. There are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This symmetry results in a very clean and characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. This is often referred to as an AA'BB' system.\n        *   If the substitution is *ortho* or *meta*, the spectrum would be more complex, typically showing four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This is the classic pattern for a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. It accounts for the 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   **Aliphatic region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet for 3 protons, which perfectly matches an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is fully consistent with the structure of **p-haloacetophenone**. All features match our deduced structure.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (`6.9 (1H, s)`), which contradicts the presence of a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4 aromatic protons). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has **no signals** in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot represent an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n        *   The aromatic signals `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` indicate **para-substitution**.\n        *   The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n        *   This data would correspond to a structure like *p*-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde. The total carbons would be C6 (ring) + C1 (aldehyde) + C1 (methyl) = 8 carbons. This fits the carbon count and the carbonyl group requirement.\n        *   **Crucial Flaw:** In this proposed structure, the halogen is attached to the methyl group (-CH2X), which is an *aliphatic*-halogen bond, not an *aromatic*-halogen bond (Ar-X) as specified by the FTIR data. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nOption A is the only choice that is perfectly consistent with all the provided information: an 8-carbon, di-substituted aromatic ring containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, showing the characteristic 1H NMR signals for a *para*-substituted acetophenone derivative.\n\n<<<A>>>"
