    "An astronomer is studying two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2, and needs to determine the ratio of their total masses.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics\n\nThe problem involves spectroscopic binary stars, where the properties of the stars are inferred from the Doppler shift in their spectral lines. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system that also eclipses, we can determine the sum of the masses of the two stars using the following relationship derived from Kepler's third law:\n\n`M1 + M2 = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * pi * G * sin^3(i))`\n\nWhere:\n-   `M1 + M2` is the total mass of the system.\n-   `P` is the orbital period.\n-   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n-   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n-   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to the line of sight.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both systems exhibit eclipses. This means we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on, so the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass equation significantly.\n\n### 2. Formulating the Ratio\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M_total_1`) to the total mass of system_2 (`M_total_2`).\n\n`M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (2*pi*G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3) / (2*pi*G) ]`\n\nThe constant term `(2 * pi * G)` cancels out, leaving a direct relationship based on the observed quantities:\n\n`M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`\n\n### 3. Applying the Data\n\nNow, let's plug in the values for each system.\n\n**For System 1:**\n-   Period (`P1`) = 2 years\n-   Radial velocity amplitudes (`K1_1`, `K1_2`) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n-   Sum of amplitudes (`K1_1 + K1_2`) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n-   Period (`P2`) = 1 year\n-   Radial velocity amplitudes (`K2_1`, `K2_2`) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n-   Sum of amplitudes (`K2_1 + K2_2`) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nWe will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n```python\n# Parameters for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_1 = 10.0 # km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_1 = 15.0 # km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0 # km/s\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3.\n# Calculate the numerator for the ratio (proportional mass of system 1)\nnumerator = P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)**3\n\n# Calculate the denominator for the ratio (proportional mass of system 2)\ndenominator = P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)**3\n\n# Compute the final ratio\nratio = numerator / denominator\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n[execution results]\n0.432\n[/execution]\nThe calculation confirms the ratio.\n\nRatio = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)\nRatio = (2 * 3375) / (15625)\nRatio = 6750 / 15625\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The analysis of the problem led to the following relationship for the ratio of the total masses of the two binary star systems:\n\nMass Ratio = `(P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`\n\nWhere:\n-   **System 1:** `P1` = 2 years, `K1_1` = 10 km/s, `K1_2` = 5 km/s\n-   **System 2:** `P2` = 1 year, `K2_1` = 15 km/s, `K2_2` = 10 km/s\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n-   Sum of velocities for system 1 = `10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n-   Sum of velocities for system 2 = `15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\nMass Ratio = `(2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)`\nMass Ratio = `(2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)`\nMass Ratio = `6750 / 15625`\nMass Ratio = `0.432`\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4. This means system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2, or in other words, system_2 is more massive.\n\n<<<C>>>"
