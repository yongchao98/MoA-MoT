    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness (often spanning from 2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the hydrogen-bonded O-H group found in a **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it further supports the presence of a **carboxylic acid** (C=O stretch typically at 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of a **C=C double bond** in the molecule's structure.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. This mass-to-charge ratio corresponds perfectly to the mass of a carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Calculation: Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2(16) + 1 = 45 amu.\n        This strongly corroborates the identification of the compound as a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 2. Synthesizing the Information\n\nBased on the combined data, the unknown compound must contain:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. This accounts for two oxygen atoms and one double bond (C=O).\n2.  A **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n`DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for a molecule with only C, H, and O).\n\nFrom our analysis, the molecule must have one C=O bond and one C=C bond. Therefore, its total Degree of Unsaturation must be **2**.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for each given formula and see which one matches our requirements (2 oxygen atoms and a DoU of 2).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O:**\n    *   Oxygens: 1\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n    *   *Conclusion: Incorrect. Does not have enough oxygens or the correct DoU for a carboxylic acid with a C=C bond.*\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   Oxygens: 2\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n    *   *Conclusion: Correct. This formula has the two oxygens required for a carboxylic acid and the DoU of 2 required for a C=O and a C=C bond.* A possible structure is 2-hexenoic acid.\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   Oxygens: 2\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n    *   *Conclusion: Incorrect. While it could be a carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), its DoU of 1 means it cannot also have a C=C bond.*\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:**\n    *   Oxygens: 1\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n    *   *Conclusion: Incorrect. It does not have the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid.*\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
