    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The ring consists of one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms.\n- The name \"pyran-2-one\" indicates a six-membered ring with an oxygen atom (position 1) and a carbonyl group at position 2.\n- \"tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated.\n- \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group is attached to the carbon at position 4.\nThis carbon at position 4 is a chiral center. The two reactions produce the two different enantiomers, (R) and (S).\n\nLet's number the ring for clarity: `O(1)-C(=O)(2)-CH2(3)-CH(Et)(4)-CH2(5)-CH2(6)-`.\nThe chiral center is C4.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a derivative of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n- \"Pentanoic acid\" implies a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end (C1).\n- \"3-ethyl\" places an ethyl group at C3.\n- \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\" at C5 is best interpreted as an isobutyl ester group (-C(=O)O-iBu), as a single carbon cannot have both a ketone and an ether linkage. This implies the molecule is a derivative of a dicarboxylic acid.\nSo, the structure is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n\nStructure: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`\nLet's call this molecule **M**. It has a single chiral center at C3, the carbon bearing the ethyl group. The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of **M**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nWe have two different reducing agents, and they must react differently to account for the stereochemical outcomes starting from potentially different materials.\n\n-   **BH3 (Borane)**: Borane is a highly chemoselective reducing agent. It rapidly reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to primary alcohols (-CH2OH) but reacts very slowly with esters.\n-   **LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride)**: LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4 but weaker than LiAlH4. When a molecule contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester, LiBH4 shows a preference for reducing the ester. This is because the carboxylic acid first reacts as an acid, forming a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻), which is resonance-stabilized and less electrophilic, making it less reactive toward nucleophilic attack by the hydride from LiBH4 compared to the ester carbonyl.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2: Formation of the (S)-lactone**\n\n-   **Reaction**: B + BH3 + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n-   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material B.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` → `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`\n    2.  The resulting hydroxy-ester then undergoes acid-catalyzed (H⁺ workup) intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group (-CH2OH) attacks the ester carbonyl (-COOiBu), displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n-   **Stereochemistry**: The reactions (reduction and cyclization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3). The C3 carbon's substituents maintain their relative spatial arrangement. We must check if the IUPAC priority rules change the R/S designation.\n    -   In the starting material **M**, the substituents on the chiral carbon are: `-CH2COOiBu` (P1), `-CH2COOH` (P2), `-CH2CH3` (P3), and `-H` (P4).\n    -   In this reaction pathway, the `-CH2COOH` (P2) group becomes part of the `-CH2-CH2-O-` lactone chain fragment (P2' in the product). The `-CH2COOiBu` (P1) group becomes the `-CH2-C(=O)-` lactone chain fragment (P1' in the product).\n    -   The priority order of the groups remains the same: P1' > P2'. Thus, there is no change in the R/S designation. An (S) starting material gives an (S) product, and an (R) starting material gives an (R) product.\n-   **Conclusion for Reaction 2**: To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n    **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This narrows our choices to options A) and B). Wait, this narrows it to B and C from the original options.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 1: Formation of the (R)-lactone**\n\n-   **Reaction**: A + LiBH4 + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n-   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group of the starting material A.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` → `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    2.  The resulting hydroxy-acid then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group (-CH2OH) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl (-COOH) to form the lactone, eliminating water.\n-   **Stereochemistry**: Again, the reactions do not occur at the chiral center. However, let's track the substituent priorities.\n    -   In the starting material **M**, priorities are: `-CH2COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH2COOH` (P2).\n    -   In this reaction pathway, the ester group `-CH2COOiBu` (P1) is reduced and becomes part of the `-CH2-CH2-O-` fragment of the lactone (P2' in the product). The carboxylic acid group `-CH2COOH` (P2) becomes the `-CH2-C(=O)-` fragment of the lactone (P1' in the product).\n    -   So, the group that was P1 in the starting material becomes P2' in the product, and the group that was P2 becomes P1'. The spatial positions of these groups are maintained, but their priorities are swapped.\n    -   Swapping the priorities of two substituents at a chiral center inverts the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) designation. Therefore, an (S) starting material will yield an (R) product, and an (R) starting material will yield an (S) product.\n-   **Conclusion for Reaction 1**: To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n    **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n-   Starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n-   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same enantiomer. The different reagents and resulting reaction pathways lead to the formation of different enantiomers of the product.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
