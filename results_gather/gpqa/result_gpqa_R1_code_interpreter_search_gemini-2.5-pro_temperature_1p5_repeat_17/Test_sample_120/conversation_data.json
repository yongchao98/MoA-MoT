    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   This is an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" core indicates a cyclohexane ring (6 carbons) fused with an epoxide (1 oxygen, 2 carbons). The bridgehead carbons where the fusion occurs are C1 and C6. The oxygen is atom 7.\n    *   There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent.\n    *   This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate.\n    *   The problem statement provides the key rules for this reaction:\n        1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n        2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n### 2. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regiochemistry)\n\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by O, C1, and C6.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group and is also part of the bicyclic ring system (connected to C2 and C6). It is a quaternary carbon center.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom and is connected to C1 and C5. It is a tertiary carbon center.\n*   Comparing a quaternary carbon (C1) to a tertiary carbon (C6), **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) will attack C6.\n*   As a result, the C6-O bond will break, and the C1-O bond will become a C1-OH group after protonation (e.g., during aqueous workup).\n\n### 3. Determine the Structure of the Product Skeleton\n\n*   The reactant has a cyclohexane ring with methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   The reaction adds a new methyl group at C6.\n*   The epoxide oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To get the IUPAC name, we number the ring starting from the carbon bearing the -OH group, which is the original C1. So, this is C1 of the product.\n*   The original C1 also had a methyl group, so there's a methyl group at C1 of the product.\n*   The new methyl group is at the original C6 position. This is adjacent to the new C1, so it becomes C2 (if we number towards it).\n*   The other methyl groups are at the original C3 and C4 positions.\n*   Let's find the lowest locant set for the methyl groups. Let's call the original carbons C1', C2', etc.\n    *   Product has substituents at C1' (OH, Me), C3' (Me), C4' (Me), C6' (Me).\n    *   New IUPAC numbering: C1 = C1'.\n    *   We can number C1 → C2' or C1 → C6'.\n        *   Numbering C1 → C6' gives Me groups at C1, C2(old C6'), C4(old C4'), C5(old C3'). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   Numbering C1 → C2' gives Me groups at C1, C3(old C3'), C4(old C4'), C6(old C6'). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   Comparing {1,2,4,5} and {1,3,4,6}, the first set {1,2,4,5} is lower.\n*   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a \"2,2,4,5\" substitution pattern.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\n\nThis requires us to know the 3D structure of the reactant and trace the changes. We can represent the cyclohexane ring using a planar hexagon with wedges (up) and dashes (down) to denote stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Step 4a: Determine Reactant Stereochemistry**\n    *   The cis-fusion of the epoxide is most stable, so let's assume the epoxide oxygen is \"up\" (on a wedge).\n    *   We need to place the substituents to match the (1R,3R,4R,6S) configuration.\n        *   **C6 (S):** Groups are O > C1 > C5 > H. With O on a wedge, H must be on a dash (down, α) for the configuration to be S. (Viewing from H, the path O→C1→C5 is counter-clockwise).\n        *   **C1 (R):** Groups are O > C6 > C2 > Me. With O on a wedge, Me must be on a dash (down, α) for the configuration to be R. (Viewing from Me, the path O→C6→C2 is clockwise).\n        *   **C3 (R):** Groups are C4 > C2 > Me > H. H must be on a dash (α) and Me on a wedge (up, β) to get R configuration.\n        *   **C4 (R):** Groups are C5 > C3 > Me > H. H must be on a dash (α) and Me on a wedge (up, β) to get R configuration.\n    *   Summary of reactant stereochemistry: O(wedge), C1-Me(dash), C6-H(dash), C3-Me(wedge), C4-Me(wedge).\n\n*   **Step 4b: Trace Stereochemical Changes**\n    *   **Attack:** The C6-O bond is on a wedge (up). The Sₙ2 attack by Me⁻ must occur from the opposite face, i.e., from the dash side (down).\n    *   **Inversion at C6:** The incoming Me group will be on a dash. The original H at C6, which was on a dash, is inverted to a wedge position.\n    *   **Retention at C1:** The configuration at C1 is retained. The C1-O bond (wedge) becomes a C1-OH bond (wedge). The C1-Me group remains on a dash.\n    *   **No change at C3 and C4:** The Me groups at C3 and C4 remain on wedges.\n\n*   **Step 4c: Assign R/S Configuration to the Product**\n    *   Product IUPAC numbering: C1(old C1), C2(old C6), C3(old C5), C4(old C4), C5(old C3), C6(old C2).\n    *   Product Stereochemistry (Wedge/Dash):\n        *   **C1:** OH(wedge), Me(dash).\n        *   **C2(old C6):** Me(dash), H(wedge).\n        *   **C4(old C4):** Me(wedge), H(dash).\n        *   **C5(old C3):** Me(wedge), H(dash).\n    *   Now, let's assign the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities and determine the configuration for each chiral center in the product.\n        *   **C1:** Priorities: OH > C2(-CH(Me)-) > C6(-CH₂-) > Me. With Me on a dash (pointing away), we view the remaining groups. OH(up), C2(right), C6(left). The path OH→C2→C6 is clockwise. Thus, **C1 is R**.\n        *   **C2:** Priorities: C1(-C(OH)(Me)-) > C3(-CH₂-) > Me > H. The H is on a wedge (pointing toward us). We determine the configuration for the other groups and then reverse it. The path C1→C3→Me is counter-clockwise. Since H is on a wedge, we reverse the assignment from S to R. Thus, **C2 is R**.\n        *   **C4:** This is the original C4. Its configuration was R and is unchanged. Thus, **C4 is R**.\n        *   **C5:** This is the original C3. Its configuration was R and is unchanged. Thus, **C5 is R**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product has the configuration (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n### 5. Final Answer Selection\n\nThe product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
