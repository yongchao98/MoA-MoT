    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 ($L_1 / L_2$).\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Laws**\n*   **Luminosity of a Star (Stefan-Boltzmann Law):** The luminosity (total energy radiated per unit time) of a star, assuming it behaves as a perfect black body, is given by the formula:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $L$ is the luminosity.\n    *   $R$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $T$ is the star's effective surface temperature.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Peak Wavelength of Black Body Radiation (Wien's Displacement Law):** This law relates the star's surface temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most light ($\\lambda_{max}$).\n    $\\lambda_{max, em} = b / T$\n    where:\n    *   $\\lambda_{max, em}$ is the *emitted* peak wavelength (in the star's own rest frame).\n    *   $b$ is Wien's displacement constant.\n    This implies that the temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{max, em}$).\n\n*   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** Since Star_2 is moving at a significant speed relative to the observer, the observed wavelength of its light will be shifted. The formula relating the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$\n    where:\n    *   $v$ is the radial velocity (positive for receding, negative for approaching).\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Set up the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars, the ratio of their luminosities is:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**4. Use the Given Information**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    Substituting this into the equation:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n*   **Peak Wavelength:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n\n**5. Relate Temperatures using Doppler Shift and Wien's Law**\nWe need to find the ratio of the true temperatures ($T_1/T_2$), which depends on the *emitted* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max, em}$).\n\n*   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$. Therefore, there is no Doppler shift.\n    $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, em, 1}$\n\n*   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. By standard astronomical convention, a positive radial velocity indicates that the object is receding. The observed light is redshifted.\n    $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, em, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n\n*   **Connecting the wavelengths:** Since $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$, we have:\n    $\\lambda_{max, em, 1} = \\lambda_{max, em, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n\n*   **Finding the temperature ratio:** From Wien's Law, $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{max, em, 2} / \\lambda_{max, em, 1}$. Rearranging the equation above gives:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{max, em, 2}}{\\lambda_{max, em, 1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n    Therefore:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}} \\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c} \\right)^2 $\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the result using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given information ---\n# Radius ratio\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nv2 = 700.0\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 299792.458\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio to the fourth power\n# (T1/T2)^4 = ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))^2\ntemp_ratio_to_fourth = ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2**2) * temp_ratio_to_fourth\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n2.229158359216962\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229. Looking at the options provided:\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe value 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\nThe information about the mass ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is extra information and not required for the calculation, as the problem specifies to assume the stars radiate as black bodies and provides sufficient information about their radii and temperatures (via peak wavelength and velocity).\n\n<<<A>>>",
