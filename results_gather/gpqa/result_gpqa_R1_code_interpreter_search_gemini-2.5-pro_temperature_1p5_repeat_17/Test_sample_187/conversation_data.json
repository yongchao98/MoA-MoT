    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Given Parameters:**\n    The problem specifies a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are:\n    *   Lattice parameter (interatomic distance), `a = 10` Angstrom. In a rhombohedral system, the primitive lattice vectors have equal length, `a = b = c`.\n    *   Interfacial angle, `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n    *   The Miller indices of the plane are `(hkl) = (111)`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Interplanar Distance:**\n    For a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` is given by:\n    `1/d_hkl^2 = [(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)sin^2(α) + 2(hk + kl + hl)(cos^2(α) - cos(α))] / [a^2 * (1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane (Optional but Recommended):**\n    For the specific case of the (111) plane, where `h=k=l=1`, the formula can be significantly simplified.\n    *   `h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + hl = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`\n\n    Substituting these into the general formula:\n    `1/d_111^2 = [3sin^2(α) + 6(cos^2(α) - cos(α))] / [a^2 * (1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))]`\n\n    By using trigonometric identities (`sin^2(α) = 1 - cos^2(α)`) and polynomial factorization, the numerator simplifies to `3(1-cos(α))^2` and the denominator simplifies to `a^2 * (1-cos(α))^2 * (1+2cos(α))`.\n\n    The `(1-cos(α))^2` terms cancel out, leading to a much simpler formula:\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3 / [a^2 * (1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\n    Rearranging for `d_111`:\n    `d_111^2 = [a^2 * (1 + 2cos(α))] / 3`\n    `d_111 = a * sqrt[(1 + 2cos(α)) / 3]`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values and Calculate:**\n    Now, substitute the given values into the simplified formula:\n    *   `a = 10`\n    *   `α = 30°`, so `cos(α) = cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2`\n\n    `d_111 = 10 * sqrt[(1 + 2 * (sqrt(3)/2)) / 3]`\n    `d_111 = 10 * sqrt[(1 + sqrt(3)) / 3]`\n\n5.  **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    To get the final numerical answer, we'll perform the calculation using a python script for accuracy. The script will use the general formula to ensure correctness without relying on the simplification.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1\n\n# Convert angle to radians\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate trigonometric values\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\nsin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)\ncos2_alpha = cos_alpha**2\ncos3_alpha = cos_alpha**3\n\n# Numerator of the general formula for 1/d^2\nnumerator = (h**2 + k**2 + l**2) * sin_alpha**2 + 2 * (h*k + k*l + h*l) * (cos2_alpha - cos_alpha)\n\n# Denominator of the general formula for 1/d^2\ndenominator = a**2 * (1 - 3*cos2_alpha + 2*cos3_alpha)\n\n# Calculate 1/d^2\n# This handles potential floating point issues if denominator is close to zero\nif abs(denominator) < 1e-9:\n    # This case happens for specific angles like 90 degrees, not here.\n    # Handle error or special case\n    d_111 = float('inf') \nelse:\n    inv_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n    if inv_d_squared > 0:\n        d_111 = 1 / math.sqrt(inv_d_squared)\n    else:\n        # Should not happen for valid crystal parameters\n        d_111 = float('nan')\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\n\n<execute_code>\n9.542939504381387\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value `d_111 ≈ 9.54` Angstrom matches option B.\n    A) 8.95 Angstrom\n    B) 9.54 Angstrom\n    C) 10.05 Angstrom\n    D) 9.08 Angstrom\n\n<<<B>>>",
