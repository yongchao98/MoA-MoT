    "This problem deals with the physics of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential probability distribution. A key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless\".\n\n**1. Understand the Model of Radioactive Decay**\n\nThe probability `P(t)` that an atom decays within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n`P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\nwhere:\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n*   `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, which is specific to the atom.\n\nCorrespondingly, the probability `S(t)` that the atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` is:\n`S(t) = 1 - P(t) = e^(-λt)`\n\n**2. Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P(100) = 0.32`\n\nThis means the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes is:\n`S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nUsing the survival formula, we have:\n`S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\nThis equation defines the decay characteristic (`λ`) of our atom. We don't need to find `λ` explicitly.\n\n**3. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nRadioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of decay in a future interval is independent of how long the atom has already existed. The atom does not \"age\".\n\nThe question asks for the probability of decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is equivalent to asking for the probability that a *new* atom of the same type will decay within a 150-minute period.\n\nSo, we need to calculate `P(150)`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Desired Probability**\n\nWe need to find `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n\nWe can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` from the information we found in step 2:\n`e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\nLet's manipulate the expression we need:\n`e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value `0.68`:\n`e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nFinally, calculate the probability of decay:\n`P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nWe can use a calculator or a simple script to compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 0.68.\n# S(100) = 0.68\n# The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property, this is P(150) = 1 - S(150).\n# S(t) = S(100)^(t/100)\n# So, S(150) = S(100)^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5\n# P(150) = 1 - 0.68**1.5\n\nprobability = 1 - 0.68**1.5\nprint(f\"{probability:.4f}\")\n```\n\nThe calculation gives:\n`1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\nThis probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Understanding the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process governed by exponential probability laws. The key properties are:\n*   The probability of an atom decaying is constant over time.\n*   The process is **memoryless**. This is the most critical concept for this problem. It means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"get old\" or \"become more likely to decay\".\n\n**2. Defining the Mathematical Model**\n\n*   Let `P(t)` be the probability that an atom decays within a time interval of length `t`.\n*   Let `S(t)` be the probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time interval of length `t`.\n*   These are related by `P(t) = 1 - S(t)`.\n*   The survival probability follows an exponential decay law: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant unique to the type of atom.\n\n**3. Using the Given Information**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n*   `P(100) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n*   `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nUsing the formula `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, we have:\n*   `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\nThis equation defines the specific decay characteristic of our atom.\n\n**4. Applying the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, the 50 minutes that have already passed do not influence the future. The problem is therefore equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute period?\"\n\nSo, we need to calculate `P(150)`.\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to find `P(150) = 1 - S(150)`. First, let's find `S(150)`.\nWe know `S(t) = e^(-λt)`. Therefore, `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150)`.\n\nWe can relate this to the value we know, `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n*   `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n*   Now, substitute the value for `S(100)`:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nFinally, we can calculate the decay probability `P(150)`:\n*   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nThe python script calculated this value: `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.4393`.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 40%\nB) 52%\nC) 44%\nD) 48%\n\nThe closest answer is 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
