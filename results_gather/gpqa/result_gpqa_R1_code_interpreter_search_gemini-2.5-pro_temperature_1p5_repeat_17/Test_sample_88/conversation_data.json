    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1.**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents:** We start with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, tricyclic alkane derivative. The reagents are excess potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base, and high temperature (240°C). These are harsh conditions that can induce complex rearrangements or fragmentations, not just simple substitution or elimination.\n2.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **Formula:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows a total of 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 protons. The starting adamantane core (C10H16) loses 2 protons when brominated, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane is C10H14Br2. The reaction with KOH results in a product with the formula C10H14O.\n    *   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DU):** For a formula of C10H14O, the DU is calculated as DU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 10 - (14/2) + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 7 + 1 = 4.\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** A strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone. A standard adamantane skeleton has 3 rings (DU=3). A carbonyl group adds one more degree of unsaturation. Total DU = 3 (rings) + 1 (C=O) = 4. This matches the formula.\n3.  **Resolve the Contradiction:** The subsequent reaction is an ozonolysis, which cleaves a C=C double bond. This implies that Product 2, and therefore Product 1, must contain a C=C bond. However, a structure with a C10 adamantane skeleton, a C=O, and a C=C bond would have DU = 3 (rings) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 5. This contradicts the formula C10H14O which has DU=4.\n4.  **Deduce the Correct Structure of Product 1:** The contradiction is resolved if the adamantane cage has rearranged into a bicyclic (2-ring) system. A structure with 2 rings, 1 C=O, and 1 C=C would have DU = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, which perfectly matches the formula C10H14O.\n    *   Let's re-examine the NMR data: The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly diagnostic. This chemical shift is typical for protons of an exocyclic methylene group (a C=CH2 group).\n    *   We need to find a C10H14O structure that is a bicyclic ketone and has a C=CH2 group. The most plausible structure that can be formed from an adamantane rearrangement is **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n    *   Let's verify this structure:\n        *   **Framework:** It is a C10 bicyclic system. The base skeleton is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (C9) with a ketone. A methylene group (=CH2) is added at position 7, making it C10.\n        *   **Formula:** The number of hydrogens is 14. The formula is C10H14O. This matches the NMR integration.\n        *   **DU:** 2 rings + 1 C=O + 1 C=C = 4. This matches the formula.\n        *   **Spectroscopy:** The C=O is in a six-membered ring, consistent with the 1720 cm⁻¹ IR peak. The two protons of the =CH2 group would appear around 4.8 ppm, consistent with the 4.79 ppm (2H) signal.\n\nTherefore, **Product 1 is 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one.**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)3. This is the standard reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** The MPV reduction selectively reduces the ketone (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (CH-OH) and does not affect the C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol. So, **Product 2 is 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol.**\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O3) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup.\n*   **Transformation:** Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic C=CH2 group at C7 is cleaved to form a ketone (C=O) at C7 and formaldehyde (H2C=O). The DMS is a reducing agent for the ozonide intermediate and is itself oxidized to DMSO.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The skeleton remains bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. It retains the alcohol at C3 (from the previous step, whoops, alcohol is at C3, C=CH2 at C7) alcohol is at C3. The C=CH2 at C7 is converted to C=O.\n    *   Correction: The MPV reduction in step 2 reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol at C3. So Product 2 is 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol.\n    *   The ozonolysis in step 3 cleaves the double bond at C7, turning it into a ketone. So the final product has an alcohol at C3 and a ketone at C7.\n    *   **Product 3 is 3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one.** (Note: 3-hydroxy-..., -7-one is equivalent to 7-hydroxy-..., -3-one by renumbering the symmetric skeleton).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is 3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** We need to identify the most deshielded proton (excluding the exchangeable O-H proton). In this structure, we have:\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8): ~2.2-2.6 ppm.\n    *   The carbinol proton (the H attached to the carbon with the OH group, at C3): ~3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Other aliphatic and bridgehead protons: < 3 ppm.\n    The carbinol proton at C3 (H3) is clearly the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H3:** To determine the multiplicity (coupling pattern) of H3, we must look at its neighboring protons. The carbon C3 is bonded to C2 and C4. So, H3 is coupled to the protons on C2 and C4. Each of these is a CH2 group. Therefore, H3 is coupled to a total of four protons.\n*   **Symmetry and Coupling Constants:** The molecule 3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one has a C2 axis of symmetry that passes through C9 and the midpoint of the C3-C7 bond. Wait, this is not correct for the hydroxy-ketone, this was true for the dione. For 3-hydroxy-7-ketone the C2 symmetry is lost. However, in these bicyclic systems, especially in textbook problems, we often assume an idealized geometry where the local environments are very similar.\n    *   Let's assume the bicyclic system is in a rigid chair-chair conformation. The carbinol proton H3 can be axial or equatorial. Let's assume it is axial.\n    *   H3 couples to the axial and equatorial protons on C2 and C4 (H2ax, H2eq, H4ax, H4eq).\n    *   Due to the similar geometry of the two paths (C3-C2 and C3-C4), we can assume approximate equivalence: J(H3, H2ax) ≈ J(H3, H4ax) = J_large (axial-axial coupling, ~10-13 Hz).\n    *   And J(H3, H2eq) ≈ J(H3, H4eq) = J_small (axial-equatorial coupling, ~2-5 Hz).\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** H3 is coupled to two equivalent protons with a large J, and two other equivalent protons with a small J. This coupling gives rise to a **triplet of triplets (tt)**. The large coupling to the two axial neighbors splits the signal into a triplet. Each line of this triplet is then split again into a smaller triplet by the two equatorial neighbors.\n\nFinal Answer options check:\nA) pentet: Incorrect. Requires coupling to four equivalent protons.\nB) triplet of triplets: Correct. Matches our analysis of coupling to two pairs of equivalent protons with different coupling constants.\nC) doublet of triplets: Incorrect. Requires coupling to one proton and a pair of protons.\nD) triplet: Incorrect. Requires coupling to only two protons.\n\n<<<B>>>"
