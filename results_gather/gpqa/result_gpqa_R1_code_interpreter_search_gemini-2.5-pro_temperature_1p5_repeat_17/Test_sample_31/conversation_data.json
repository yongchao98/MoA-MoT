    "E = mc^2\n\n*   m0 = 6.0151228 amu is the rest mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n*   v = 0.96c is the velocity of the nucleus.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   amu = 931.5 MeV/c^2 is the atomic mass unit in terms of energy.\n\nThe total energy E of a relativistic particle is given by the formula:\nE = γ * m0 * c^2\nwhere γ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor γ for v = 0.96c:\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.0784)\nγ = 1 / 0.28\nγ ≈ 3.571428\n\nNext, let's calculate the rest energy (E0) of the Lithium-6 nucleus in GeV:\nE0 = m0 * c^2\nE0 = 6.0151228 amu * (931.5 MeV/c^2) * c^2\nE0 = 6.0151228 * 931.5 MeV\nE0 ≈ 5603.0818 MeV\nTo convert this to GeV, we divide by 1000:\nE0 ≈ 5.60308 GeV\n\nFinally, we calculate the total energy E:\nE = γ * E0\nE ≈ 3.571428 * 5.60308 GeV\nE ≈ 20.011 GeV\n\nThe calculation using a more precise value for the Lorentz factor gives:\nE ≈ (1/0.28) * 5.6030818 GeV ≈ 20.01099 GeV.\n\nThe closest answer is 20.132 GeV. Let's re-evaluate using slightly different standard values for constants, or check the provided options.\n\nLet's assume the question uses a slightly different mass or set of constants, for example, the atomic mass instead of the nuclear mass.\nAtomic mass of ⁶Li is 6.0151228 u.\nRest energy E₀ = 6.0151228 u * 931.494 MeV/u ≈ 5602.8 MeV ≈ 5.6028 GeV.\nTotal Energy E = γ * E₀ ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6028 GeV ≈ 20.0099 GeV.\n\nThere might be a slight discrepancy due to the exact values of constants used in the problem's source material, or the intended mass might have been for a different isotope or simply a rounded nucleon mass approximation.\n\nLet's work backward from option C:\nIf E = 20.132 GeV, then E₀ = E / γ = 20.132 GeV / 3.5714... = 5.637 GeV.\nThis would correspond to a rest mass of 5.637 GeV / (0.9315 GeV/u) ≈ 6.052 u. This is not the correct mass for ⁶Li.\n\nLet's reconsider the calculation. It is robust. The calculated value is ~20.011 GeV.\nE = 20.011 GeV.\nGiven the options:\nA) 21.419\nB) 18.475 GeV\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.011 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV. The small difference (about 0.6%) could be due to the specific values of physical constants used to create the question. Without further information, C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
