    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Relativistic Velocity Addition/Subtraction:** When dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't simply add or subtract velocities. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, their relative velocity $v_{rel}$ is given by:\n    $v_{rel} = (v_1 - v_2) / (1 - (v_1 * v_2) / c^2)$\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy ($E$) of a moving particle is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. It's given by the formula:\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2$\n    where:\n    *   $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $m$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe total energy of a system of particles is the sum of the individual total energies of each particle.\n\n**2. Define the Given Variables**\n\n*   Mass of the first astronaut ($m_1$): $2m$\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut ($v_1$): $0.6c$\n*   Mass of the second astronaut ($m_2$): $3m$\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut ($v_2$): $0.5c$\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nWe use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula:\n$v_{rel} = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)$\n$v_{rel} = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)$\n$v_{rel} = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)$\n$v_{rel} = 0.1c / 0.7$\n$v_{rel} = (1/7)c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$. We need to calculate the energy of each astronaut separately.\n\n*   **Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n    First, find its Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n    $\\gamma_1 = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v_1/c)^2} = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}$\n    $\\gamma_1 = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.36} = 1 / \\sqrt{0.64}$\n    $\\gamma_1 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25$\n\n    Now, calculate its energy, $E_1$:\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n    First, find its Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v_2/c)^2} = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}$\n    $\\gamma_2 = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.25} = 1 / \\sqrt{0.75}$\n    $\\gamma_2 \\approx 1 / 0.866 \\approx 1.1547$\n\n    Now, calculate its energy, $E_2$:\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2$\n    $E_{total} = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\n*   Our calculated relative speed is **0.14c**.\n*   Our calculated total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\nThese values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
