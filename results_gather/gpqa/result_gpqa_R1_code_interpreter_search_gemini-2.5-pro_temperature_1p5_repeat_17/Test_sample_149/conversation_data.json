    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for a saturated acyclic amine/amide is CnH2n+3N. For C8, this would be C8H19N. The given formula is C8H9NO. The difference in hydrogen atoms is (19+1(for O)) - 9 = 11. Wait, let's use the standard formula: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment (acetaldehyde group).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, are classic indicators of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to the aromatic ring. The strong electron-donating nature of the -NH2 group explains the upfield shift of the ortho protons (6.51 ppm), while the protons ortho to the other substituent are more downfield (6.98 ppm).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    The fragments are a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2-CHO group. Putting them together gives 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. The molecular formula C8H9NO is consistent with this structure.\n\n    **Starting Material (A):** 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) acetaldehyde](https://i.imgur.com/gK96tqA.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    This two-step sequence is a standard method to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The primary amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at 0-5 °C) to form a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water upon gentle warming. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n    This sequence converts the starting 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde into **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde (B)**.\n     ![Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetaldehyde](https://i.imgur.com/Fw8V43X.png)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This reagent provides a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate **(B)** is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). This sets up the conditions for an **aldol condensation**. Since the aldehyde reacts with itself, it's a self-aldol condensation.\n\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde. Subsequent protonation yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. In this case, it is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is the aldol condensation product.\n\n    Let's trace the formation of the condensation product from the aldol adduct:\n    Adduct: `HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(PhOH)-CHO`\n    Dehydration (loss of H from C-2 and OH from C-3) leads to the formation of a double bond between C-2 and C-3.\n    Final Product: `HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO`, which is named **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n     ![Final Product: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) but-2-enal](https://i.imgur.com/kS94b2q.png)\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product. The structure and name match our derived product.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it's missing the hydroxyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
