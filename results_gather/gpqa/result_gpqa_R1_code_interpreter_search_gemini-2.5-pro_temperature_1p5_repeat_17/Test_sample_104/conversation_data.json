    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two different phenomena that cause a star's brightness to dim:\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** A star with a large, cool spot region rotates. When the spotty side faces us, the star appears dimmer. When the unspotted side faces us, it appears brighter. We need to calculate the maximum relative dimming caused by these spots.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** An exoplanet passes in front of its star, blocking a small fraction of the starlight and causing a dip in brightness. The amount of dimming depends on the relative size of the planet and the star.\n\nThe goal is to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl / R_star`) that would cause the same amount of dimming as the rotating starspots.\n\n**2. Model the Flux from the Spotted Star**\n\nWe can model the flux (brightness) of the star using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (`T^4`).\n\nLet's define the two states of the star as seen from Earth:\n\n*   **`F_max` (Maximum Flux):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The entire visible disk has a temperature `T_star`. The flux is proportional to `A * T_star^4`, where `A` is the area of the visible stellar disk.\n*   **`F_min` (Minimum Flux):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere faces us.\n    *   The star's effective temperature is `T_star = 6000 K`.\n    *   The spots are 1000 K cooler, so `T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K`.\n    *   The spots cover the hemisphere with a filling factor `f = 0.20` (or 20%). We assume this means 20% of the visible disk is covered by spots when this hemisphere faces us.\n    *   Therefore, 20% of the disk's area radiates at `T_spot`, and the remaining 80% (`1 - f`) radiates at `T_star`.\n    *   The total flux in this state is a weighted average: `F_min` is proportional to `(1 - f) * A * T_star^4 + f * A * T_spot^4`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Amplitude of the Spot Signal**\n\nThe amplitude of the dimming signal caused by the spots is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum states.\n\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nWe can substitute our expressions for flux. The term for the disk area, `A`, will cancel out.\n\n`Amplitude = (T_star^4 - [(1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4]) / T_star^4`\n`Amplitude = (T_star^4 - T_star^4 + f * T_star^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_star^4`\n`Amplitude = (f * T_star^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_star^4`\n`Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_star^4))`\n`Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `f = 0.20`\n*   `T_star = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4)`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4)`\n\n**4. Model the Dimming from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of its area to the star's area. This is the transit depth.\n\n`Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star`\n`Transit Depth = (pi * R_pl^2) / (pi * R_star^2)`\n`Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n**5. Equate the Two Effects and Solve**\n\nThe problem asks for the planet size that produces the *same amplitude signal*. Therefore, we set the transit depth equal to the amplitude of the spot signal.\n\n` (R_pl / R_star)^2 = Amplitude`\n` (R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius, `R_pl / R_star`:\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4))`\n\nLet's compute the final value using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nT_star = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000  # Effective temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the flux variation due to rotational modulation\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# The transit depth for an exoplanet is (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# We set the amplitude from the spots equal to the transit depth\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = amplitude\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\n\nrelative_radius = np.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_radius:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.3218\n<<<\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.3218. This value is closest to the given option C.\n\nThe squared radius from the options gives the transit depth:\nA) `0.11^2 = 0.0121`\nB) `0.07^2 = 0.0049`\nC) `0.32^2 = 0.1024`\nD) `0.39^2 = 0.1521`\n\nThe amplitude we calculated for the spots is `0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.1035`. The value of `0.1024` from option C is the closest match.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, we need to equate the dimming caused by the starspots to the dimming caused by the planet's transit.\n\n### **1. Dimming due to Starspots**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating starspots. We can model the flux (energy radiated per unit area) using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **`T_star`**: Effective temperature of the star = 6000 K\n*   **`T_spot`**: Temperature of the dark spots = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **`f`**: Filling factor of spots on the active hemisphere = 20% = 0.20\n\nThe maximum flux (`F_max`) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk radiates at `T_star`. So, `F_max ∝ T_star⁴`.\n\nThe minimum flux (`F_min`) occurs when the spotty hemisphere faces the observer. In this case, a fraction `f` of the disk radiates at the cooler temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining fraction `(1 - f)` radiates at `T_star`.\nSo, `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux:\n\n`Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nSubstituting our expressions for flux (the proportionality constants and area will cancel out):\n\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`Amplitude_spot ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the star's brightness dips by about 10.36% due to the spots.\n\n### **2. Dimming due to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The amount of dimming (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### **3. Equating the Signals**\n\nThe problem requires that the amplitude of the signal from the hypothetical planet is the same as the amplitude from the starspots.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spot`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`), we take the square root of the amplitude:\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.32. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
