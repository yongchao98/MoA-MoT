    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution. The solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n    *   The key species for the buffer system are the conjugate acid-base pair: H2PO4- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base).\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial moles of the buffer components:**\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol. This gives 0.007348 mol of H2PO4-.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol. This gives 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**:\n    *   The pH of the solution is primarily determined by the equilibrium between H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which is governed by the second acid dissociation constant of phosphoric acid (Ka2).\n    *   The equilibrium is: H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n    *   The expression for Ka2 is: Ka2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   Using the given Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8 and the calculated concentrations:\n        [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). This equilibrium is governed by the third acid dissociation constant (Ka3).\n    *   The equilibrium is: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n    *   The expression for Ka3 is: Ka3 = ([H+][PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n    *   Since Ka3 is very small (1.8x10^-12), the equilibrium concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately equal to its initial concentration.\n    *   Using the given Ka3, the calculated [H+], and the initial [HPO4^2-]:\n        [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10^-8 M) ≈ 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform the calculation using a script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles\nmoles_KH2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_Na2HPO4_2H2O = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\n# Moles of H2PO4- are from KH2PO4\n# Moles of HPO4^2- are from Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_KH2PO4 / volume_L\nconc_HPO4 = moles_Na2HPO4_2H2O / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# We assume the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are close to their initial concentrations.\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\nconc_PO4 = (Ka3 * conc_HPO4) / conc_H\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4:.3e}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\nThe solution is made by dissolving KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O in water.\n*   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely in water to yield K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a salt that dissociates completely in water to yield 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and water molecules.\n*   The key components forming the buffer are the conjugate acid-base pair: H2PO4- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the base).\n\nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid, meaning it donates protons in three steps, each with its own acid dissociation constant (Ka):\n1.  H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5 x 10^-3)\n2.  H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8)\n3.  HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-  (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12)\n\nOur solution contains significant amounts of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, so the pH will be determined primarily by the second equilibrium (Ka2). The concentration of orthophosphate (PO4^3-) will be determined by the third equilibrium (Ka3).\n\n**2. Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations**\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of each component.\n*   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\nNext, calculate the initial molar concentrations. The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L.\n*   Initial concentration of H2PO4- : [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- : [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\nThe [H+] is controlled by the buffer equilibrium involving H2PO4- and HPO4^2-:\nH2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\nThe equilibrium expression is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]. We can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components with their initial concentrations because the dissociation is weak.\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] ≈ 8.113 x 10^-8 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**\nThe concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation step:\nHPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\nThe equilibrium expression is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\nWe use the [H+] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of HPO4^2- (since its dissociation is very small, its concentration remains virtually unchanged).\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.113 x 10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution `6.236e-07`, which rounds to 6.24 x 10^-7. Comparing this value to the given options:\nA) 5.48x10^-7 M\nB) 2.81x10^-7 M\nC) 3.97x10^-7 M\nD) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
