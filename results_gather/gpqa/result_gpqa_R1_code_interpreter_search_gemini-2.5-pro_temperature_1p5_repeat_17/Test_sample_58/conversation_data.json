    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol\n\n*   **Moles of HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of H+ = 0.08 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH⁻, the moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe reactions will occur in a specific order: the strong acid will react with the strong base first, and any remaining strong species will then react with the weak species.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n    *   The H+ from HCl reacts with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n    *   H⁺ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid**\n    *   The remaining OH⁻ will now react with the weak acid, CH3COOH.\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.10 mol\n    *   CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate the pH.**\n\nAfter all reactions are complete, the solution contains:\n*   Excess strong base (OH⁻): 0.05 mol\n*   The conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻): 0.05 mol\n*   No remaining CH₃COOH or H⁺.\n\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻), as its contribution will be far greater than that from the hydrolysis of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻.**\n    *   Total volume of the solution = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH.**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH.**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\n<<<B>>>"
