    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n**1. Understand the concept of density and its relation to mass and composition.**\n\n*   **Density** is defined as mass per unit volume (ρ = M/V).\n*   For celestial bodies like planets, the volume is determined by its radius (V = (4/3)πR³).\n*   A key physical principle for planets is **gravitational compression**. The more massive a planet is, the stronger its own gravity. This strong gravity compresses the material it's made of, forcing it into a smaller volume than it would otherwise occupy.\n*   Therefore, if you have two planets with the *same composition* (the same mix of elements like iron, silicon, etc.), the more massive one will be compressed more and will have a higher density.\n\n**2. Analyze each option based on this principle.**\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This is our baseline. Its density is the density of Earth, which is approximately **5.51 g/cm³**.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n    *   This planet's density is explicitly given as **~5.5 g/cm³**, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n    *   (Note: For a planet twice as massive as Earth but with the same density, it would need to be made of lighter materials to counteract the effect of gravitational compression).\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   **Mass:** 5 M_earth.\n    *   **Composition:** Same as Earth.\n    *   Because it is much more massive than Earth, its self-gravity will be much stronger. This will compress its iron core and rocky mantle significantly more than Earth's materials are compressed.\n    *   As a result, its overall density will be **greater than Earth's density**.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   **Mass:** 0.5 M_earth.\n    *   **Composition:** Same as Earth.\n    *   Because it is less massive than Earth, its self-gravity will be weaker. The materials will be less compressed.\n    *   As a result, its overall density will be **less than Earth's density**.\n\n**3. Compare the densities.**\n\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (significantly greater)\n*   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nComparing these values, the planet in option (c) clearly has the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
