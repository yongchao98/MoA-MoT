    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. In stellar astronomy, this typically refers to the number of stars found within a small interval of parallax, `d(plx)`. This can be written as a proportionality for the differential number count:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`) per unit range of distance. This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Find the Relationship between `dN/dr` and `dN/d(plx)`:**\n    To convert a derivative with respect to parallax into a derivative with respect to distance, we use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Establish the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    Parallax is defined as the reciprocal of the distance to the star (when distance is measured in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds).\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the expression for parallax with respect to distance:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r^2`\n    For proportionality, we are concerned with the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n    `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Chain Rule Equation:**\n    Now we can substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation from step 3:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express the Final Relationship in Terms of `r`:**\n    The final step is to replace the parallax term (`plx`) with its equivalent in terms of distance (`r = 1/plx`):\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    Simplify the expression:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nThus, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes in proportion to the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<D>>>"
