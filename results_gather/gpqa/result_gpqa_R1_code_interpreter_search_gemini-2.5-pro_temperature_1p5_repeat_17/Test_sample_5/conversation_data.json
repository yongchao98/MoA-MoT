    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    To simplify the problem, we convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    *   x = r * cos(θ)\n    *   y = r * sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    From these, we can identify a key term in the potential:\n    *   r^2 * cos^2(θ) = (r * cos(θ))^2 = x^2\n\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (x^2)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Combine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2) * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2) * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n4.  **Identify the Physical System:**\n    The simplified potential V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y) is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n    This means the system is a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in x and y.\n\n5.  **Solve the 1D Schrödinger Equations:**\n    The total energy E of the system will be the sum of the energies from the x and y motions: E = E_x + E_y.\n    The energy of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = 1/2 * k_eff * q^2 is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k_eff / m).\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2 = 1/2 * (4k) * x^2. The effective spring constant is k_x = 4k.\n        The angular frequency for the x-motion is:\n        ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n        The energy for the x-motion is:\n        E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2. The effective spring constant is k_y = k.\n        The angular frequency for the y-motion is:\n        ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)\n        The energy for the y-motion is:\n        E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of E_x and E_y:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    Factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [ 2 * (n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m).\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    D) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    The result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
