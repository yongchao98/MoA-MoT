    "This problem asks for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge. These potentials are derived from the general retarded potential formulas.\n\n### 1. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the potentials V and $\\vec{A}$ from a time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, the quantities in the integrand are evaluated at the *retarded time* $t_r$, which is defined by the condition that the field, traveling at speed c, must have been emitted at an earlier time $t_r$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the present time $t$.\n$t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be represented using Dirac delta functions:\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Scalar Potential (V)\n\nLet's substitute the charge density into the integral for V. The retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$, which makes the integral non-trivial.\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, one can show that the effect of the delta function's time-dependent argument is to introduce a correction factor in the denominator. A detailed derivation (which involves a change of variables and the properties of the Dirac delta function) yields:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| \\cdot (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t') \\cdot (\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t'))}{c|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t')|})} \\right]_{t'=t_r}$\n\nHere, all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the unique retarded time $t_r$ that satisfies $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$.\n\nLet's use the notation given in the problem:\n*   The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The distance is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n\nSubstituting this notation into the expression for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d \\cdot (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} \\right] = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}}$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Derivation of the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)\n\nThe derivation for the vector potential is almost identical. We start with:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe evaluation of the integral proceeds in the same way, but now we have $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ in the numerator:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe derived potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option D. The factor $(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects due to the motion of the source, including the Doppler effect.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) Has the wrong sign in the denominator (`+` instead of `-`).\n*   B) and C) Use the static potential form for V, which is only correct for a stationary charge. They are incorrect for a moving charge.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct representation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>"
