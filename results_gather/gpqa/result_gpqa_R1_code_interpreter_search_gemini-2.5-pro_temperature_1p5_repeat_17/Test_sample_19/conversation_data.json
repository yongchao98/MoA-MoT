    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that together define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's analyze the core idea and then each statement.\n\nThe **impulse approximation** is used in scattering problems involving a nucleus. The core idea is that if the interaction between a projectile (like an electron or neutrino) and the nucleus is very rapid and involves a large momentum transfer, the complex interactions between the nucleons inside the nucleus can be simplified. Specifically, the interaction is treated as a sudden \"impulse\" delivered to a single nucleon, which behaves as if it were a free particle during this brief moment. The other nucleons are considered mere \"spectators.\"\n\nLet's evaluate each of the four proposed statements based on this understanding:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is a foundational assumption. The impulse approximation explicitly simplifies the many-body problem by assuming the incoming probe interacts with just one nucleon at a time. It neglects more complex interactions, such as those involving pairs of nucleons (known as meson-exchange currents). This statement is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This addresses what happens before and after the main interaction. If the nucleus were not \"transparent,\" the incoming projectile could scatter off other nucleons before hitting the target one (initial-state interactions), or the outgoing particles (the projectile and the struck nucleon) could re-scatter within the nucleus before escaping (final-state interactions). Assuming transparency means neglecting these initial and final-state interactions, which is a key part of simplifying the problem to a clean, single-nucleon event. This statement is also essential.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not its behavior within the nuclear medium. The impulse approximation is about the nucleon's dynamics relative to the rest of the nucleus, not the dynamics of its constituent quarks. One can apply the impulse approximation even in regimes like deep inelastic scattering, where the quarks are treated as highly relativistic point-like particles. Therefore, this assumption about non-relativistic quarks is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation. It's a separate approximation used in some models of nucleon structure (like the non-relativistic quark model), but not a requirement for the impulse approximation itself.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very essence of treating the nucleon as \"free.\" A nucleon inside a nucleus is bound by the strong nuclear force, which affects its energy and momentum. The impulse approximation assumes the energy transferred during the collision is so much larger than the nucleon's binding energy, and the interaction time is so short, that the binding forces are negligible *during the interaction*. The nucleon is essentially \"frozen\" in its state for the duration of the impulse and reacts as a free particle would with that initial momentum. This statement is crucial.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe assumptions that jointly constitute the impulse approximation are:\n- The interaction is with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n- The rest of the nucleus does not interfere before or after the collision (Statement 2).\n- The nucleon's binding to the nucleus is ignored during the brief interaction (Statement 4).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of statements is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
