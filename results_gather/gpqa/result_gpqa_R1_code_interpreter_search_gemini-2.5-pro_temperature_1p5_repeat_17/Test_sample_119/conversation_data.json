    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the Fundamental Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, which we'll call `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere in three-dimensional space. `ρ` has units of (number of stars) / (volume), e.g., stars/parsec³.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Volume and Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars, `N`, within a sphere of radius `d` centered on Earth.\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    *   From this, we can see that the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is directly proportional to the cube of the distance: `N ∝ d³`.\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax:**\n    *   Astronomical parallax (`plx`) is defined as the inverse of the distance (`d`) to a star. The standard formula is `d = 1/plx`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n    *   We can rearrange this to `d ∝ 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Parallax:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the relationship between distance and parallax into our equation for the number of stars.\n    *   The number of stars `N` within a distance `d` corresponds to the number of stars that have a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx`. Why greater? Because a smaller distance means a larger parallax.\n    *   Let `N(>plx)` be the number of stars with parallax greater than or equal to `plx`.\n    *   `N(>plx) ∝ d³ ∝ (1/plx)³ = plx⁻³`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This is a rate, which in calculus terms is a derivative. We need to find `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We have the cumulative number of stars: `N(>plx) = C * plx⁻³`, where `C` is a constant of proportionality combining `ρ`, `π`, etc.\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N` with respect to `plx` to find the number of stars per unit parallax interval:\n        `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [C * plx⁻³]`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx(xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹`):\n        `dN/d(plx) = C * (-3 * plx⁻³⁻¹) = -3C * plx⁻⁴`\n\n6.  **Final Interpretation:**\n    *   The result `dN/d(plx) ∝ -plx⁻⁴` tells us the relationship we're looking for. The negative sign simply indicates that the cumulative count `N(>plx)` decreases as `plx` increases (which makes sense, as a larger minimum parallax corresponds to a smaller volume of space).\n    *   The physical quantity—the number of stars found in a small interval of parallax `d(plx)`—must be positive. We are interested in the magnitude of this relationship.\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `plx⁻⁴` or `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
