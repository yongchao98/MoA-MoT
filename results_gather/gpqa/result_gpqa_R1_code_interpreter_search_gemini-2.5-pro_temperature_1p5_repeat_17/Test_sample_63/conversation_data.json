    "Here's my thinking process to solve this chemistry problem:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\n*   **Reactants:** An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B.\n*   **Initial Mass:** 7.20 g.\n*   **Process:** Heated to 200°C, producing only a mixture of gases.\n*   **Analysis of Products:** The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes. This is a classic gas analysis setup.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent. Any increase in its mass is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater. It absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is from the oxygen atoms.\n*   **Quantitative Data:**\n    *   Mass increase of Tube №1 = 3.60 g (This is the mass of H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase of Tube №3 = 0.80 g (This is the mass of O).\n    *   Mass of Tube №2 did not change (This means no CO₂ was produced).\n    *   A final gas, C, of 2.24 L at STP remains.\n\n*   **Goal:** Find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B combined.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product**\n\nI'll use the provided data to find out what gases were produced and in what amounts.\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):**\n    *   Mass = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol\n\n*   **Oxygen (O₂):**\n    *   The mass increase in the copper tube is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO).\n    *   Mass of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of oxygen gas are half the moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Gas C:**\n    *   This is the gas that didn't react with the drying agent, limewater, or hot copper. The most common inert gas produced in the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L\n    *   Molar volume at STP = 22.4 L/mol\n    *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts (A and B)**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial salts A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol\n\n*   **Check for other elements:** Since the tube with Ca(OH)₂ didn't change weight, there is no carbon (no CO₂). We can calculate the total mass from H, N, and O to see if it matches the starting mass.\n    *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g\n    *   Mass N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g\n    *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g\n    *   Total Mass = 0.4 + 2.8 + 4.0 = 7.2 g.\n    *   This perfectly matches the initial 7.20 g, confirming that salts A and B are composed solely of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n**4. Identify the Chemical Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the mixture is equimolar, and we know the total elemental composition of the combined salts.\n\n*   The molar ratio of elements in the entire mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n*   To get integers, let's find the simplest whole-number ratio. Divide by the smallest value (0.20):\n    *   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiply by 4 to make all numbers integers:\n    *   N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n*   This N₄H₈O₅ represents the combined empirical formula for one molecule of salt A and one molecule of salt B (because they are in an equimolar mixture).\n*   Now, I need to split the formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible chemical formulas for salts containing N, H, and O. The most common are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. Let's look at the candidates:\n    *   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n    *   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   Let's see if these two add up to our combined formula:\n    *   (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅\n*   This is a perfect match! So, Salt A and Salt B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the atoms in the chemical formula of each salt and add them together.\n\n*   **Salt A (e.g., NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9\n\n*   **Total Number of Atoms (A + B):**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17. This corresponds to option B.\nI can double check the calculation using a python script.\n```python\n# Final calculation check\n# Salt A is NH4NO2, Salt B is NH4NO3\n\n# Atoms in Salt A (N2H4O2)\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Atoms in Salt B (N2H4O3)\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Total atoms\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms = {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "1.  **Analyze the Products from the Gas Analysis Train:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This tells us the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) according to the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas (2.24 L at STP) is inert to all the previous traps. In the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product:**\n    *   **Moles of Water (H₂O):**\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 1.0*2 + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O₂):**\n        *   The mass increase (0.80 g) is from oxygen atoms (O). Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol O.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol O₂.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N₂):**\n        *   At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of Salts A and B:**\n    By the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the water (H₂O). Each H₂O molecule has 2 H atoms.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the nitrogen gas (N₂). Each N₂ molecule has 2 N atoms.\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water (H₂O) and the oxygen gas (O₂).\n        *   Moles of O = (moles of H₂O) + 2 × (moles of O₂) = 0.20 mol + 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n4.  **Verify Composition and Identify the Salts:**\n    *   Let's check if the total mass of these elements equals the starting mass:\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g\n        *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g\n        *   Total Mass = 0.4 + 2.8 + 4.0 = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass perfectly.\n    *   The total molar ratio of elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To get a simple whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20): N₁ : H₂ : O₁.₂₅.\n    *   To eliminate the fraction, multiply all by 4: N₄ : H₈ : O₅.\n    *   This formula, N₄H₈O₅, represents the combined formula of one molecule of salt A and one molecule of salt B (since they are in an equimolar mixture). We must split this into two plausible salt formulas. Common salts containing only N, H, and O are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n        *   Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n        *   Ammonium Nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   Let's see if these two add up: (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, salt A is NH₄NO₂ and salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   Count the atoms in the formula for salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   Count the atoms in the formula for salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms is the sum of the atoms in both salts: 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
