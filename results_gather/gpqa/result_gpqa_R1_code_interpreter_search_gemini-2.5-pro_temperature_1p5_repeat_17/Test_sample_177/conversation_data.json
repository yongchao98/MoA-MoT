    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` and the renormalizability of the theory described by the Lagrangian `\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}`.\n\n### **1. Principle of Dimensional Analysis in Quantum Field Theory**\n\nIn natural units, where the reduced Planck constant `ħ` and the speed of light `c` are set to 1 (`ħ = c = 1`), the action `S` is dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over spacetime:\n\n`S = ∫ d⁴x L`\n\nFrom this, we can determine the mass dimension of `L`.\n*   The dimension of a spacetime interval `x` is `[x]_M = -1` (since `E = 1/t`, `p = 1/x`, and `E, p, m` all have mass dimension 1).\n*   The dimension of the four-volume element `d⁴x` is `[d⁴x]_M = [x]⁴ = (-1)⁴ = -4`.\n*   Since the action `S` is dimensionless, `[S]_M = 0`.\n*   Therefore, `[S]_M = [d⁴x]_M + [L]_M = 0`, which implies `-4 + [L]_M = 0`.\n*   So, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be `[L]_M = 4`.\n\n### **2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nWe need to find the mass dimensions of the fields `ψ` and `F^μν` by looking at their kinetic terms in a standard QFT Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion field `ψ`**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is `L_fermion_kin = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu)\\psi`.\n    *   The derivative `∂μ` has mass dimension `[∂μ]_M = 1`.\n    *   The gamma matrices `γμ` are dimensionless constants, so `[γμ]_M = 0`.\n    *   The dimensions of `ψ` and `\\bar{ψ}` are the same: `[ψ]_M = [\\bar{ψ}]_M`.\n    *   Using `[L]_M = 4`, we have: `[L_fermion_kin]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\gamma^\\mu]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M + [\\psi]_M = 4`.\n    *   `[ψ]_M + 0 + 1 + [ψ]_M = 4`.\n    *   `2[ψ]_M = 3`.\n    *   `[ψ]_M = 3/2`.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor `F^μν`**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field (a gauge boson) is `L_photon_kin = - (1/4) F_{μν}F^{μν}`.\n    *   Using `[L]_M = 4`, we have: `[L_photon_kin]_M = [F_{μν}]_M + [F^{μν}]_M = 4`.\n    *   Since `[F_{μν}]_M = [F^{μν}]_M`, we have `2[F^{μν}]_M = 4`.\n    *   `[F^{μν}]_M = 2`.\n\n*   **Tensor `σ_μν`**: The tensor `σ_μν` is defined as `σ_μν = (i/2)[\\gamma_μ, \\gamma_ν]`.\n    *   The factors `i` and `1/2` are dimensionless.\n    *   The gamma matrices `γμ` are dimensionless.\n    *   Therefore, `[σ_μν]_M = 0`.\n\n### **3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling `κ`**\n\nNow we can analyze the interaction Lagrangian `L_int = κ \\bar{\\psi} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}`. The dimension of any term in the Lagrangian must be 4.\n\n*   `[L_int]_M = [κ]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [σ_{μν}]_M + [ψ]_M + [F^{μν}]_M = 4`.\n*   Substituting the dimensions we found: `[κ]_M + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4`.\n*   `[κ]_M + 3 + 2 = 4`.\n*   `[κ]_M + 5 = 4`.\n*   `[κ]_M = -1`.\n\nThe mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` is -1.\n\n### **4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory is determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. The general rule (power-counting renormalizability) is:\n\n*   If `[coupling]_M > 0`, the theory is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If `[coupling]_M = 0`, the theory is **renormalizable**.\n*   If `[coupling]_M < 0`, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant is `κ` and its mass dimension is `[κ]_M = -1`. Since the mass dimension is negative, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nThis means that to cancel divergences in loop calculations, new counterterms with different structures are required at each order of perturbation theory, leading to an infinite number of parameters and a loss of predictive power at high energies. Such theories are typically interpreted as effective field theories, valid only up to an energy scale related to `1/|κ|`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of `κ` is `[κ]_M = -1`.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
