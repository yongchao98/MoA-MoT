    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the H-atom decay problem.

    The function verifies the answer based on two main physical principles:
    1. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules: Checks if the proposed decay path
       is physically allowed.
    2. Transition Probability: Calculates the correct probability for a single
       decay channel based on the symmetry of the initial state and compares
       it with the probability given in the option.
