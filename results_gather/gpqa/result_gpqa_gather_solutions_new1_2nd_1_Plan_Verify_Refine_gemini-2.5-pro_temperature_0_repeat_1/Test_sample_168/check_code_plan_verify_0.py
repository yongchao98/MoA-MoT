Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.

### Step 1: Analyze the Nature of the Energy Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)

The first key point is to determine if the energy spectrum of the `E` particles remains continuous or becomes discrete. This is determined by the number of particles in the final state of the decay.

*   **Principle:** In a particle decay, if the final state consists of only two particles, conservation of energy and momentum dictate that each particle must have a specific, fixed energy, resulting in a **discrete** spectrum (sharp lines). If the final state has three or more particles, the total decay energy can be shared among them in a continuous range of ways, resulting in a **continuous** spectrum for any of the products.
*   **Original Decay (`2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`):** The final state has the recoiling nucleus (containing 2B) and four light particles (2E, 2V). This is a multi-body decay, which correctly results in the stated continuous spectrum.
*   **Variant Decay (`2A -> 2B + 2E + M`):** The final state has the recoiling nucleus and three light particles (2E, M). Since this is also a multi-body decay (more than two final-state particles), the energy will still be shared among them.
*   **Conclusion 1:** The energy spectrum of the `E` particles must **remain continuous**. This is a point of near-unanimous agreement among the candidate answers. This conclusion immediately eliminates options A and D.

### Step 2: Analyze the Endpoint of the Spectrum (Increases vs. Decreases)

The second key point is to determine whether the endpoint of this continuous spectrum increases or decreases. The endpoint represents the maximum possible kinetic energy available to the particles of interest (the two `E` particles).

*   **Principle:** The total kinetic energy released in a decay (the Q-value) is the initial rest mass energy minus the final rest mass energy: `Q_kinetic = (m_initial - m_final) * c²`.
*   **Endpoint of Original Decay (Q):** The total kinetic energy available is the energy released by the nuclear transition minus the energy required to create the rest mass of the final light particles.
    `Q = (m(2A) - m(2B))c² - (2m_E c² + 2m_V c²)`.
    The problem describes `V` as a "much lighter particle," which implies it has a non-zero rest mass (`m_V > 0`). An amount of energy equal to `2m_V c²` is consumed to create the mass of the two `V` particles.
*   **Endpoint of Variant Decay (Q'):** The calculation is similar, but the two `V` particles are replaced by one `M` particle.
    `Q' = (m(2A) - m(2B))c² - (2m_E c² + m_M c²)`.
    The problem explicitly states that `M` is **massless** (`m_M = 0`).
    Therefore, `Q' = (m(2A) - m(2B))c² - 2m_E c²`.
*   **Comparison:** By comparing the two endpoints, we see that `Q'` is greater than `Q` by exactly the rest mass energy of the two `V` particles:
    `Q' - Q = 2m_V c²`.
    Since `m_V > 0`, the difference is positive.
*   **Conclusion 2:** More kinetic energy is available in the variant decay because no energy is "spent" creating the rest mass of the `V` particles. Therefore, the endpoint of the spectrum **increases**. This is also a point of near-unanimous agreement in the reasoning of the candidate answers.

### Final Decision

Combining the conclusions from both steps:
1.  The spectrum remains **continuous**.
2.  The endpoint **increases**.

Matching this to the provided options:
*   A) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases. (Incorrect)
*   B) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases. (Correct)
*   C) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases. (Incorrect)
*   D) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases. (Incorrect)

The correct choice is B. The widespread disagreement on the final letter among the candidate answers, despite their consistent physical reasoning, strongly suggests a clerical error or a mismatch in the option labels they were working with. The physical analysis is clear and points to a single answer.
