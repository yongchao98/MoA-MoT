The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16.

It used the standard formula for the mole fraction of a complex (`α₂`) with the given ligand concentration (`[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M) and stability constants (`β₁`=9, `β₂`=40, `β₃`=63, `β₄`=16).\n\n3.  **Filtering and Selection**: The calculation resulted in a theoretical percentage of approximately `16.916%`.

The mole fraction of the `n`-th complex, `αₙ`, is given by the formula:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n    where `βₙ` is the overall stability constant for the `n`-th complex, `[L]` is the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, and the summation in the denominator is over all possible complexes.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to the Specific Problem:**\n    We are interested in the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, so `n=2`. The ligand `L` is `SCN⁻`. The formula becomes:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n    The percentage is simply `α₂ * 100`.\n\n4.  **Identify and Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   Ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Numerator:** The term for the complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`.\n        Numerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator:** This is the sum of the terms for all possible species (including the free Co²⁺ ion, for which the term is 1).\n        *   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Fraction and Percentage:**\n        Fraction (α₂) = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n        Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** Nearly all candidate answers that show their work (Answers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) arrive at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%. This indicates a high degree of confidence in the calculation itself.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed for the calculation. This is a common feature in such problems. The assumption that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is valid because the ligand is in a tenfold excess compared to the metal ion.\n*   **Matching Result to Option:** The calculated value is 16.9%. The provided multiple-choice options are A) 16.9%, B) 42.3%, C) 38.1%, and D) 25.6%. The calculated result directly matches option A.\n*   **Errors in Candidate Answers:** A significant number of the candidate answers correctly calculate 16.9% but then select the wrong letter (e.g., Answer 2 selects B, Answer 3 selects C, Answer 4 selects D). This is a clear contradiction within those answers. The correct approach is to trust the robust and repeatedly verified calculation and match it to the corresponding option.\n\nBased on the consistent and verified calculation, the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the problem is required, paying close attention to the methodology and potential pitfalls identified in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the percentage of one specific complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Correct Approach:** The percentage of a specific complex species in an equilibrium mixture is determined by its mole fraction (α). The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, denoted as α₂, is calculated using the concentrations of the free ligand (`[SCN⁻]`) and the overall stability constants (β). The formula is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    The percentage is then `α₂ * 100`.\n\n3.  **Address Careful Points:**\n    *   **Relevance of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The provided total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not required for this calculation. As shown in the formula, the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out, making the percentage distribution of species independent of the total metal concentration (assuming the ligand concentration is known).\n    *   **Ligand Concentration:** The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since the ligand concentration is ten times greater than the total metal concentration, it is a valid and standard assumption to approximate the free equilibrium ligand concentration as being equal to the given total concentration. The amount of ligand consumed by complex formation is negligible.\n    *   **Arithmetic Precision:** The calculation must be performed carefully to avoid errors.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n        *   β₁ = 9\n        *   β₂ = 40\n        *   β₃ = 63\n        *   β₄ = 16\n\n    *   **Calculate the numerator (the term for the species of interest, [Co(SCN)₂]):**\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Calculate the denominator (the sum of terms for all species):**\n        *   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂):**\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Convert to percentage:**\n        Percentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ **16.9%**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. This value matches option B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many perform the calculation correctly, several fail to select the corresponding multiple-choice option. The correct calculation and the correct option are both necessary.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step evaluation to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Relevant Species:** The cobalt-containing species are the free ion `Co²⁺` and the complexes `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n\n3.  **Governing Principle:** The distribution of these species is governed by the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` and the overall stability constants (`β₁`, `β₂`, `β₃`, `β₄`). The percentage of any given complex can be found by calculating its mole fraction (`αₙ`) and multiplying by 100.\n\n4.  **Formula Derivation:** The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, denoted as `α₂`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`.\n    *   `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n    *   By expressing each species' concentration in terms of `[Co²⁺]`, `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leading to the general formula:\n        `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Calculation:** We substitute the given values into this formula:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    *   **Numerator:**\n        `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    *   **Denominator:**\n        `1 + (9 * 0.1¹) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n        `= 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n        `= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n        `= 2.3646`\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction (`α₂`):**\n        `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    *   **Percentage:**\n        `Percentage = α₂ * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. This corresponds to option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Formula:** The most critical step is using the correct formula for the mole fraction (`α₂`), which nearly all candidate answers did correctly.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not required to calculate the percentage distribution of the species. Its inclusion is likely to test whether one understands that the relative distribution depends only on the free ligand concentration.\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** It is assumed that the given `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` is the free equilibrium concentration. This is a reasonable assumption because the ligand is in ten-fold excess compared to the total metal ion concentration, so complex formation will not significantly deplete it.\n*   **Matching Result to Option:** The calculated value is `~16.9%`. A significant number of the candidate answers performed this calculation correctly but then selected the wrong letter (e.g., C or D) in their final answer. The value 16.9% corresponds directly to option B.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the analyses correctly calculate the percentage as ~16.9%. The discrepancies in the final answers arise from incorrectly matching this numerical result to the provided options. The correct match is 16.9% -> Option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Chemical Species and Data**\n*   **Metal Ion:** Co(II) or `Co²⁺`\n*   **Ligand:** Thiocyanate or `SCN⁻`\n*   **Complexes:** `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n*   **Given Concentrations:**\n    *   Total Cobalt, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M\n    *   Thiocyanate, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   **Given Stability Constants (Overall):**\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40` (for the complex of interest)\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation Strategy**\nThe percentage of any given complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is determined by its mole fraction, `αₙ`, multiplied by 100. The formula for the mole fraction is:\n\n`αₙ = ([MLₙ]) / c(M_total)`\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + ...)`\n\nFor our specific problem, we want to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so `n=2`. The formula becomes:\n\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100`\n\n**4. Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage* distribution of the species, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out during the derivation of the formula.\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since this concentration is 10 times larger than the total metal concentration, the amount of ligand consumed by complex formation is small. Therefore, we can safely approximate the free (equilibrium) ligand concentration as the given value, 0.1 M.\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Calculation**\nLet `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1`.\n\n*   **Calculate the numerator term (for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):**\n    `Numerator = β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Calculate the denominator terms (for all species):**\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺`: `1`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁ * L¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃ * L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄ * L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n\n*   **Sum the denominator terms:**\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the fraction (mole fraction `α₂`):**\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to percentage:**\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated value of `16.916%` is closest to option C, which is 16.9%. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents performed the calculation correctly, several made errors in mapping the result to the correct letter option. The calculation itself is robust and consistently points to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo decide the final answer, I will analyze the provided candidate answers and the problem itself.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Species:** The cobalt-containing species are the free ion `Co²⁺` and the complexes formed with the thiocyanate ligand `SCN⁻`: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:** The percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, denoted as `α₂`, is given by the formula:\n\n    α₂ = (Concentration of `[Co(SCN)₂]`) / (Total concentration of all cobalt species)\n\n    Using the overall stability constants (β), this formula becomes:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    The percentage is then `α₂ * 100`.\n\n4.  **List the Given Values:**\n    *   Thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constant β₁ = 9\n    *   Stability constant β₂ = 40\n    *   Stability constant β₃ = 63\n    *   Stability constant β₄ = 16\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Numerator:** The term for the complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`.\n        Numerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator:** This is the sum of terms for all species (including the free ion, for which the term is 1).\n        *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Percentage:**\n        Percentage = (Numerator / Denominator) * 100\n        Percentage = (0.4 / 2.3646) * 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 16.9%.

This is a common feature in such problems.\n*   **Critical Error in Candidate Answers:** A significant number of the candidate answers, despite performing the calculation correctly, fail to select the correct lettered option. For example, Answer 2 calculates 16.9% but chooses `<<<B>>>` (38.1%). Answer 3 calculates 16.9% but chooses `<<<C>>>` (42.3%). This appears to be a recurring error in the provided candidate responses.\n*   **Conclusion:** The calculation consistently and correctly yields ~16.9%. This value directly matches option A. The conclusions of the other agents (B, C, D) are inconsistent with their own calculations.\n\nBased on a careful, step-by-step recalculation of the problem, the correct percentage is 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution containing a metal M and a ligand L is determined by its mole fraction, `αₙ`, multiplied by 100. The formula for the mole fraction is derived from the definitions of the overall stability constants (β). As correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers, the formula is:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor our specific case, we want to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so `n=2`. The formula becomes:\n\n`Percentage = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100`\n\n**3.

Careful Points and Considerations**\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed to calculate the relative percentage of the species. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. This information is likely included to test whether the solver understands which values are necessary.\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. In this type of problem, this is typically assumed to be the free (equilibrium) concentration of the ligand. This assumption is reasonable because the ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), so the amount of ligand consumed by complex formation is relatively small.\n*   **Arithmetic Precision:** The calculation involves several steps with decimals and powers. It is crucial to perform the arithmetic correctly to arrive at the right answer.\n\n**5.

Final Decision**\nThe calculated value is approximately **16.9%**. This matches option D.\n\nSeveral candidate answers (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12) performed the calculation correctly but then selected the wrong multiple-choice letter.

Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex in a mixture of complexes can be found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction for a complex `[MLₙ]` is given by the formula:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor our specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, n=2. The formula becomes:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. List the Given Values**\n*   Ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, β₁ = 9\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₂]`, β₂ = 40\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, β₃ = 63\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`, β₄ = 16\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, calculate the numerator of the fraction, which corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n\nSum the terms to get the denominator:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nNow, calculate the mole fraction (α₂):\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5.

The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (`α₂`) is given by the formula:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    This formula correctly relates the concentration of the target species to the sum of the concentrations of all possible species (free ion `Co²⁺` represented by the '1' in the denominator, and the four complexes).\n\n3.  **List the Given Values:**\n    *   Concentration of thiocyanate, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `β₁` = 9\n    *   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `β₂` = 40\n    *   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `β₃` = 63\n    *   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`, `β₄` = 16\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M\n\n4.  **Careful Points & Assumptions:**\n    *   The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for this calculation because the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out when deriving the mole fraction formula. Its inclusion is likely to test the understanding of this concept.\n    *   The problem provides `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.

This shows a strong consensus on the mathematical procedure.\n*   **Matching Result to Option:** A significant point of failure among the candidate answers was correctly matching the calculated result (`16.9%`) to the corresponding letter option (`B`). Answers 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15 all made errors in this final step, selecting C or D despite their correct calculations. Only Answers 2 and 5 correctly performed the calculation and selected option B.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not required to calculate the percentage distribution of the complexes, as the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out. This information is likely included to test whether one understands that the relative distribution depends only on the free ligand concentration, not the total metal concentration.\n*   **Ligand Concentration Assumption:** The problem states `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. As the total metal concentration (0.01 M) is significantly lower than the ligand concentration, it is a valid and standard assumption to approximate the free equilibrium ligand concentration as being equal to the given total concentration.\n\nBased on a thorough re-calculation and analysis of the candidate responses, the correct numerical answer is unequivocally `16.9%`, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step re-evaluation of the problem, here is a definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Chemical Species:** The species in equilibrium are the free cobalt ion (`Co²⁺`) and the series of complexes formed with the thiocyanate ligand (`SCN⁻`): `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n\n3.  **Select the Correct Formula:** The percentage of any given complex can be found by calculating its mole fraction (`αₙ`) and multiplying by 100.

This is a standard chemical equilibrium problem involving complex ions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]` out of the total cobalt concentration. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]` and multiplying by 100.\n\n2.  **Define the System:** The solution contains a central metal ion, `Co²⁺`, and a ligand, `SCN⁻`. They form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free ion and all complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mole Fraction (α₂):** The mole fraction of the `n=2` complex, `α₂`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n4.  **Use Stability Constants (β):** The concentration of any complex `[Co(SCN)ₙ]` can be expressed in terms of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constant `βₙ`:\n    `[[Co(SCN)ₙ]] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\n5.  **Derive the Calculation Formula:** By substituting the expressions for each species into the mole fraction formula, the `[Co²⁺]` term, which is common to the numerator and every term in the expanded denominator, cancels out. This leaves a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    The percentage is simply `α₂ * 100`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The problem gives `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` and `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since the ligand concentration is ten times the total metal concentration, the ligand is in large excess. This means the amount of `SCN⁻` consumed to form complexes is negligible compared to its total concentration. Therefore, we can safely approximate the free (equilibrium) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as this distribution only depends on the free ligand concentration. This information is extraneous for this specific question.\n\n### Deterministic Verification\n\nUsing the derived formula and the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\n1.  **Calculate the numerator term (for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):**\n    `Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n2.  **Calculate the denominator terms:**\n    *   Term 0 (for `Co²⁺`): 1\n    *   Term 1 (for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`): `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term 2 (for `[Co(SCN)₂]`): `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term 3 (for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`): `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term 4 (for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`): `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n\n3.  **Sum the denominator:**\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n4.  **Calculate the fraction and percentage:**\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\nRounding to one decimal place gives 16.9%. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of one specific cobalt-containing species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Formula**\nThis percentage is determined by calculating the mole fraction (α) of the species of interest and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is given by the formula:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor our specific case, we are interested in the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, so n=2. The formula becomes:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage is then `α₂ * 100`.\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration**: The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. The total cobalt concentration is `c(Co) = 0.01 M`. Since the ligand is in a tenfold excess compared to the metal ion, the amount of ligand consumed to form the complexes is small. Therefore, it is a standard and safe assumption to approximate the free equilibrium concentration of the ligand, `[SCN⁻]`, as the given total concentration, 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out from the mole fraction formula. This information is extraneous for this specific question.\n*   **Arithmetic Accuracy**: The final answer depends on performing the calculation correctly.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\nLet's substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺: **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction (α₂) and the percentage:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ **16.916%**\n\n**5. Conclusion and Analysis of Candidate Answers**\nThe calculated value is approximately 16.9%. This matches option B.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided candidate answers, a clear pattern emerges:\n*   The vast majority of the answers (Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the result of ~16.9%.\n*   However, most of these answers then incorrectly select option C or D as their final choice, contradicting their own mathematical work.\n*   Only Answer 2 and Answer 5 correctly perform the calculation AND map the result to the correct multiple-choice option, B.\n\nThe error in the other answers is not in the chemical or mathematical reasoning, but in the final step of matching the result to the given options.

The primary source of discrepancy in their final answers is a failure to correctly map this numerical result to the corresponding lettered option. This is likely due to the agents being presented with randomized option lists.

The mole fraction of the `n`-th complex, `αₙ`, is given by the formula:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n    where `βₙ` is the overall stability constant for the `n`-th complex, `[L]` is the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, and the summation in the denominator is over all possible complexes.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to the Specific Problem:**\n    We are interested in the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, so `n=2`.

This is a common feature in such problems. The assumption that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is valid because the ligand is in a tenfold excess compared to the metal ion.\n*   **Matching Result to Option:** The calculated value is 16.9%.

As shown in the formula, the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out, making the percentage distribution of species independent of the total metal concentration (assuming the ligand concentration is known).\n    *   **Ligand Concentration:** The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.

The percentage of any given complex can be found by calculating its mole fraction (`αₙ`) and multiplying by 100.\n\n4.  **Formula Derivation:** The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, denoted as `α₂`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`.\n    *   `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n    *   By expressing each species' concentration in terms of `[Co²⁺]`, `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leading to the general formula:\n        `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Calculation:** We substitute the given values into this formula:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    *   **Numerator:**\n        `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    *   **Denominator:**\n        `1 + (9 * 0.1¹) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n        `= 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n        `= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n        `= 2.3646`\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction (`α₂`):**\n        `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    *   **Percentage:**\n        `Percentage = α₂ * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%.

The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, denoted as `α₂`, is given by the formula:\n\n    α₂ = (Concentration of `[Co(SCN)₂]`) / (Total concentration of all cobalt species)\n\n    Using the overall stability constants (β), this formula becomes:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    The percentage is then `α₂ * 100`.\n\n4.  **List the Given Values:**\n    *   Thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constant β₁ = 9\n    *   Stability constant β₂ = 40\n    *   Stability constant β₃ = 63\n    *   Stability constant β₄ = 16\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Numerator:** The term for the complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`.\n        Numerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator:** This is the sum of terms for all species (including the free ion, for which the term is 1).\n        *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Percentage:**\n        Percentage = (Numerator / Denominator) * 100\n        Percentage = (0.4 / 2.3646) * 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 16.9%. This corresponds to option A.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Methodology:** Nearly all candidate answers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) correctly identify the formula and perform the calculation, arriving at the value of ~16.9%.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed for this calculation, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out of the fraction. This is a common feature in such problems.\n*   **Critical Error in Candidate Answers:** A significant number of the candidate answers, despite performing the calculation correctly, fail to select the correct lettered option. For example, Answer 2 calculates 16.9% but chooses `<<<B>>>` (38.1%). Answer 3 calculates 16.9% but chooses `<<<C>>>` (42.3%). This appears to be a recurring error in the provided candidate responses.\n*   **Conclusion:** The calculation consistently and correctly yields ~16.9%. This value directly matches option A. The conclusions of the other agents (B, C, D) are inconsistent with their own calculations.\n\nBased on a careful, step-by-step recalculation of the problem, the correct percentage is 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution containing a metal M and a ligand L is determined by its mole fraction, `αₙ`, multiplied by 100. The formula for the mole fraction is derived from the definitions of the overall stability constants (β). As correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers, the formula is:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor our specific case, we want to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so `n=2`. The formula becomes:\n\n`Percentage = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100`\n\n**3. List the Given Values**\n*   Ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constants: `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`\n\n**4. Careful Points and Considerations**\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed to calculate the relative percentage of the species. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. This information is likely included to test whether the solver understands which values are necessary.\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. In this type of problem, this is typically assumed to be the free (equilibrium) concentration of the ligand. This assumption is reasonable because the ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), so the amount of ligand consumed by complex formation is relatively small.\n*   **Arithmetic Precision:** The calculation involves several steps with decimals and powers. It is crucial to perform the arithmetic correctly to arrive at the right answer.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nLet's verify the calculation shown in the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Calculate the numerator term (for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):**\n    `Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Calculate all terms in the denominator:**\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺`: `1`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n\n*   **Sum the denominator terms:**\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the fraction (mole fraction α₂):**\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to percentage:**\n    `Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**6. Final Decision**\nThe calculated value is approximately **16.9%**. This matches option D.\n\nSeveral candidate answers (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12) performed the calculation correctly but then selected the wrong multiple-choice letter. The agents that correctly matched their calculation to the options (e.g., 1, 4, 11, 15) all arrived at option D.

Calculation:**\n*   **Numerator:** `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator:** `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n*   **Percentage:** `(0.4 / 2.3646) * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**4.

Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex in a mixture of complexes can be found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction for a complex `[MLₙ]` is given by the formula:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor our specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, n=2. The formula becomes:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3.

Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, calculate the numerator of the fraction, which corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n\nSum the terms to get the denominator:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nNow, calculate the mole fraction (α₂):\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5.

The formula becomes:\n`Percentage = α₂ * 100 = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100`\n\nThis formula is correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers (e.g., Answers 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15). This establishes a strong consensus on the correct method.\n\n**3.

This is a standard chemical equilibrium problem involving complex ions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]` out of the total cobalt concentration. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]` and multiplying by 100.\n\n2.  **Define the System:** The solution contains a central metal ion, `Co²⁺`, and a ligand, `SCN⁻`. They form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free ion and all complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mole Fraction (α₂):** The mole fraction of the `n=2` complex, `α₂`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n4.  **Use Stability Constants (β):** The concentration of any complex `[Co(SCN)ₙ]` can be expressed in terms of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constant `βₙ`:\n    `[[Co(SCN)ₙ]] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\n5.  **Derive the Calculation Formula:** By substituting the expressions for each species into the mole fraction formula, the `[Co²⁺]` term, which is common to the numerator and every term in the expanded denominator, cancels out. This leaves a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    The percentage is simply `α₂ * 100`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The problem gives `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` and `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since the ligand concentration is ten times the total metal concentration, the ligand is in large excess. This means the amount of `SCN⁻` consumed to form complexes is negligible compared to its total concentration. Therefore, we can safely approximate the free (equilibrium) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as this distribution only depends on the free ligand concentration. This information is extraneous for this specific question.\n\n### Deterministic Verification\n\nUsing the derived formula and the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\n1.  **Calculate the numerator term (for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):**\n    `Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n2.  **Calculate the denominator terms:**\n    *   Term 0 (for `Co²⁺`): 1\n    *   Term 1 (for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`): `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term 2 (for `[Co(SCN)₂]`): `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term 3 (for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`): `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term 4 (for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`): `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n\n3.  **Sum the denominator:**\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n4.  **Calculate the fraction and percentage:**\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\nRounding to one decimal place gives 16.9%. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of one specific cobalt-containing species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Formula**\nThis percentage is determined by calculating the mole fraction (α) of the species of interest and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is given by the formula:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor our specific case, we are interested in the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, so n=2. The formula becomes:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage is then `α₂ * 100`.\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Ligand Concentration**: The problem gives `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. The total cobalt concentration is `c(Co) = 0.01 M`. Since the ligand is in a tenfold excess compared to the metal ion, the amount of ligand consumed to form the complexes is small. Therefore, it is a standard and safe assumption to approximate the free equilibrium concentration of the ligand, `[SCN⁻]`, as the given total concentration, 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out from the mole fraction formula. This information is extraneous for this specific question.\n*   **Arithmetic Accuracy**: The final answer depends on performing the calculation correctly.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\nLet's substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺: **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction (α₂) and the percentage:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ **16.916%**\n\n**5.
