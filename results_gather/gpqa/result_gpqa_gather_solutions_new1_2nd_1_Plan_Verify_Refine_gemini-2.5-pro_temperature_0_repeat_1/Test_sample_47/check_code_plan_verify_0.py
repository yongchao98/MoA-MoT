Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting the key points.

### Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence

The first task is to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4, by following the reaction sequence. There is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on this pathway.

*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1**
    *   This is a standard α-bromination of a ketone. A bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.
    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**

*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 + NaOH, heat → Product 2**
    *   **Careful Point:** This step involves an α-halo ketone reacting with a strong base. The most plausible and characteristic reaction is the **Favorskii rearrangement**, which involves a ring contraction. An alternative, like an elimination reaction, is ruled out because the subsequent step requires a carboxylic acid.
    *   The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring.
    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**

*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), pyridine → Product 3**
    *   This is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The -OH group is replaced by a -Cl atom.
    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**

*   **Reaction 4: Product 4 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**
    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.
    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**

The final product is unambiguously identified as **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.

### Step 2: Analysis of Product 4 for Chemically Distinct Hydrogens

The second task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.

*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.

*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**
    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)
    2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon directly bonded to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)
    3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are not equivalent to each other.
        *   **Careful Point:** They are **diastereotopic** because C1 is a prochiral center. One proton is on the same side of the ring as the aldehyde group ("cis"), and the other is on the opposite side ("trans"). The two "cis" protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two "trans" protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **two** distinct types of hydrogens from these four protons.
    4.  **The C3 and C4 Protons:** Similarly, carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another **two** distinct types of hydrogens.

*   **Total Count:** Summing the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**.

### Conclusion

The chemical reasoning across almost all candidate answers correctly identifies the final product as cyclopentanecarbaldehyde and correctly calculates that it has **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. The discrepancies in the final letter choices of the candidates appear to be clerical errors or were based on different option mappings.

Based on the provided options in the question:
A) 6
B) 8
C) 7
D) 10

The calculated number of 6 corresponds to option A.
