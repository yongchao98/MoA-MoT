    # Constraint 1: The area of a surface must be a single scalar value.
    # Options C and D are functions of coordinates x and y, not scalars.
    # Thus, they are invalid answers for a total area.
    
    # Constraint 2: The area must be positive.
    # The area element is dA = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) dx dy.
    # The domain is x^2 + y^2 < 4, which means the denominator (4 - x^2 - y^2) is always positive.
    # Integrating a strictly positive function over a region of non-zero size must yield a positive result.
    # This eliminates option A (0).
    
    # By logical elimination alone, only option B (+infinity) remains as a possibility.
