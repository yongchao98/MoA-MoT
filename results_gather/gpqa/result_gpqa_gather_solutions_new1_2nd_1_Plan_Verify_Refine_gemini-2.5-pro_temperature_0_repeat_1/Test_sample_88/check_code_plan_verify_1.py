    # --- Step-by-step Chemical Verification ---

    # Step 1: Deduction of Product 1
    # Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH/240C.
    # Clues: IR at 1720 cm-1 (ketone), 14 protons (C10H14O formula).
    # Conclusion: This is a known skeletal rearrangement.
    product_1 = "protoadamantan-4-one"

    # Step 2: Deduction of Product 2
    # Reaction: Product 1 (ketone) + Al(OiPr)3/heat.
    # Clue: The next step is ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond.
    # Conclusion: The reaction is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction to an alcohol,
    # followed by heat-induced dehydration to an alkene.
    product_2 = "protoadamantene"

    # Step 3: Deduction of Product 3
    # Reaction: Product 2 (protoadamantene) + O3, then DMS.
    # Logic: This is a reductive ozonolysis. Protoadamantene has a disubstituted double bond (R-CH=CH-R').
    # Cleavage of such a bond yields two aldehyde groups. A common error is to assume a tetrasubstituted
    # alkene, which would yield two ketones. This is chemically incorrect for protoadamantene.
    correct_product_3 = "bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde"
    
    # Step 4: NMR Analysis of Product 3
    # Structure: bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.
    # Question: Coupling pattern of the *most deshielded* non-exchangeable hydrogen.

    # Path A: Literal interpretation - The Aldehyde Proton
    # The aldehyde protons (-CHO) are the most deshielded (9-10 ppm).
    # Coupling to the adjacent methine proton (H3/H7) would give a doublet.
    # "Doublet" is not an option. This suggests this is not the intended answer.

    # Path B: "NMR Problem Trope" Interpretation - The Methine Proton
    # This common problem-solving technique assumes that since the simplest pattern for the most deshielded proton isn't an option,
    # the question is actually about the *next* most deshielded proton, which has a more complex pattern listed in the options.
    # The next most deshielded protons are the methine protons (H3/H7), alpha to the aldehyde.
    # In the stable dual-chair conformation, the bulky -CHO groups are equatorial, making H3/H7 axial.
    # An axial proton (H3) is coupled to its four neighbors: two axial protons (H2ax, H4ax) and two equatorial protons (H2eq, H4eq).
    # Due to symmetry, the two axial neighbors are equivalent, and the two equatorial neighbors are also equivalent.
    # Coupling to two equivalent axial protons (large J-value) gives a triplet.
    # Each line of this triplet is then split by two equivalent equatorial protons (small J-value) into another triplet.
    # The resulting pattern is a "triplet of triplets".
    
    # Conclusion of Analysis: Path B ("triplet of triplets") represents the most standard and likely intended interpretation for this type of problem.
