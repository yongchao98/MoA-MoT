    Checks the correctness of the answer to the enamine reaction question.

    The function verifies two key aspects:
    1. The chemical validity of the reagent sequence. A multi-step synthesis
       requires separate steps for base, alkylating agent, and acid workup.
    2. The identity of the final product. An alkylation of pentan-2-one (5C)
       with an ethyl group (2C) under kinetic control (bulky base LDA)
       should yield heptan-4-one (7C).
