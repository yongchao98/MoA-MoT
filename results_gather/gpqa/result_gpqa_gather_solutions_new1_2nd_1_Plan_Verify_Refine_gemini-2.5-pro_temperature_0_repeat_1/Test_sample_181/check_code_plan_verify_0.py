    Checks if the provided LLM answer correctly identifies the conditions for the
    validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.

    The code verifies the answer based on four key physical principles:
    1. Carrier Type: Must be a single-carrier device.
    2. Material Purity: Must be trap-free.
    3. Injection Contact: Must be Ohmic (no injection barrier), not Schottky.
    4. Transport Mechanism: Must be drift-dominated (negligible diffusion current).

    # The final answer from the LLM to be checked.
    llm_answer_text = """
    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

    ### Step 1: Synthesize the Core Physical Assumptions
    The first step is to analyze the provided candidate answers to find a consensus on the fundamental physical assumptions required for the Mott-Gurney equation to be valid. A thorough review of all 15 answers reveals a strong agreement on the following four conditions:

    1.  **Carrier Type:** The model is unipolar, meaning it applies to a **single-carrier device**. The presence of a second mobile carrier type would introduce recombination, which is not accounted for.
    2.  **Material Purity:** The simple $J \propto V^2$ relationship is derived for an ideal material that is **trap-free**. The presence of traps would capture carriers and alter the current-voltage relationship.
    3.  **Injection Contact:** For the current to be limited by the bulk space charge, the contact must be able to supply an unlimited number of carriers. This requires an **Ohmic contact**, which is defined in this context as having **no carrier injection barrier**. A Schottky contact, which has a barrier, would lead to a different, injection-limited current regime.
    4.  **Transport Mechanism:** The model assumes the current is dominated by the drift of carriers in the applied electric field. The contribution from **diffusion current** (due to concentration gradients) is considered **negligible**.

    ### Step 2: Evaluate Each Option Against the Core Assumptions
    Now, we will systematically evaluate each of the original options (A, B, C, D) against this established set of four physical principles.

    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**
        *   **Careful Point:** This statement is incorrect because it claims the **drift current** is negligible. The Space-Charge-Limited Current is fundamentally a drift-dominated current; it is the diffusion current that is negligible.

    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**
        *   **Careful Point:** This statement is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is a **single-carrier** model.

    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**
        *   **Careful Point:** This statement is incorrect because a **Schottky contact** has an energy barrier that impedes carrier injection. The Mott-Gurney law requires an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier) to ensure the current is limited by space charge, not by injection.

    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**
        *   **Careful Point:** This statement is **correct**. It accurately combines all four necessary conditions:
            1.  `trap-free`
            2.  `single-carrier device`
            3.  `no carrier injection barrier` (the ideal Ohmic contact condition)
            4.  `negligible diffusion current` (implying drift dominance)

    ### Step 3: Final Conclusion
    The analysis shows that only statement D correctly and completely describes the set of conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid. The reasoning presented in the candidate answers, despite their differing final letter choices (due to randomized option ordering), converges on these same physical principles.
