    An analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the underlying chemical principles, but frequent errors in matching the derived chemical order to the given options.

    ### Step-by-step Analysis

    **1. Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**

    The most significant factor determining the para-isomer yield is the directing effect of the substituent. We can separate the six compounds into two distinct groups:

    *   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield)**
        These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.
        *   4) C₆H₅-**NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)
        *   6) C₆H₅-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)
        *   2) C₆H₅-**COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)

    *   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield)**
        These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.
        *   1) C₆H₅-**CH₃** (Toluene)
        *   5) C₆H₅-**C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene)
        *   3) C₆H₅-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)

    A correct final sequence must place all compounds from Group 1 before all compounds from Group 2.

    **2. Order the Meta-Directing Group (Lowest Para-Yields)**

    For meta-directors, the small amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A more powerful deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer.

    *   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.
    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.

    **3. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group (Highest Para-Yields)**

    For this group, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic effects.

    *   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.
    *   **Comparing with the Chloro Group (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, it is highly para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive electron withdrawal deactivates the closer ortho positions more strongly than the farther para position. This electronic effect, combined with its size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data confirms that the para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene (~87%) is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.
    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.

    **4. Assemble the Final Sequence**

    By combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:

    (Group 1) < (Group 2)
    **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**

    The final, complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.

    ### Conclusion and Analysis of Candidate Answers

    The derived chemical sequence is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.

    Now, we must match this sequence to the options provided in the original question:
    A) 4<6<2<1<5<3
    B) 3<5<1<6<2<4
    C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
    D) 6<2<4<5<1<3

    The derived sequence is an exact match for **Option A**.

    A review of the 15 candidate answers shows that virtually all of them correctly deduce the chemical sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. However, most of them make a critical error in the final step by matching this sequence to the wrong letter (B, C, or D). This indicates they were likely working from a shuffled or incorrect list of options. Only candidates 7 and 13 correctly performed both the chemical analysis and the final matching step.
