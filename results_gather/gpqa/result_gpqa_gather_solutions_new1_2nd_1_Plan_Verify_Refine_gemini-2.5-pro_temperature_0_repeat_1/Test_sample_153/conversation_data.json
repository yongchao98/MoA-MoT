All four candidates fit this description, so none are eliminated.\n3.  **IR Spectroscopy Constraint:** The data (broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) and option B (Phenyl chloroformate), leaving the two benzoic acid isomers, C and D.\n4.  **¹H NMR Constraint:** The NMR data shows a carboxylic acid proton (11.0 ppm) and, crucially, a pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons. This is the classic pattern for a 1,4- (para) disubstituted benzene ring. This pattern perfectly matches option D (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and eliminates option C (2-chlorobenzoic acid), which is ortho-substituted and would have a more complex pattern.\n\nThe only candidate to survive all constraints is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: --- Initial Hypotheses ---\nOption A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\nOption B: Phenyl chloroformate\nOption C: 2-chlorobenzoic acid\nOption D: 4-chlorobenzoic acid\n----------------------------------------\n--- Applying MS Constraint (MW ~156, 1 Cl atom) ---\nAll candidates are consistent with the MS data.\nSurviving Candidates:\nOption A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\nOption B: Phenyl chloroformate\nOption C: 2-chlorobenzoic acid\nOption D: 4-chlorobenzoic acid\n----------------------------------------\n--- Applying IR Constraint (Carboxylic Acid group) ---\nEliminated: A (aldehyde/phenol) and B (chloroformate).\nSurviving Candidates:\nOption C: 2-chlorobenzoic acid\nOption D: 4-chlorobenzoic acid\n----------------------------------------\n--- Applying 1H NMR Constraint (Para-substituted ring pattern) ---\nEliminated: C (2-chlorobenzoic acid) due to its 'ortho' pattern.\nSurviving Candidates:\nOption D: 4-chlorobenzoic acid\n----------------------------------------\n--- Final Conclusion ---\nOnly one candidate, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, survives all constraints.\n\nSELECTED FINAL CHOICE:\nOption D: 4-chlorobenzoic acid\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The M⁺ peak indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotope of each element. The M+2 peak's intensity (32% of M⁺, a ratio of approximately 3:1) is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This data confirms the molecular formula for all four options (C₇H₅ClO₂) is correct, as they all have a molecular weight of ~156.5 g/mol. The MS data alone does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The combination of these two signals is a classic fingerprint for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extremely broad peak is the O-H stretch, broadened by strong hydrogen bonding. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This information allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n        *   **Eliminate B) Phenyl chloroformate:** It lacks an O-H group.\n        *   **Eliminate A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** It is an aldehyde and a phenol. While it has O-H and C=O groups, the IR signature of a carboxylic acid (the extremely broad O-H stretch) is unique and matches the data perfectly. The ¹H NMR will later confirm this elimination.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is either 2-chlorobenzoic acid or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Data:** A singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n    *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm** is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   The signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm) are the key to determining the substitution pattern. There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H). The pattern of **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para isomer results in only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This NMR splitting pattern is the deciding factor.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It is unsymmetrical and would have four chemically distinct aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex spectrum (four separate signals), not two simple doublets.\n        *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). Its symmetry perfectly matches the observed NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the data, we can definitively identify the compound. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with the correct molecular weight. The IR and the NMR peak at 11.0 ppm confirm it is a carboxylic acid. The aromatic pattern in the NMR spectrum proves it has a 1,4-(para) substitution pattern. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Careful Point:** All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a nominal mass of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope). Therefore, the mass spectrum confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a definitive feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its frequency is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (an aldehyde/phenol) and **C) Phenyl chloroformate** (a chloroformate ester with no O-H group). This leaves the two isomers, 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid, as the only possibilities.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The crucial information is the splitting pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n*   **Careful Point:** This highly symmetrical pattern is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The molecule has an axis of symmetry, which makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other into doublets.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a para-substituted molecule and perfectly matches this NMR pattern.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is an ortho-substituted molecule. It lacks this symmetry, and its four aromatic protons are all chemically distinct. This would result in a more complex spectrum with four separate signals, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe mass spectrum confirms a molecular formula of C₇H₅ClO₂. The IR and NMR data confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The ¹H NMR splitting pattern specifically proves that the substituents on the benzene ring are in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and another peak (M+2) at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak.\n*   **Interpretation:** The M⁺ to M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecule with the ³⁵Cl isotope, and the peak at m/z = 158 corresponds to the molecule with the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n*   **Careful Point:** This data confirms the molecular weight (156 g/mol for the most abundant isotope) and the presence of one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this finding, so this step alone is not sufficient to distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum displays a very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, with its specific frequency being consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is powerful evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that do not contain this group.\n    *   **Eliminated:** Phenyl chloroformate (C) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D).\n    *   **Remaining:** 4-chlorobenzoic acid (A) and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B).\n\n### **3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows three signals: a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm (1H)** is in the characteristic chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The key information is the splitting pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H).\n*   **Careful Point:** This symmetrical pattern is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other into two doublets.\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (A)** is para-substituted and would produce this exact pattern.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (B)** is ortho-substituted. It lacks the necessary symmetry, and its four aromatic protons are all in unique chemical environments. This would result in a more complex spectrum with four separate signals, not two simple doublets.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nBy combining the evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques:\n1.  **MS** confirms the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n2.  **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, eliminating options C and D.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the para-substitution pattern of the aromatic ring, eliminating option B.\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope (M+2) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M:M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule.\n*   **Careful Point:** All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 2-chlorobenzoic acid) have the same molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight consistent with the MS data. Therefore, the MS data confirms the presence of chlorine but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a classic and unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Eliminated:** A) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride/ester) and B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde/phenol).\n    *   **Remaining:** C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The key information is the splitting pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This symmetrical pattern is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent.\n*   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern allows us to distinguish between the remaining isomers.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It lacks the necessary symmetry and would show a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals for its four aromatic protons.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). This structure has the exact symmetry required to produce two doublets, each for two protons, in the aromatic region.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectra, the identity of the compound is clear. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with a molecular weight of 156. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm it is a carboxylic acid. The aromatic NMR pattern proves it is a para-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct structure from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using its most abundant isotopes.\n*   The peak at m/z = 158 is the M+2 peak. Its intensity is 32% relative to the M⁺ peak.\n*   **Careful Point:** The M⁺ to M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes.\n*   All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a nominal mass of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope). Therefore, the MS data confirms the presence of one chlorine atom but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   The very broad peak observed from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic feature.\n*   **Careful Point:** This extreme broadness is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. It is significantly broader than a typical alcohol O-H peak.\n*   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region and is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   The combination of these two peaks is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **C) Phenyl chloroformate** (which has no O-H group) and option **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid).\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   The singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) is in the characteristic chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   The signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H) are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The splitting pattern is the most decisive piece of information. The presence of only two signals in the aromatic region, both of which are doublets and each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This symmetrical pattern occurs because the molecule has an axis of symmetry, making the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent.\n*   This NMR pattern rules out **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**. As an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring, it is unsymmetrical and would show four unique and more complex signals for its four aromatic protons.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n*   MS confirms a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, shows a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nOnly one option fits all the data: **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**. It is a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom in the para position, which perfectly explains the molecular weight, the IR spectrum, and the symmetrical ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotope of chlorine (³⁵Cl).\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a definitive feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region and is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a carboxylic acid functional group is strongly indicated. This eliminates option **A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde)**, which is an aldehyde/phenol, and option **C (Phenyl chloroformate)**, which is a chloroformate and lacks an O-H group. We are left with the two isomers: 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This is the most crucial piece of data for determining the final structure. The aromatic region shows only two signals, both of which are doublets, and each represents two protons. This highly symmetrical pattern is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The substitution pattern on the benzene ring is para.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It is unsymmetrical and would show a more complex pattern with four distinct signals for its four aromatic protons. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). It possesses the necessary symmetry to produce two doublets in the aromatic region, perfectly matching the observed data.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically applying the information from each spectrum, we can confidently identify the compound.\n*   MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, eliminating options A and C.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the para-substitution pattern of the aromatic ring, eliminating option B.\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and another peak (M+2) at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation:** The ratio of the M⁺ to M+2 peak intensities is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes). The molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope (³⁵Cl) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Careful Point:** All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which corresponds to a nominal mass of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope). Therefore, the mass spectrum confirms the molecular formula but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation:** There is a very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, and its frequency is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** This combination of peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Eliminated:** Phenyl chloroformate (C) is an acid chloride/ester and lacks the O-H group. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D) is an aldehyde and a phenol; its O-H peak would be less broad, and its other spectral features would differ.\n    *   **Remaining:** 2-chlorobenzoic acid (A) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B) are both carboxylic acids and remain as possibilities.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows three signals: 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm (1H)** is in the characteristic chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The key information is the splitting pattern: **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**. This highly symmetrical pattern is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para isomer results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n*   **Careful Point:** This NMR pattern allows us to distinguish between the two remaining isomers.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (A)** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It is unsymmetrical, and its four aromatic protons are all chemically unique. This would produce a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (B)** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). This structure has the necessary symmetry to produce the observed pattern of two doublets for its four aromatic protons.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBy combining the evidence:\n*   MS confirms the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group, eliminating options C and D.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, eliminating option A.\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. According to the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including careful points to consider when interpreting the spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with 32% intensity.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The M+ peak at 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotope of each element (in this case, ³⁵Cl).\n    *   The M+2 peak at m/z 158 has an intensity of about one-third (32%) that of the M+ peak.\n*   **Careful Point:** This M:M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which is consistent with this data, so MS alone does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Data:** A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic and unmistakable signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid**. The broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its frequency is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate option **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (an aldehyde/phenol) and **C) Phenyl chloroformate** (a chloroformate), as neither is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Data:** 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the highly deshielded region (10-13 ppm) characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The splitting pattern is the most crucial piece of information here. The presence of only two signals in the aromatic region, both of which are doublets integrating to two protons each, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This high degree of symmetry means there are only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   This pattern definitively rules out **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**, which is *ortho*-substituted. An ortho-substituted ring has four chemically distinct protons and would produce a much more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   The pattern perfectly matches **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, which is *para*-substituted.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy synthesizing the data:\n*   MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and, most importantly, establishes the 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nOnly one option, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, is consistent with all three pieces of spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes. The M+2 peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity approximately one-third that of the M⁺ peak (a 100:32 or ~3:1 ratio), is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Careful Point:** This data confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW ≈ 156.5 g/mol) and that one chlorine atom is present. All four options are consistent with this information, so the MS data alone cannot distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive feature of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, and its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is crucial. While other functional groups have O-H or C=O bonds, only a carboxylic acid produces this exact combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch in this region. This evidence allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Eliminates B) Phenyl chloroformate:** It lacks an O-H group.\n    *   **Eliminates D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** It is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The symmetry of the molecule is the key to interpreting this pattern. A para-substituted ring has an axis of symmetry that makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. This results in a simple spectrum of two doublets.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is para-substituted and perfectly matches this pattern.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is ortho-substituted. It lacks this symmetry, and its four aromatic protons would all be in unique chemical environments, leading to a much more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets. This option is therefore eliminated.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nBy combining the evidence:\n*   MS confirms the presence of one chlorine atom and the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure that fits all the spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data**\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation:** The M⁺ peak indicates the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes is 156 g/mol. The M+2 peak's intensity relative to the M⁺ peak (100:32, or approximately 3:1) is a characteristic isotopic signature.\n*   **Careful Point:** This 3:1 ratio is definitive proof that the molecule contains **one chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight consistent with this data, so this step confirms the presence of chlorine but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n*   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic and unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, and its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two peaks is conclusive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Eliminated:** Phenyl chloroformate (D) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (A).\n    *   **Remaining:** 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C).\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**\n*   **Data:** A singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic region (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, further confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The pattern is two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n*   **Careful Point:** This highly symmetrical pattern is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other into two doublets. This specific pattern allows for a definitive choice between the remaining options.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (B)** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It lacks symmetry and would show a more complex pattern with four unique signals for its four aromatic protons. It is therefore incorrect.\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (C)** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). Its structure perfectly matches the observed symmetrical two-doublet pattern.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectroscopic techniques, the identity of the unknown compound is unambiguously determined. The mass spectrum confirms a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom. The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. Finally, the ¹H NMR spectrum's specific splitting pattern proves a para (1,4) substitution on the benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n### **Analysis of the Spectral Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n    *   **Observation:** A molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak intensities is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This specific 3:1 isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule. The peak at 156 corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁵Cl isotope, and the peak at 158 corresponds to the molecule with the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the most abundant isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n    *   **Observation:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The combination of these two signals is highly characteristic of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is the O-H stretch, which is extremely broad due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. While other functional groups have O-H or C=O bonds, this specific combination is a classic fingerprint for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This evidence eliminates options that are not carboxylic acids.\n        *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol) is eliminated.\n        *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (a chloroformate ester) is eliminated.\n        *   This leaves the two isomers: B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**\n    *   **Observation 1:** A singlet at 11.0 ppm with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Interpretation:** A signal this far downfield (10-13 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Observation 2:** Two doublets in the aromatic region at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H).\n    *   **Interpretation:** The total integration (2H + 2H) shows four protons on the benzene ring, meaning it is disubstituted.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The splitting pattern is the most decisive piece of information. A pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-isomer makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other into doublets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This NMR pattern is only consistent with a para-substituted structure.\n        *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It lacks symmetry and would show a more complex pattern with four unique signals for its four aromatic protons. It is therefore eliminated.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). It perfectly matches the observed symmetrical two-doublet pattern.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the spectral evidence, the structure can be unambiguously identified. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with a mass of 156. The IR and the NMR singlet at 11.0 ppm confirm it is a carboxylic acid. Finally, the aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR proves it is a para-substituted benzene ring. The only option that satisfies all these criteria is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data, the correct structure can be determined by applying a series of constraints.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Constraint:** The M⁺/M+2 intensity ratio of 100:32 (approximately 3:1) is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The molecular weight of all four candidates (C₇H₅ClO₂) is ~156.5 g/mol, consistent with this data. This constraint confirms the presence of chlorine but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n*   **Result:** All four candidates pass this constraint.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Constraint:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch (due to hydrogen bonding) and a C=O stretch in these positions is the classic signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Phenyl chloroformate (A) is an ester/acid chloride and lacks the O-H group. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (B) is an aldehyde/phenol; while it has an O-H group, it is not a carboxylic acid and would not typically exhibit such an extremely broad O-H peak overlapping the C-H region.\n*   **Result:** This constraint eliminates Phenyl chloroformate (A) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (B). The remaining candidates are 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (D).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) and two doublets in the aromatic region at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   **Constraint 1 (Functional Group):** The singlet at 11.0 ppm is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Substitution Pattern):** The aromatic region is the deciding factor. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a symmetrical **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:**\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (D)** is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) isomer. Its symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons, producing the observed two-doublet pattern.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (C)** is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) isomer. It is unsymmetrical, meaning all four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments. This would produce a much more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets.\n*   **Result:** This constraint eliminates 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C).\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nOnly one candidate, **4-chlorobenzoic acid**, satisfies all the constraints imposed by the MS, IR, and ¹H NMR data. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating careful points for interpreting the spectral data.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with 32% relative intensity.\n*   **Analysis:** The M⁺ peak indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes is 156 u. The M+2 peak's intensity (32% of M⁺, or a ~3:1 ratio) is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This data confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW with ³⁵Cl is 156 u). All four options are isomers with this formula, so MS alone is not sufficient to distinguish them.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Analysis:** The combination of these two signals is highly characteristic of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n    *   The extremely broad peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹) is the O-H stretch, broadened by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The extreme broadness of the O-H peak is a key feature that distinguishes a carboxylic acid from a phenol or alcohol, which typically have less broad O-H peaks. This evidence strongly eliminates Phenyl chloroformate (A) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C), leaving the two benzoic acid isomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Data:** 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm (1H)** is in the classic chemical shift range for a **carboxylic acid proton**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The aromatic region shows a total of four protons (2H + 2H), confirming a disubstituted benzene ring. The pattern of **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**, is a classic fingerprint for a symmetrical **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This NMR pattern is the decisive piece of evidence. A 1,2- (ortho) substituted ring, like 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B), would have four chemically unique aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex spectrum (four separate signals), not two simple doublets.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Conclude**\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Eliminated by IR and NMR (not a carboxylic acid).\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Eliminated by ¹H NMR.

It is a carboxylic acid containing one chlorine atom, and its *para*-substitution pattern perfectly explains the symmetrical ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe combined spectral evidence unambiguously identifies the compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n### **Analysis of the Spectral Data**\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion (M+) peak at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with 32% the intensity of the M+ peak.\n*   **Analysis:** The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak intensities is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point:** This ~3:1 isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%) isotopes. The peak at m/z 156 corresponds to the molecule with ³⁵Cl.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the main isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a corresponding molecular weight, so this step confirms the formula but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n*   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, with the frequency being typical for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows for the elimination of options that do not contain this group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates:\n    *   B) Phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride with no O-H group).\n    *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol; it lacks a carboxylic acid).\n    We are now left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**\n*   **Data:** 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic region (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. There are a total of four aromatic protons (2H + 2H).\n*   **Careful Point:** The splitting pattern is the most decisive piece of information. The presence of only **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-isomer results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, which split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The substitution pattern on the benzene ring is para. This allows us to distinguish between the final two options:\n    *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *ortho* (1,2) substituted. It is unsymmetrical and would show a more complex pattern with four unique signals for its four aromatic protons. This is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *para* (1,4) substituted. This structure has the necessary symmetry to produce two doublets for its four aromatic protons. This is a perfect match for the data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically applying the constraints from each piece of spectral data, we can confidently identify the unknown compound. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with a mass of 156. The IR confirms it is a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR confirms the para-substitution pattern.

The peak at 156 corresponds to the molecule containing the more abundant ³⁵Cl isotope.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the main isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data, so this step confirms the formula but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:** The combination of these two signals is highly characteristic of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is the O-H stretch, which is extremely broad due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. While other functional groups have O-H or C=O bonds, this specific combination is a classic fingerprint for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** This evidence eliminates options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Eliminated:** C) Phenyl chloroformate (a chloroformate ester with no O-H group) and D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Remaining:** A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm (1H)** is in the characteristic chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The total integration (2H + 2H) shows four protons on the benzene ring, meaning it is disubstituted.\n*   **Careful Point:** The splitting pattern is the most decisive piece of information. A pattern of **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**, is the classic signature of a symmetrical **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-isomer makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** This NMR pattern is only consistent with a para-substituted structure.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It lacks the necessary symmetry and would show a more complex pattern with four unique signals for its four aromatic protons. It is therefore eliminated.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). It perfectly matches the observed symmetrical two-doublet pattern.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the spectral evidence, the structure can be unambiguously identified. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with a mass of 156. The IR and the NMR singlet at 11.0 ppm confirm it is a carboxylic acid. Finally, the aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR proves it is a para-substituted benzene ring. The only option that satisfies all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The M+2 peak's intensity (32% of M⁺, a ratio of approximately 3:1) is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This data confirms the molecular formula for all four options (C₇H₅ClO₂) is correct, as they all have a molecular weight of ~156.5 g/mol. The MS data alone does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The combination of these two signals is a classic fingerprint for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extremely broad peak is the O-H stretch, broadened by strong hydrogen bonding. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This information allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n        *   **Eliminate B) Phenyl chloroformate:** It lacks an O-H group.\n        *   **Eliminate A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** It is an aldehyde and a phenol. While it has O-H and C=O groups, the IR signature of a carboxylic acid (the extremely broad O-H stretch) is unique and matches the data perfectly. The ¹H NMR will later confirm this elimination.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is either 2-chlorobenzoic acid or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Data:** A singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n    *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm** is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   The signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm) are the key to determining the substitution pattern. There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H). The pattern of **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para isomer results in only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This NMR splitting pattern is the deciding factor.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It is unsymmetrical and would have four chemically distinct aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex spectrum (four separate signals), not two simple doublets.\n        *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). Its symmetry perfectly matches the observed NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the data, we can definitively identify the compound. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with the correct molecular weight. The IR and the NMR peak at 11.0 ppm confirm it is a carboxylic acid. The aromatic pattern in the NMR spectrum proves it has a 1,4-(para) substitution pattern. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Careful Point:** All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a nominal mass of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope). Therefore, the mass spectrum confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a definitive feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its frequency is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (an aldehyde/phenol) and **C) Phenyl chloroformate** (a chloroformate ester with no O-H group). This leaves the two isomers, 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid, as the only possibilities.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The crucial information is the splitting pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n*   **Careful Point:** This highly symmetrical pattern is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The molecule has an axis of symmetry, which makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other into doublets.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a para-substituted molecule and perfectly matches this NMR pattern.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is an ortho-substituted molecule. It lacks this symmetry, and its four aromatic protons are all chemically distinct. This would result in a more complex spectrum with four separate signals, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe mass spectrum confirms a molecular formula of C₇H₅ClO₂. The IR and NMR data confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The ¹H NMR splitting pattern specifically proves that the substituents on the benzene ring are in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and another peak (M+2) at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak.\n*   **Interpretation:** The M⁺ to M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecule with the ³⁵Cl isotope, and the peak at m/z = 158 corresponds to the molecule with the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n*   **Careful Point:** This data confirms the molecular weight (156 g/mol for the most abundant isotope) and the presence of one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this finding, so this step alone is not sufficient to distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum displays a very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, with its specific frequency being consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is powerful evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that do not contain this group.\n    *   **Eliminated:** Phenyl chloroformate (C) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D).\n    *   **Remaining:** 4-chlorobenzoic acid (A) and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B).\n\n### **3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows three signals: a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm (1H)** is in the characteristic chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The key information is the splitting pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H).\n*   **Careful Point:** This symmetrical pattern is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other into two doublets.\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (A)** is para-substituted and would produce this exact pattern.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (B)** is ortho-substituted. It lacks the necessary symmetry, and its four aromatic protons are all in unique chemical environments. This would result in a more complex spectrum with four separate signals, not two simple doublets.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nBy combining the evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques:\n1.  **MS** confirms the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n2.  **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, eliminating options C and D.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the para-substitution pattern of the aromatic ring, eliminating option B.\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope (M+2) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M:M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule.\n*   **Careful Point:** All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 2-chlorobenzoic acid) have the same molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight consistent with the MS data. Therefore, the MS data confirms the presence of chlorine but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a classic and unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Eliminated:** A) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride/ester) and B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde/phenol).\n    *   **Remaining:** C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The key information is the splitting pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This symmetrical pattern is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent.\n*   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern allows us to distinguish between the remaining isomers.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It lacks the necessary symmetry and would show a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals for its four aromatic protons.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). This structure has the exact symmetry required to produce two doublets, each for two protons, in the aromatic region.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectra, the identity of the compound is clear. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with a molecular weight of 156. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm it is a carboxylic acid. The aromatic NMR pattern proves it is a para-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct structure from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using its most abundant isotopes.\n*   The peak at m/z = 158 is the M+2 peak. Its intensity is 32% relative to the M⁺ peak.\n*   **Careful Point:** The M⁺ to M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes.\n*   All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a nominal mass of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope). Therefore, the MS data confirms the presence of one chlorine atom but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   The very broad peak observed from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic feature.\n*   **Careful Point:** This extreme broadness is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. It is significantly broader than a typical alcohol O-H peak.\n*   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region and is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   The combination of these two peaks is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **C) Phenyl chloroformate** (which has no O-H group) and option **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid).\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   The singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) is in the characteristic chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   The signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H) are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The splitting pattern is the most decisive piece of information. The presence of only two signals in the aromatic region, both of which are doublets and each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This symmetrical pattern occurs because the molecule has an axis of symmetry, making the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent.\n*   This NMR pattern rules out **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**. As an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring, it is unsymmetrical and would show four unique and more complex signals for its four aromatic protons.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n*   MS confirms a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, shows a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nOnly one option fits all the data: **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**. It is a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom in the para position, which perfectly explains the molecular weight, the IR spectrum, and the symmetrical ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotope of chlorine (³⁵Cl).\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a definitive feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region and is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a carboxylic acid functional group is strongly indicated. This eliminates option **A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde)**, which is an aldehyde/phenol, and option **C (Phenyl chloroformate)**, which is a chloroformate and lacks an O-H group. We are left with the two isomers: 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This is the most crucial piece of data for determining the final structure. The aromatic region shows only two signals, both of which are doublets, and each represents two protons. This highly symmetrical pattern is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The substitution pattern on the benzene ring is para.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It is unsymmetrical and would show a more complex pattern with four distinct signals for its four aromatic protons. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). It possesses the necessary symmetry to produce two doublets in the aromatic region, perfectly matching the observed data.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically applying the information from each spectrum, we can confidently identify the compound.\n*   MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, eliminating options A and C.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the para-substitution pattern of the aromatic ring, eliminating option B.\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and another peak (M+2) at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation:** The ratio of the M⁺ to M+2 peak intensities is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes). The molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope (³⁵Cl) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Careful Point:** All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which corresponds to a nominal mass of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope). Therefore, the mass spectrum confirms the molecular formula but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation:** There is a very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, and its frequency is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** This combination of peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Eliminated:** Phenyl chloroformate (C) is an acid chloride/ester and lacks the O-H group. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D) is an aldehyde and a phenol; its O-H peak would be less broad, and its other spectral features would differ.\n    *   **Remaining:** 2-chlorobenzoic acid (A) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B) are both carboxylic acids and remain as possibilities.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows three signals: 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm (1H)** is in the characteristic chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The key information is the splitting pattern: **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**. This highly symmetrical pattern is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para isomer results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n*   **Careful Point:** This NMR pattern allows us to distinguish between the two remaining isomers.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (A)** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It is unsymmetrical, and its four aromatic protons are all chemically unique. This would produce a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (B)** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). This structure has the necessary symmetry to produce the observed pattern of two doublets for its four aromatic protons.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBy combining the evidence:\n*   MS confirms the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group, eliminating options C and D.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, eliminating option A.\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. According to the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including careful points to consider when interpreting the spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with 32% intensity.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The M+ peak at 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotope of each element (in this case, ³⁵Cl).\n    *   The M+2 peak at m/z 158 has an intensity of about one-third (32%) that of the M+ peak.\n*   **Careful Point:** This M:M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which is consistent with this data, so MS alone does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Data:** A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic and unmistakable signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid**. The broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its frequency is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate option **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (an aldehyde/phenol) and **C) Phenyl chloroformate** (a chloroformate), as neither is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Data:** 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the highly deshielded region (10-13 ppm) characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The splitting pattern is the most crucial piece of information here. The presence of only two signals in the aromatic region, both of which are doublets integrating to two protons each, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This high degree of symmetry means there are only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   This pattern definitively rules out **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**, which is *ortho*-substituted. An ortho-substituted ring has four chemically distinct protons and would produce a much more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   The pattern perfectly matches **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, which is *para*-substituted.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy synthesizing the data:\n*   MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and, most importantly, establishes the 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nOnly one option, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, is consistent with all three pieces of spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes. The M+2 peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity approximately one-third that of the M⁺ peak (a 100:32 or ~3:1 ratio), is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Careful Point:** This data confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW ≈ 156.5 g/mol) and that one chlorine atom is present. All four options are consistent with this information, so the MS data alone cannot distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive feature of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, and its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is crucial. While other functional groups have O-H or C=O bonds, only a carboxylic acid produces this exact combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch in this region. This evidence allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Eliminates B) Phenyl chloroformate:** It lacks an O-H group.\n    *   **Eliminates D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** It is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The symmetry of the molecule is the key to interpreting this pattern. A para-substituted ring has an axis of symmetry that makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. This results in a simple spectrum of two doublets.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is para-substituted and perfectly matches this pattern.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is ortho-substituted. It lacks this symmetry, and its four aromatic protons would all be in unique chemical environments, leading to a much more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets. This option is therefore eliminated.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nBy combining the evidence:\n*   MS confirms the presence of one chlorine atom and the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure that fits all the spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data**\n\n**1.

The M+2 peak's intensity relative to the M⁺ peak (100:32, or approximately 3:1) is a characteristic isotopic signature.\n*   **Careful Point:** This 3:1 ratio is definitive proof that the molecule contains **one chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight consistent with this data, so this step confirms the presence of chlorine but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2.

This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Eliminated:** Phenyl chloroformate (D) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (A).\n    *   **Remaining:** 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C).\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**\n*   **Data:** A singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic region (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, further confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The pattern is two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n*   **Careful Point:** This highly symmetrical pattern is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other into two doublets. This specific pattern allows for a definitive choice between the remaining options.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (B)** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It lacks symmetry and would show a more complex pattern with four unique signals for its four aromatic protons. It is therefore incorrect.\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (C)** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). Its structure perfectly matches the observed symmetrical two-doublet pattern.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectroscopic techniques, the identity of the unknown compound is unambiguously determined. The mass spectrum confirms a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom. The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.

The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. While other functional groups have O-H or C=O bonds, this specific combination is a classic fingerprint for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This evidence eliminates options that are not carboxylic acids.\n        *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol) is eliminated.\n        *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (a chloroformate ester) is eliminated.\n        *   This leaves the two isomers: B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**\n    *   **Observation 1:** A singlet at 11.0 ppm with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Interpretation:** A signal this far downfield (10-13 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Observation 2:** Two doublets in the aromatic region at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H).\n    *   **Interpretation:** The total integration (2H + 2H) shows four protons on the benzene ring, meaning it is disubstituted.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The splitting pattern is the most decisive piece of information. A pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-isomer makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent.

The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with a mass of 156. The IR and the NMR singlet at 11.0 ppm confirm it is a carboxylic acid. Finally, the aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR proves it is a para-substituted benzene ring. The only option that satisfies all these criteria is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data, the correct structure can be determined by applying a series of constraints.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Constraint:** The M⁺/M+2 intensity ratio of 100:32 (approximately 3:1) is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The molecular weight of all four candidates (C₇H₅ClO₂) is ~156.5 g/mol, consistent with this data. This constraint confirms the presence of chlorine but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n*   **Result:** All four candidates pass this constraint.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Constraint:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch (due to hydrogen bonding) and a C=O stretch in these positions is the classic signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Phenyl chloroformate (A) is an ester/acid chloride and lacks the O-H group. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (B) is an aldehyde/phenol; while it has an O-H group, it is not a carboxylic acid and would not typically exhibit such an extremely broad O-H peak overlapping the C-H region.\n*   **Result:** This constraint eliminates Phenyl chloroformate (A) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (B). The remaining candidates are 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (D).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) and two doublets in the aromatic region at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   **Constraint 1 (Functional Group):** The singlet at 11.0 ppm is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Substitution Pattern):** The aromatic region is the deciding factor. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a symmetrical **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:**\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (D)** is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) isomer. Its symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons, producing the observed two-doublet pattern.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (C)** is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) isomer. It is unsymmetrical, meaning all four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments. This would produce a much more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets.\n*   **Result:** This constraint eliminates 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C).\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nOnly one candidate, **4-chlorobenzoic acid**, satisfies all the constraints imposed by the MS, IR, and ¹H NMR data. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating careful points for interpreting the spectral data.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with 32% relative intensity.\n*   **Analysis:** The M⁺ peak indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes is 156 u. The M+2 peak's intensity (32% of M⁺, or a ~3:1 ratio) is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This data confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW with ³⁵Cl is 156 u). All four options are isomers with this formula, so MS alone is not sufficient to distinguish them.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Analysis:** The combination of these two signals is highly characteristic of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n    *   The extremely broad peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹) is the O-H stretch, broadened by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The extreme broadness of the O-H peak is a key feature that distinguishes a carboxylic acid from a phenol or alcohol, which typically have less broad O-H peaks. This evidence strongly eliminates Phenyl chloroformate (A) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C), leaving the two benzoic acid isomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Data:** 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm (1H)** is in the classic chemical shift range for a **carboxylic acid proton**, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The aromatic region shows a total of four protons (2H + 2H), confirming a disubstituted benzene ring. The pattern of **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**, is a classic fingerprint for a symmetrical **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This NMR pattern is the decisive piece of evidence. A 1,2- (ortho) substituted ring, like 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B), would have four chemically unique aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex spectrum (four separate signals), not two simple doublets.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Conclude**\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Eliminated by IR and NMR (not a carboxylic acid).\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Eliminated by ¹H NMR. It is an *ortho*-substituted isomer and would not produce the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Eliminated by IR and NMR (not a carboxylic acid).\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a perfect match for all the data. It is a carboxylic acid containing one chlorine atom, and its *para*-substitution pattern perfectly explains the symmetrical ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe combined spectral evidence unambiguously identifies the compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n### **Analysis of the Spectral Data**\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion (M+) peak at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with 32% the intensity of the M+ peak.\n*   **Analysis:** The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak intensities is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point:** This ~3:1 isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%) isotopes. The peak at m/z 156 corresponds to the molecule with ³⁵Cl.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the main isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a corresponding molecular weight, so this step confirms the formula but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n*   **Data:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, with the frequency being typical for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows for the elimination of options that do not contain this group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates:\n    *   B) Phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride with no O-H group).\n    *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol; it lacks a carboxylic acid).\n    We are now left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**\n*   **Data:** 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic region (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. There are a total of four aromatic protons (2H + 2H).\n*   **Careful Point:** The splitting pattern is the most decisive piece of information. The presence of only **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-isomer results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, which split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The substitution pattern on the benzene ring is para. This allows us to distinguish between the final two options:\n    *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *ortho* (1,2) substituted. It is unsymmetrical and would show a more complex pattern with four unique signals for its four aromatic protons. This is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *para* (1,4) substituted. This structure has the necessary symmetry to produce two doublets for its four aromatic protons. This is a perfect match for the data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically applying the constraints from each piece of spectral data, we can confidently identify the unknown compound. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with a mass of 156. The IR confirms it is a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR confirms the para-substitution pattern. Only one option fits all criteria.\n\nThe correct structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
