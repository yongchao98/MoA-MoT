    # Constraint 1: Carbon Count
    # Starting material (3,4-dimethylhexanedial) has 6 (hexane) + 2 (dimethyl) = 8 carbons.
    # Reagent 2 (CH3CH2MgBr) adds an ethyl group, which has 2 carbons.
    # The final product must have 8 + 2 = 10 carbons.

    # Constraint 2: Final Functional Group

    # This process cleaves a C=C double bond. A carbon from the double bond that is attached
    # to a hydrogen atom (=C-H) is oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH).
    # Therefore, the final product must be a carboxylic acid, which has the IUPAC suffix "-oic acid".
    # It cannot be an aldehyde ("-al").
