Based on an analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a strong consensus on the underlying scientific principles, even though the final letter choices vary. The correct answer can be determined by a careful, step-by-step analysis of the chemistry and chromatography involved.

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

1.  **Analyze the Chemical Reactions:** The core of the problem is to identify the products of two separate reactions. The reaction sequence (mCPBA followed by aqueous acid) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.
    *   **Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation. The stereochemical rule is that anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a **meso compound**. Therefore, this reaction produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.
    *   **Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) undergoes the same anti-dihydroxylation. The rule here is that anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. This reaction produces two compounds in a 1:1 ratio: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.

2.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture:** The chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:
    *   Product 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol
    *   Product 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol
    *   Product 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol
    The relationship between these is that the meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the other two, while the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.

3.  **Predict the Chromatographic Results:**
    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.
        *   The meso-diol (a diastereomer) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.
        *   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will co-elute as a single peak.
        *   **Result: 2 peaks.**
    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase and can separate all stereoisomers.
        *   It will separate the meso-diol from the other two compounds (as a diastereomer).
        *   It will also resolve the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers from each other.
        *   **Result: 3 peaks.**

### **Careful Points and Conclusion**

*   **Reaction Stereochemistry:** The key is to correctly identify the reaction as an *anti*-dihydroxylation and apply the rules: Trans + Anti → Meso, and Cis + Anti → Racemic.
*   **Chromatography Principles:** It is essential to distinguish between the capabilities of achiral and chiral HPLC. Achiral separates diastereomers only; chiral separates both diastereomers and enantiomers.
*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** Nearly all candidate answers correctly deduce the scientific outcome: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC. The discrepancies arise from incorrectly matching this conclusion to the multiple-choice letters.
*   **Final Decision:** The correct conclusion is **2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC**. This corresponds directly to option B.
