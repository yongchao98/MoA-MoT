    Based on the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

    ### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Question
    The question asks to identify the physical theory that "never requires regularization at high energies." This is a technical concept in theoretical physics.
    *   **High Energies & Divergences:** In quantum field theories, calculations for interactions at very high energies (or, equivalently, at infinitesimally short distances) often result in infinite values. These are called "ultraviolet (UV) divergences."
    *   **Regularization:** This is a set of mathematical techniques used to temporarily manage these infinities, typically by introducing an artificial limit or "cutoff." It is a necessary step in making theories like Quantum Electrodynamics predictive.
    *   **The Goal:** The question seeks the theory that is fundamentally constructed to be free of these UV divergences, making the ad-hoc procedure of regularization unnecessary.

    ### Step 2: Analyze the Consensus Reasoning for Each Option
    There is a remarkable and unanimous consensus in the *physical reasoning* provided by all candidate answers, even those that ultimately select the wrong letter.

    *   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** All agents who analyze this option correctly note that it has its own divergence problem. The self-energy of a point-like charged particle is infinite, indicating a breakdown of the theory at short distances that requires a form of regularization to resolve. Therefore, it **requires** regularization.

    *   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) & C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** All agents correctly identify these as the textbook examples of quantum field theories that are plagued by UV divergences in their calculations (specifically in "loop diagrams"). They are fundamentally reliant on the procedures of regularization and renormalization to make finite, physical predictions. Therefore, they both **require** regularization.

    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** All agents correctly identify that a primary motivation and celebrated feature of Superstring Theory is that it is believed to be "UV-finite." By postulating that fundamental particles are extended one-dimensional strings rather than zero-dimensional points, the theory "smears out" interactions. This smearing naturally smooths over the short-distance behavior that causes infinities in the other theories. Therefore, it **does not require** regularization for high-energy divergences.

    ### Step 3: Identify and Resolve Inconsistencies
    The primary issue with the candidate answers is not the physics reasoning, but frequent clerical errors.
    *   **Inconsistency:** Many agents (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) provide a perfect explanation for why Superstring Theory is the correct answer, but then output a final letter (`<<<...>>>`) that corresponds to a different option. This is likely due to the agents internally re-lettering the options during their analysis and failing to map their conclusion back to the original question's lettering.
    *   **Resolution:** The physical reasoning is the reliable part of the analysis. The consensus on the physics is unambiguous: Superstring Theory is the only option that fits the criteria.

    ### Step 4: Final Conclusion
    The unanimous physical reasoning across all candidate answers points to a single conclusion. Classical Electrodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Quantum Chromodynamics all suffer from high-energy/short-distance divergences that necessitate regularization. Superstring Theory is the only option listed that is constructed to be inherently free from these ultraviolet divergences.

    Mapping this correct theory back to the original question's options:
    A) Classical Electrodynamics
    B) Quantum Electrodynamics
    C) Quantum Chromodynamics
    D) Superstring Theory

    The correct option is D.
