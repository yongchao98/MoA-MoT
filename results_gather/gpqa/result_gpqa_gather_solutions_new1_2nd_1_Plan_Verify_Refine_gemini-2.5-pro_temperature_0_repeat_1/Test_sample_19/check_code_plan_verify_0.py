Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Concept: The "Impulse" Approximation

The question asks for the set of assumptions that jointly define the "impulse approximation." The central idea of this approximation is to simplify a very complex problem—a probe interacting with a nucleus containing many bound nucleons—by treating it as a much simpler event. The name "impulse" suggests a very rapid, high-energy interaction. In this scenario, the probe delivers a sharp "kick" or "impulse" to a single nucleon, and this interaction happens so quickly that the nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle, momentarily isolated from the rest of the nucleus.

### Step 2: Analyze Each Assumption Individually

Let's evaluate each of the four statements to see if it is a necessary component of this "free nucleon" picture.

*   **Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**
    *   **Analysis:** This is the foundational assumption. It allows physicists to treat the total interaction as an incoherent sum of individual interactions with each nucleon. It explicitly ignores more complex scenarios where the probe might interact with a pair of nucleons or the virtual particles (mesons) being exchanged between them (these are called many-body currents). To treat the interaction as a single-nucleon event, one must first assume it *is* a single-nucleon event.
    *   **Verdict:** This assumption is **essential**.

*   **Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**
    *   **Analysis:** This assumption addresses the environment of the collision. For the struck nucleon to truly behave as if it were "free," it must be isolated from the influence of the other nucleons. This assumption states that neither the incoming probe nor the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) have any secondary collisions with the other nucleons. This is known as neglecting initial-state and final-state interactions (ISI and FSI).
    *   **Verdict:** This assumption is **essential** to achieve the idealized "free nucleon" picture.

*   **Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**
    *   **Analysis:** This statement concerns the internal physics of the nucleon itself, not its behavior within the nucleus. The impulse approximation operates at the level of nucleons, treating them as the fundamental particles of the interaction. The properties of the nucleon (like its form factors) are indeed determined by its quark-gluon structure, but the impulse approximation itself can be applied whether the model for the nucleon's interior is relativistic or not. This is a separate physical consideration.
    *   **Verdict:** This assumption is **not essential** and acts as a distractor.

*   **Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**
    *   **Analysis:** This is the very essence of the "impulse" concept. It is a "sudden approximation" that assumes the interaction happens so fast that the relatively slow-acting nuclear forces that bind the nucleon don't have time to act. During the brief moment of the collision, the nucleon's binding energy is considered negligible compared to the energy transferred. This is what allows the nucleon to be treated as a "free" particle at the point of interaction.
    *   **Verdict:** This assumption is **essential**.

### Step 3: Synthesize the Findings and Identify Careful Points

*   **Core Logic:** The analysis consistently shows that assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are the three pillars that jointly create the simplified "impulse approximation" picture. Assumption 3 is about a different level of physics and is irrelevant.
*   **Correct Combination:** The required set of assumptions is {1, 2, 4}.
*   **Mapping to Options:** We must match the set {1, 2, 4} to the given choices:
    *   A) 1, 3, 4
    *   B) 2, 3, 4
    *   C) 1, 2, 4
    *   D) 1, 2, 3
    The correct option is **C**.
*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** A review of the provided candidate answers reveals a crucial pattern. The overwhelming majority of the answers correctly identify {1, 2, 4} as the required set of assumptions in their *reasoning*. However, many of them then make a simple clerical error, matching this correct set to the wrong letter option (e.g., claiming {1, 2, 4} corresponds to D). The consensus of the *physical reasoning* is extremely strong and points directly to the combination of assumptions 1, 2, and 4.

### Final Conclusion

The three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:
1.  The interaction is with a single nucleon.
2.  The rest of the nucleus is transparent to the interacting particles.
4.  The nucleon's binding forces are negligible during the interaction.

This set of assumptions corresponds to option C.
