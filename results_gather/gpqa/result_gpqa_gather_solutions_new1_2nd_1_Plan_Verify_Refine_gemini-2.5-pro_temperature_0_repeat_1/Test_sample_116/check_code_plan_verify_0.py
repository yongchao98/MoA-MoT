    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers and chemical principles.

    **1. Understand the Core Concept: Optical Isomerism**
    The fundamental question is about identifying which molecules exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule shows optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most reliable way to determine chirality is to check for the absence of key symmetry elements, specifically a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i). The presence of either of these elements makes a molecule achiral and thus not optically active.

    **2. Analyze Each Compound**

    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
        *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system where two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.
        *   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** The key feature is the presence of large, bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho*-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). These groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond.
        *   **Conclusion:** This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. The reasoning across all candidate answers is unanimous on this point.

    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
        *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.
        *   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** We must check for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:
            1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)
            2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)
            3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)
            4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)
        *   **Conclusion:** Since the four attached groups are distinct, the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism. The reasoning across all candidate answers is also unanimous on this point.

    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**
        *   **Structure:** (C₆H₅)₂C=O.
        *   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** We must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the central carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.
        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, benzophenone is not optically active. All candidate answers agree.

    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**
        *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the astructure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.
        *   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.
        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral and therefore not optically active. All candidate answers agree.

    **3. Final Decision**
    The analysis consistently shows:
    *   Compound 1 is **optically active**.
    *   Compound 2 is **optically active**.
    *   Compound 3 is **not optically active**.
    *   Compound 4 is **not optically active**.

    The set of compounds that show optical isomerism is {1, 2}. Matching this to the provided options:
    A) 2 and 3
    B) 1 and 2
    C) 3 and 4
    D) 1, 2 and 4

    The correct option is B.

    *Note on Candidate Answers*: While the chemical reasoning in nearly all candidate answers is correct (identifying 1 and 2 as active), many of them select the wrong final letter (e.g., C or D). This indicates an error in matching their correct reasoning to the final option letter, not an error in the chemical analysis itself. The consensus of the detailed analysis points unequivocally to compounds 1 and 2.
