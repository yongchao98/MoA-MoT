The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** We must piece together the remaining signals to identify the alkyl substituent.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).

It is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and the methine proton (at 2.9 ppm), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift is due to its benzylic position (attached to the aromatic ring).

The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl substituent are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\nApplying the transformation from Step 2 to the starting material from Step 1:\n\n*   The **-COOH** group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted to a **-CH₃** group.\n*   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 4: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\nNow, we compare our derived product with the list of possible answers.\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - **This matches our derived final product.**\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product. It is a common distractor in multi-step problems.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not its isomer isobutyl. No rearrangement is expected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis of the spectral data correctly identifies the starting material, and knowledge of the specific chemical reaction correctly predicts the final product. The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting material, Compound X.**\n\nThe first task is to use the provided spectroscopic data (IR and ¹H NMR) to determine the chemical structure of Compound X.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, significantly downfield, confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing them to be deshielded. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Group:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is the methylene group (-CH₂-), which is coupled to both the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine group at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift is due to it being benzylic (attached directly to the benzene ring). It is coupled to the adjacent methyl and methylene groups.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** The alkyl fragments combine to form a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The structure is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. The correct name is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option **(D)**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\nThe second task is to identify the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is well-known for the complete reduction of carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkanes (in this case, a methyl group, -CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl substituent are stable under these conditions and remain unchanged.\n*   **Final Product:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is converted to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\nNow, we compare the name of the final product with the provided choices.\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - This matches our deduced final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer. No rearrangement is expected.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nThe final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, taking into account the provided answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first crucial step is to correctly identify the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a definitive characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The IR data points conclusively to an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   The remaining signals define the alkyl substituent:\n        *   The signals for a `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)` group (a **sec-butyl** group) are all present: a methine proton (CH) attached to the ring at 2.9 ppm, a methylene group (CH₂) at 1.7 ppm, a doublet for a methyl group at 1.4 ppm, and a triplet for another methyl group at 0.9 ppm.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** The combined data unambiguously identifies Compound X as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C) in the list. Almost all candidate answers correctly performed this step.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe second step is to understand the chemical transformation that occurs.\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a well-known, powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its specific function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced all the way to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl alkyl group are stable under these conditions and remain unchanged.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**\n\nCombining the findings from the first two steps gives the final product.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group is converted to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product Name:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n### **Step 4: Matching the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nThe final and most important step is to match the identified product with the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **Correct.** This name exactly matches the deduced final product.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect. This is a completely different molecular structure.\n\n**Conclusion on Candidate Answers:**\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly identified the starting material and the final product by name, there were widespread errors in matching the final product's name to the correct letter option. Many incorrectly chose <<<A>>> or <<<C>>>. The correct chemical reasoning, however, consistently leads to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
