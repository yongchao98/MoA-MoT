def check_synchrocyclotron_revolutions():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the calculated number of revolutions for a proton in a synchrocyclotron.

    The function verifies the calculation based on the following physics principles:
    1. Total energy gained is the final kinetic energy (since initial is negligible).
    2. Energy is gained twice per revolution.
    3. The energy gain per acceleration event is modulated by the cosine of the synchronous phase.
    4. The number of revolutions is the total energy divided by the energy per revolution, rounded up to the next integer.
