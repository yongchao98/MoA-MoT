    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, incorporating careful points from the provided candidate answers.

    ### Step 1: Analysis of Part A (Tautomerism)

    The question asks to identify the compound that does not show tautomerism from the pair: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

    *   Careful Point 1: The condition for keto-enol tautomerism. This process requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen). For typical keto-enol tautomerism, this hydrogen must be on a saturated (sp³ hybridized) carbon.

    *   Analysis of Benzoquinone:
        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).
        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have any attached hydrogen atoms.
        *   Conclusion: Benzoquinone lacks the necessary α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon and therefore does not show tautomerism.

    *   Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:
        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyls are -CH₂- groups.
        *   The hydrogens on these -CH₂- groups are α-hydrogens. They are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.
        *   Conclusion: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism. It readily converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is exceptionally stable due to its aromaticity.

    Result for Part A: The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

    ### Step 2: Analysis of Part B (Optical Isomerism)

    The question asks to identify the compound that will show optical isomerism from the pair: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

    *   Careful Point 2: The condition for optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image). The most common indicator of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four *different* groups.

    *   Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:
        *   Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.
        *   The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:
            1.  -H (hydrogen)
            2.  -OH (hydroxyl)
            3.  -CH₃ (methyl)
            4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)
        *   Conclusion: Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will show optical isomerism.

    *   Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:
        *   Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (the *trans* isomer).
        *   The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers.
        *   Conclusion: Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.

    Result for Part B: The compound that will show optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

    ### Step 3: Final Conclusion

    Combining the results from the analysis:
    *   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is benzoquinone.
    *   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

    Now, we must carefully match this conclusion to the given multiple-choice options:
    A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
    B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate
    C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
    D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

    *   Careful Point 3: The mapping error. A review of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical analysis is almost universally correct, many answers make a clerical error by matching their correct conclusion to the wrong lettered option.

    The correct combination, "A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate," corresponds exactly to Option A.

    if not match:

    provided_answer_letter = match.group(1)
