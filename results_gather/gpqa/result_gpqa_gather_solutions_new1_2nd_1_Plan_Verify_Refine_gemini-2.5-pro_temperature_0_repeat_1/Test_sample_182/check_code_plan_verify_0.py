Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)

The starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.

Let's identify each feature contributing to the IHD in the starting material:
*   **One Ring**: The `cyclohex-` part of the name indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.
*   **Four Pi (π) Bonds**:
    1.  One C=C double bond in the ring, indicated by `-3-ene`. This contributes **+1**.
    2.  One C=C double bond in the `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂). This contributes **+1**.
    3.  One C=O double bond in the `formyl` group (-CHO). This contributes **+1**.
    4.  One C=O double bond in the `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH). This contributes **+1**.

The total IHD of the starting material is the sum of these contributions: 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**. This value corresponds to option D, but it is the IHD of the reactant, not the product.

### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction

The reagent used is **red phosphorus (P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a crucial point. This combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its function is to perform exhaustive reduction.

*   **Effect on Functional Groups**: It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkanes (in this case, methyl groups, -CH₃).
*   **Effect on Unsaturation**: It also reduces, or saturates, all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).
*   **Effect on Rings**: The reagent is not strong enough to break stable, saturated carbon rings like cyclohexane.

### Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product

The reaction will reduce all the sites of unsaturation (the four pi bonds) but will leave the carbon ring skeleton intact.

*   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.
*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group.
*   The C=O bonds in the formyl and carboxylic acid groups are removed, and these groups are converted to methyl groups.

The final product is a **saturated, substituted cyclohexane**. It contains a single ring but has no double or triple bonds.

Now, we calculate the IHD for this final product:
*   **Number of rings**: 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).
*   **Number of π bonds**: 0 (all double bonds were reduced to single bonds).

The IHD of the final product is the sum of these values:
IHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.

### Step 4: Conclusion and Final Answer Selection

The analysis consistently shows that the reaction preserves the single ring structure while eliminating all four pi bonds. The resulting molecule, a substituted cyclohexane, has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1.

Looking at the options:
A) 1
B) 0
C) 3
D) 5

The calculated IHD of 1 matches option A. A review of the candidate answers confirms that while the reasoning in almost all of them correctly leads to an IHD of 1, many make a clerical error in selecting the final option letter. The correct chemical reasoning is paramount.
