    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1
    for a system in the state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>.

    The probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:
    P = |<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>|^2

    A fundamental selection rule is that the coefficient is zero unless m = m1 + m2.
