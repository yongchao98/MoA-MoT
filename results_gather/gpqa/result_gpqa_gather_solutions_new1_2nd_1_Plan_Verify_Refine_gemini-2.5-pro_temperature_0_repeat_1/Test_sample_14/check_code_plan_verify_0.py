def check_transit_probability_ratio():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the final answer by recalculating the ratio of transit probabilities.

    The problem states:
    - R_s1 = R_s2 (Stellar radii are equal)
    - M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 (Mass of Star 1 is twice Mass of Star 2)
    - P1 = P2 / 3 (Period of Planet 1 is 1/3 of Period of Planet 2)

    The transit probability 'p' is proportional to R_s / a.
    The ratio p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2).
    Since R_s1 = R_s2, this simplifies to p1 / p2 = a2 / a1.

    From Kepler's Third Law, a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3).
    So, a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / (M_s1 * P1^2) ]^(1/3).

    Substituting the given relationships:
    a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * (3*P1)^2) / ((2*M_s2) * P1^2) ]^(1/3)
    a2 / a1 = [ (9 * M_s2 * P1^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P1^2) ]^(1/3)
    a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)
