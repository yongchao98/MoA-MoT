    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the exoplanet transit probability problem.

    The key steps are:
    1. The ratio of transit probabilities p1/p2 simplifies to a2/a1 because the stellar radii are equal.
    2. From Kepler's Third Law (a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2), the ratio a2/a1 can be derived.
    3. a2/a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / (M_s1 * P1^2) ]^(1/3)
    4. Given M_s1 = 2*M_s2 and P2 = 3*P1, we substitute these into the equation.
    5. The ratio becomes ( (1 * 3^2) / (2 * 1^2) )^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3).
