    # --- Step 1: Identify Substance Z ---
    # Constraint: Z is a hydrocarbon with H mass fraction of 14.28% (~1/7).
    # This corresponds to the general formula CnH2n.
    # Constraint: Z is saturated, so it must be a cycloalkane.
    # Constraint: Z is a widely used solvent.
    # Conclusion: The most logical candidate is cyclohexane (C6H12).

    # --- Step 2: Identify Mixture Y ---
    # Constraint: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one being Z (cyclohexane).
    # Constraint: Y does not decolorize bromine water (components are saturated or aromatic).
    # Constraint: Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.
    # Conclusion: The other component must have a C6 skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane.
    # Since it's not saturated (it's not Z), it must be aromatic. The only C6 aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene.

    # --- Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Answer ---
    # Reaction: Mixture X -> Mixture Y (disproportionation).
    # This is a 1:1 reaction of components due to the equimolar mixtures.
    # X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2
    # By the law of conservation of atoms, the total atoms in reactants must equal the total in products.
    # The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.
    # This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.

    # --- Step 4: Verify the Plausibility of Mixture X Components ---
    # Constraint: Both components of X hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane), so they are C6 cyclic compounds.
    # Constraint: They decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated.
    # Constraint: They have no conjugated multiple bonds.
    # Let's check if candidates exist that sum to the calculated H atoms.
