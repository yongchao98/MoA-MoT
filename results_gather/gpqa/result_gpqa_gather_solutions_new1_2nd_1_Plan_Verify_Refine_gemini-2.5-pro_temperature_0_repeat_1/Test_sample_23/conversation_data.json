  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nIf an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen.

Analysis of Substance Z**\n*   **Constraint**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is approximately 1/7.\n*   **Derivation**: For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Constraint**: Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Constraint**: Z is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Conclusion**: The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This identification is consistent across all candidate answers and the code output.\n\n**2. Analysis of Mixture Y**\n*   **Constraint**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Derivation**: Let the other component be Y₂. Since Y₂ hydrogenates to cyclohexane, it must have a C₆ skeleton. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it must be saturated or aromatic. The only logical candidate is benzene (C₆H₆), which is aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆). This is also consistent across all analyses.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   **Constraint**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids that have no conjugated multiple bonds. It reacts via disproportionation to form mixture Y.\n*   **Reaction**: X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   **Derivation (Conservation of Atoms)**: The total number of atoms in the products is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, the total number of atoms in the two reactant molecules (X₁ and X₂) must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   **Derivation (Identity of X₁ and X₂)**: Since both components of X hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must be C₆ cyclic compounds. We need two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is a valid candidate.\n    *   For the other component (C₆H₈), we must choose the non-conjugated isomer, which is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus ruled out.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). This identification is consistent across all detailed analyses.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated value is 18. The given options are A) 16, B) 18, C) 22, D) 12. The correct option is B.\n\nThe reasoning in almost all candidate answers and the code output correctly derives the value 18. Many of the candidate answers then incorrectly select a letter that does not correspond to 18. However, the chemical logic is sound and points unambiguously to 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of hydrogen in such a compound is (2n × 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   Z is also described as being saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent.\n*   These clues strongly point to Z being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which is a very common cycloalkane solvent.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   A compound that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromatic stability prevents it from reacting with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Disproportionation Reaction and Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n*   The reaction can be written as:\n    Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n*   Let's calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of each component of mixture Y):\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) = 12\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in benzene (C₆H₆) = 6\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Verification of the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We can verify this conclusion by identifying the likely components of mixture X.\n*   They must both be C₆ cyclic compounds (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), they must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and they must not have conjugated double bonds.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds.\n*   Let's check the total hydrogen atoms for this pair: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our conclusion from Step 3.\n*   The reaction is a classic hydrogen transfer: the diene (C₆H₈) donates hydrogen to become benzene (C₆H₆), and the ene (C₆H₁₀) accepts hydrogen to become cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). All conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the disproportionation reaction, this number is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step verification of the chemical problem, here is the consolidated reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Substance Z**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify substance Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon, this corresponds to a general formula of CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane. Given that it is a widely used solvent, the most logical and common compound fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). The entire mixture Y hydrogenates under severe conditions to yield only cyclohexane. This means the second component must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton and must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The fact that it doesn't decolorize bromine water points to it being an aromatic compound, as they are unreactive to bromine water without a specific catalyst. The only C₆ aromatic hydrocarbon is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This deduction is consistent across all provided answers.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids that undergoes disproportionation upon heating with platinum to form mixture Y. The reaction is:\nLiquid A + Liquid B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)\n\nBy the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n*   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules comprising mixture X must also have a total of 12 carbon and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nSince hydrogenation of mixture X yields only cyclohexane, both liquids in X must be C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons. The problem states they are unsaturated but do not have conjugated multiple bonds. The most logical candidates are:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**\n*   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)** (The 1,3-isomer is excluded as it is conjugated).\n\nChecking the sum of atoms for this pair: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ = C₁₂H₁₈. This matches the products perfectly. The reaction involves the transfer of two hydrogen atoms from cyclohexa-1,4-diene to cyclohexene. This reasoning is sound and unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe final numerical answer is 18. This corresponds to option A. While several candidate answers correctly derived the number 18, they incorrectly mapped it to options B, C, or D. The correct mapping is 18 to A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem and a review of the provided candidate answers, the correct solution is derived as follows.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**: The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is approximately 2n:12n, which simplifies to 1:6. The mass fraction of hydrogen is therefore 2/(12+2) = 2/14 ≈ 14.3%. Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be saturated, confirming it is a cycloalkane. The clue that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The other component must also yield cyclohexane upon hydrogenation under severe conditions. The most logical candidate that fits these criteria (part of a disproportionation product, doesn't react with bromine water, hydrogenates to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Reaction and Mixture X**: Mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form mixture Y. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   Reaction: Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)\n    *   Since the reaction is between equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the two molecules that constitute mixture X must also have a combined formula of C₁₂H₁₈.\n\n4.  **Calculation of the Final Answer**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms from the reaction, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X is **18**.\n\n*   For verification, the components of mixture X must be two C₆ unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The pair that fits is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, confirming the result.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a compound with the empirical formula CH₂ (since the mass ratio of C:H is 12:2, or 6:1, and the mass fraction of H is 1/(6+1) = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%).\n*   The molecular formula is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Z is described as saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"), which means it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also a \"widely used solvent\". The most common and well-known cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   This identification is consistent with all the facts provided.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated, yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton and must be convertible to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated or aromatic. As it is not cyclohexane itself, the most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions, and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   The formation of a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound is the classic outcome of a catalytic disproportionation reaction of unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y.\n*   The reaction is: Liquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y).\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n*   Total atoms in the products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X (A and B) must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   We are told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane, so both A and B must be C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated.\n*   The problem specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n*   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical candidates are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond, so no conjugation.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two isolated double bonds, so it is not conjugated. (The isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   Let's check if this pair fits the reaction:\n    *   Reactants: Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)\n    *   Products: Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)\n    *   This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene loses two hydrogen atoms to become benzene, and the cyclohexene gains those two hydrogen atoms to become cyclohexane. This fits all the problem's constraints.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid A is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid B is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a compound with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is approximately 2:12 or 1:6, leading to a hydrogen mass fraction of 1/(1+6) = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ is a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. A classic example of such a reaction involving a C₆ ring is the catalytic conversion of an unsaturated precursor into both a fully saturated ring (cyclohexane) and a fully unsaturated aromatic ring (benzene).\n*   The other component is therefore **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and the Core Reaction**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that undergoes disproportionation when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n*   The overall reaction is: Liquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y).\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   Total atoms in the products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Based on the conservation of atoms in the balanced chemical reaction, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules (one of each liquid in mixture X) must be 18.\n\n**5. Confirmation of the Components of Mixture X**\n*   To be certain, we can identify the components of X. They must both be C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), non-conjugated, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check the hydrogen count: 10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from cyclohexa-1,4-diene) = 18. This matches our conclusion from the conservation of atoms.\n*   These components fit all the conditions: they are unsaturated, cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated, and both have a C₆ skeleton.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct points from the provided answers and ensuring a logical flow to the correct conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (does not react further with hydrogen).\n*   **Analysis:** A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`\n    *   `7y ≈ 12x + y`\n    *   `6y ≈ 12x`\n    *   `y ≈ 2x`\n*   This gives an empirical formula of CH₂ and a general molecular formula of CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it cannot be an alkene. Therefore, it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   The problem states Z is a widely used solvent. The most common and well-known cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the criteria for Z.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Mixture Y contains cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, as hydrogenating it yields cyclohexane.\n    *   This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic. Since it's not cyclohexane itself, it must be an aromatic compound.\n    *   The aromatic compound with a C₆ skeleton is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   **Information:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water (unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. It undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y.\n    *   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction is a 1:1 transformation: `Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also sum to C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Since both components of X hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must both be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let them be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ, where a + b = 18.\n    *   We need two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds. The most logical candidates are:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond, so no conjugation.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**: Has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated). The isomer, cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is conjugated and thus excluded by the problem statement.\n    *   Let's check if this pair fits: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ = C₁₂H₁₈. This matches the atom balance. The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Question:** Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Liquid 1 (Cyclohexene) has the formula C₆H₁₀, containing **10** hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) has the formula C₆H₈, containing **8** hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of compounds with the empirical formula CH₂ (since the mass ratio of C:H is 12:2, or 6:1, the H fraction is 1/(6+1) = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%).\n    *   The general formula is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Z is described as saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), which means it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The fact that Z is a widely used solvent strongly suggests it is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, a very common laboratory solvent. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula for n=6.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This implies its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is one component of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    *   A compound that fits these criteria (does not react with Br₂ water but hydrogenates to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. The disproportionation of unsaturated C₆ rings to form cyclohexane and benzene is a classic reaction (Zelinsky disproportionation).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the two molecules A and B from mixture X must have a combined formula of C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   The problem states that both components of X hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane), so they must both be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let their formulas be C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ. This means x + y = 18.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene. The non-conjugated isomer is **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Let's check if this pair fits:\n        *   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This is correct.\n        *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings. Correct.\n        *   Neither has conjugated bonds.

Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   **Information:** Z is a saturated hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   **Analysis:** A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane. The problem states Z is a widely used solvent, which strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, does not decolorize bromine water, and contains Z as one of its components. Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component of Y is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton (since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and must not decolorize bromine water (meaning it's saturated or aromatic). The only logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Information:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids with no conjugated bonds. It undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction is a hydrogen transfer:\n    `Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n    By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also sum to C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since both components of X hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must both be C₆ cyclic compounds. We need to find two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   The most common C₆ unsaturated cyclic compounds are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈).\n    *   The problem states no conjugated bonds, so we must use **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**, not the conjugated cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n    *   Let's test this pair: **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture X consists of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene. This fits all conditions: both are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and their disproportionation (hydrogen transfer from the diene to the ene) correctly yields cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Question:** Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) = 8\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\nThis value corresponds to option B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most derive the correct number (18), many select the wrong final letter. Answers 2 and 11 correctly perform the derivation and select the matching option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7.\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7` gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y ≈ 12x`, or `y ≈ 2x`.\n*   This means Z has the empirical formula CH₂ and the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated or aromatic. As it is part of a disproportionation product with cyclohexane, it is the oxidized counterpart. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that undergoes disproportionation when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n*   The reaction is: Liquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y).\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n*   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Since both components of X hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane, they must both be C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons. Let them be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₓ, where a + x = 18.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so its components are unsaturated.\n*   The problem specifies there are no conjugated multiple bonds. This rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n*   The logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and the non-conjugated **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check if this pair fits:\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the products.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer, which is a type of disproportionation.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem presented and a review of the candidate answers, a consistent line of reasoning emerges.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z:**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is approximately 2:12, or 1:6, leading to a hydrogen mass fraction of 1/7 ≈ 14.3%. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent, it is identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This conclusion is unanimously reached in all detailed analyses.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y:**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton because hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane. For this second component not to decolorize bromine water, it must be saturated or aromatic. Since it's not cyclohexane itself, it must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions but is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This deduction is also consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and the Core Calculation:**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids that undergoes a disproportionation reaction (a hydrogen transfer) to form mixture Y. The reaction is:\nLiquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)\n\nBy the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules must equal the total number in the two product molecules.\n*   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n*   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verification of Mixture X Components:**\nTo verify this, the components of mixture X must be two C₆ unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that, when added together, have 18 hydrogen atoms. They also must not have conjugated double bonds. The logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated, fitting the problem's constraint.\nThis confirms the calculation based on atom conservation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll provided analyses correctly deduce that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. The options given are A) 22, B) 12, C) 18, and D) 16. The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is approximately 2n:12n, which simplifies to 1:6. The mass fraction of hydrogen is therefore 2 / (12 + 2) = 2/14 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   Z is also described as being saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent. This strongly suggests that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, a very common cycloalkane solvent.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yields only cyclohexane. This means the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and be convertible to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, the most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water under normal conditions, but it is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated. The problem also specifies they do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   When heated with platinum, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall balanced reaction is:\n    Liquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Since both components of X hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane, they must both be C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons. Let their formulas be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ. We know that a + b = 18.\n*   The most logical non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**. (The isomer cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   Let's check if this pair fits: The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent. The reaction involves the transfer of two hydrogen atoms from cyclohexa-1,4-diene (which becomes benzene) to cyclohexene (which becomes cyclohexane). This fits all the conditions.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1 is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2 is cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis numerical answer corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logical steps from the provided answers and identifying the correct final choice.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Constraint:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is saturated.\n*   **Analysis:** A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of H is approximately y / (12x + y). Setting this to 1/7 gives 7y ≈ 12x + y, which simplifies to 6y ≈ 12x, or y ≈ 2x. The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane. The problem states it is a widely used solvent, which strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is consistent across all candidate answers and is chemically sound.\n\n**2. Identify Mixture Y**\n*   **Constraints:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Let the components of Y be Z (cyclohexane) and Y₂. Since Y₂ can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it must have a C₆ skeleton. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated (which would make it an isomer of cyclohexane, an unlikely scenario for this reaction type) or aromatic. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which does not react with bromine water but hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions. The formation of a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound is the hallmark of the disproportionation reaction mentioned.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Identify Mixture X and the Reaction**\n*   **Constraints:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water (unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. It undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction is:\n    Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also have a total composition of C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since both components of X hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must both be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let them be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ. This means a + b = 18.\n*   The components must be unsaturated and non-conjugated. The most logical candidates are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**\n    *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)** (The 1,3-isomer is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   This pair fits all conditions: both are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and their hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   **Question:** Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:** This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) = 8\n    *   **Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.**\n\n**5. Match to Options**\n*   The calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n*   The given options are:\n    A) 22\n    B) 16\n    C) 18\n    D) 12\n*   The calculated result of 18 corresponds to option C.\n\nWhile many of the candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis to arrive at the number 18, several failed to map this result to the correct letter option. The correct reasoning leads unequivocally to 18, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a classic chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying the compounds involved.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of compounds with the empirical formula CH₂.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a compound with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ is:\n    Mass % H = (2n × 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This means the other component of Y must also have a C₆ skeleton and must be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   The most plausible candidate for the second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. This is a characteristic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction is:\n    Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products. Since the mixtures are equimolar, we can consider the reaction of one molecule of each component:\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms, this total must be **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Identities of the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We need to find two liquids, A and B, that fit the remaining criteria:\n    1.  Both have a C₆ skeleton (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane).\n    2.  Both are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water).\n    3.  They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    4.  Their atoms sum to C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has two non-conjugated double bonds.\n    *   The sum of their atoms is C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   This pair of compounds perfectly fits all the conditions described in the problem. The disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer from the diene to the ene.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules (cyclohexane and benzene) is 12 + 6 = 18. Due to the conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules (the liquids in mixture X) must also be 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem presented, here is a careful breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a specific class of hydrocarbons.\n*   The value 14.28% is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7.\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   This means Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   The only common compound that fits these criteria (has a C₆ skeleton, does not decolorize bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromatic stability prevents it from reacting with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Conservation of Atoms**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted into mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction is: (Liquid A from X) + (Liquid B from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. We can find this by simply summing the hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**Step 4: Confirmation of the Identity of Mixture X**\n\n*   To ensure the solution is consistent, we can identify the components of mixture X. They must be two C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), non-conjugated, and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check the conditions:\n    *   **Total Hydrogens**: 10 + 8 = 18. This is correct.\n    *   **Unsaturated**: Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water. This is correct.\n    *   **Non-conjugated**: Cyclohexene has one double bond. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has its two double bonds separated by CH₂ groups, so they are not conjugated. This is correct.\n    *   **Hydrogenation**: Both hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. This is correct.\n*   The proposed components for mixture X fit all the given constraints, confirming the logic.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules (cyclohexane and benzene) is 18. By the conservation of atoms in the 1:1 reaction, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules (the liquids of mixture X) must also be 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Execute Action (Deduction)**\n**Step 1: Identification of Substance Z**\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of H is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y ≈ 2x`. The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane. The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.

The fact that it doesn't decolorize bromine water means it is saturated or aromatic. Since it is not cyclohexane itself, it must be the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions but hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**4.

Analysis of Substance Z**\n*   **Constraint**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is approximately 1/7.\n*   **Derivation**: For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Constraint**: Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Constraint**: Z is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Conclusion**: The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This identification is consistent across all candidate answers and the code output.\n\n**2. Analysis of Mixture Y**\n*   **Constraint**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Derivation**: Let the other component be Y₂. Since Y₂ hydrogenates to cyclohexane, it must have a C₆ skeleton. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it must be saturated or aromatic. The only logical candidate is benzene (C₆H₆), which is aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆). This is also consistent across all analyses.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   **Constraint**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids that have no conjugated multiple bonds. It reacts via disproportionation to form mixture Y.\n*   **Reaction**: X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   **Derivation (Conservation of Atoms)**: The total number of atoms in the products is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, the total number of atoms in the two reactant molecules (X₁ and X₂) must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   **Derivation (Identity of X₁ and X₂)**: Since both components of X hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must be C₆ cyclic compounds. We need two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is a valid candidate.\n    *   For the other component (C₆H₈), we must choose the non-conjugated isomer, which is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus ruled out.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). This identification is consistent across all detailed analyses.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated value is 18. The given options are A) 16, B) 18, C) 22, D) 12. The correct option is B.\n\nThe reasoning in almost all candidate answers and the code output correctly derives the value 18. Many of the candidate answers then incorrectly select a letter that does not correspond to 18. However, the chemical logic is sound and points unambiguously to 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of hydrogen in such a compound is (2n × 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   Z is also described as being saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent.\n*   These clues strongly point to Z being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which is a very common cycloalkane solvent.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   A compound that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromatic stability prevents it from reacting with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Disproportionation Reaction and Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n*   The reaction can be written as:\n    Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n*   Let's calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of each component of mixture Y):\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) = 12\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in benzene (C₆H₆) = 6\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Verification of the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We can verify this conclusion by identifying the likely components of mixture X.\n*   They must both be C₆ cyclic compounds (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), they must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and they must not have conjugated double bonds.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds.\n*   Let's check the total hydrogen atoms for this pair: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our conclusion from Step 3.\n*   The reaction is a classic hydrogen transfer: the diene (C₆H₈) donates hydrogen to become benzene (C₆H₆), and the ene (C₆H₁₀) accepts hydrogen to become cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). All conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the disproportionation reaction, this number is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step verification of the chemical problem, here is the consolidated reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Substance Z**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify substance Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon, this corresponds to a general formula of CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane. Given that it is a widely used solvent, the most logical and common compound fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). The entire mixture Y hydrogenates under severe conditions to yield only cyclohexane. This means the second component must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton and must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The fact that it doesn't decolorize bromine water points to it being an aromatic compound, as they are unreactive to bromine water without a specific catalyst. The only C₆ aromatic hydrocarbon is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This deduction is consistent across all provided answers.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids that undergoes disproportionation upon heating with platinum to form mixture Y. The reaction is:\nLiquid A + Liquid B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)\n\nBy the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n*   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules comprising mixture X must also have a total of 12 carbon and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nSince hydrogenation of mixture X yields only cyclohexane, both liquids in X must be C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons. The problem states they are unsaturated but do not have conjugated multiple bonds. The most logical candidates are:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**\n*   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)** (The 1,3-isomer is excluded as it is conjugated).\n\nChecking the sum of atoms for this pair: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ = C₁₂H₁₈. This matches the products perfectly. The reaction involves the transfer of two hydrogen atoms from cyclohexa-1,4-diene to cyclohexene. This reasoning is sound and unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe final numerical answer is 18. This corresponds to option A. While several candidate answers correctly derived the number 18, they incorrectly mapped it to options B, C, or D. The correct mapping is 18 to A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem and a review of the provided candidate answers, the correct solution is derived as follows.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**: The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is approximately 2n:12n, which simplifies to 1:6. The mass fraction of hydrogen is therefore 2/(12+2) = 2/14 ≈ 14.3%. Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be saturated, confirming it is a cycloalkane. The clue that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The other component must also yield cyclohexane upon hydrogenation under severe conditions. The most logical candidate that fits these criteria (part of a disproportionation product, doesn't react with bromine water, hydrogenates to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Reaction and Mixture X**: Mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form mixture Y. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   Reaction: Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)\n    *   Since the reaction is between equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the two molecules that constitute mixture X must also have a combined formula of C₁₂H₁₈.\n\n4.  **Calculation of the Final Answer**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms from the reaction, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X is **18**.\n\n*   For verification, the components of mixture X must be two C₆ unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The pair that fits is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, confirming the result.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a compound with the empirical formula CH₂ (since the mass ratio of C:H is 12:2, or 6:1, and the mass fraction of H is 1/(6+1) = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%).\n*   The molecular formula is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Z is described as saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"), which means it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also a \"widely used solvent\". The most common and well-known cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   This identification is consistent with all the facts provided.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated, yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton and must be convertible to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated or aromatic. As it is not cyclohexane itself, the most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions, and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   The formation of a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound is the classic outcome of a catalytic disproportionation reaction of unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y.\n*   The reaction is: Liquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y).\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n*   Total atoms in the products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X (A and B) must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   We are told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane, so both A and B must be C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated.\n*   The problem specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n*   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical candidates are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond, so no conjugation.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two isolated double bonds, so it is not conjugated. (The isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   Let's check if this pair fits the reaction:\n    *   Reactants: Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)\n    *   Products: Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)\n    *   This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene loses two hydrogen atoms to become benzene, and the cyclohexene gains those two hydrogen atoms to become cyclohexane. This fits all the problem's constraints.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid A is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid B is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a compound with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is approximately 2:12 or 1:6, leading to a hydrogen mass fraction of 1/(1+6) = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ is a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. A classic example of such a reaction involving a C₆ ring is the catalytic conversion of an unsaturated precursor into both a fully saturated ring (cyclohexane) and a fully unsaturated aromatic ring (benzene).\n*   The other component is therefore **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and the Core Reaction**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that undergoes disproportionation when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n*   The overall reaction is: Liquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y).\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n*   Total atoms in the products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Based on the conservation of atoms in the balanced chemical reaction, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules (one of each liquid in mixture X) must be 18.\n\n**5. Confirmation of the Components of Mixture X**\n*   To be certain, we can identify the components of X. They must both be C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), non-conjugated, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check the hydrogen count: 10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from cyclohexa-1,4-diene) = 18. This matches our conclusion from the conservation of atoms.\n*   These components fit all the conditions: they are unsaturated, cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated, and both have a C₆ skeleton.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct points from the provided answers and ensuring a logical flow to the correct conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (does not react further with hydrogen).\n*   **Analysis:** A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`\n    *   `7y ≈ 12x + y`\n    *   `6y ≈ 12x`\n    *   `y ≈ 2x`\n*   This gives an empirical formula of CH₂ and a general molecular formula of CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it cannot be an alkene. Therefore, it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   The problem states Z is a widely used solvent. The most common and well-known cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the criteria for Z.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Mixture Y contains cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, as hydrogenating it yields cyclohexane.\n    *   This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic. Since it's not cyclohexane itself, it must be an aromatic compound.\n    *   The aromatic compound with a C₆ skeleton is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   **Information:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water (unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. It undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y.\n    *   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction is a 1:1 transformation: `Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also sum to C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Since both components of X hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must both be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let them be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ, where a + b = 18.\n    *   We need two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds. The most logical candidates are:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond, so no conjugation.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**: Has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated). The isomer, cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is conjugated and thus excluded by the problem statement.\n    *   Let's check if this pair fits: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ = C₁₂H₁₈. This matches the atom balance. The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Question:** Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Liquid 1 (Cyclohexene) has the formula C₆H₁₀, containing **10** hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) has the formula C₆H₈, containing **8** hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of compounds with the empirical formula CH₂ (since the mass ratio of C:H is 12:2, or 6:1, the H fraction is 1/(6+1) = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%).\n    *   The general formula is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Z is described as saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), which means it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The fact that Z is a widely used solvent strongly suggests it is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, a very common laboratory solvent. This fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula for n=6.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This implies its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is one component of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    *   A compound that fits these criteria (does not react with Br₂ water but hydrogenates to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. The disproportionation of unsaturated C₆ rings to form cyclohexane and benzene is a classic reaction (Zelinsky disproportionation).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the two molecules A and B from mixture X must have a combined formula of C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   The problem states that both components of X hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane), so they must both be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let their formulas be C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ. This means x + y = 18.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene. The non-conjugated isomer is **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Let's check if this pair fits:\n        *   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This is correct.\n        *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings. Correct.\n        *   Neither has conjugated bonds. Correct.\n        *   The reaction C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ is a balanced hydrogen transfer.

Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   **Information:** Z is a saturated hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   **Analysis:** A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane. The problem states Z is a widely used solvent, which strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, does not decolorize bromine water, and contains Z as one of its components. Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component of Y is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton (since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and must not decolorize bromine water (meaning it's saturated or aromatic). The only logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Information:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids with no conjugated bonds. It undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction is a hydrogen transfer:\n    `Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n    By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also sum to C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since both components of X hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must both be C₆ cyclic compounds. We need to find two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   The most common C₆ unsaturated cyclic compounds are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈).\n    *   The problem states no conjugated bonds, so we must use **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**, not the conjugated cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n    *   Let's test this pair: **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture X consists of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene. This fits all conditions: both are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and their disproportionation (hydrogen transfer from the diene to the ene) correctly yields cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Question:** Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) = 8\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\nThis value corresponds to option B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most derive the correct number (18), many select the wrong final letter. Answers 2 and 11 correctly perform the derivation and select the matching option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7.\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7` gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y ≈ 12x`, or `y ≈ 2x`.\n*   This means Z has the empirical formula CH₂ and the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated or aromatic. As it is part of a disproportionation product with cyclohexane, it is the oxidized counterpart. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that undergoes disproportionation when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n*   The reaction is: Liquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y).\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n*   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Since both components of X hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane, they must both be C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons. Let them be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₓ, where a + x = 18.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so its components are unsaturated.\n*   The problem specifies there are no conjugated multiple bonds. This rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n*   The logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and the non-conjugated **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check if this pair fits:\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the products.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer, which is a type of disproportionation.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem presented and a review of the candidate answers, a consistent line of reasoning emerges.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z:**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is approximately 2:12, or 1:6, leading to a hydrogen mass fraction of 1/7 ≈ 14.3%. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent, it is identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This conclusion is unanimously reached in all detailed analyses.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y:**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton because hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane. For this second component not to decolorize bromine water, it must be saturated or aromatic. Since it's not cyclohexane itself, it must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions but is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This deduction is also consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and the Core Calculation:**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids that undergoes a disproportionation reaction (a hydrogen transfer) to form mixture Y. The reaction is:\nLiquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)\n\nBy the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules must equal the total number in the two product molecules.\n*   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n*   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verification of Mixture X Components:**\nTo verify this, the components of mixture X must be two C₆ unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that, when added together, have 18 hydrogen atoms. They also must not have conjugated double bonds. The logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated, fitting the problem's constraint.\nThis confirms the calculation based on atom conservation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll provided analyses correctly deduce that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. The options given are A) 22, B) 12, C) 18, and D) 16. The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is approximately 2n:12n, which simplifies to 1:6. The mass fraction of hydrogen is therefore 2 / (12 + 2) = 2/14 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   Z is also described as being saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent. This strongly suggests that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, a very common cycloalkane solvent.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yields only cyclohexane. This means the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and be convertible to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, the most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water under normal conditions, but it is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated. The problem also specifies they do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   When heated with platinum, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall balanced reaction is:\n    Liquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Since both components of X hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane, they must both be C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons. Let their formulas be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ. We know that a + b = 18.\n*   The most logical non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**. (The isomer cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   Let's check if this pair fits: The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent. The reaction involves the transfer of two hydrogen atoms from cyclohexa-1,4-diene (which becomes benzene) to cyclohexene (which becomes cyclohexane). This fits all the conditions.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1 is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2 is cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis numerical answer corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logical steps from the provided answers and identifying the correct final choice.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Constraint:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is saturated.\n*   **Analysis:** A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of H is approximately y / (12x + y). Setting this to 1/7 gives 7y ≈ 12x + y, which simplifies to 6y ≈ 12x, or y ≈ 2x. The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane. The problem states it is a widely used solvent, which strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is consistent across all candidate answers and is chemically sound.\n\n**2. Identify Mixture Y**\n*   **Constraints:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Let the components of Y be Z (cyclohexane) and Y₂. Since Y₂ can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it must have a C₆ skeleton. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated (which would make it an isomer of cyclohexane, an unlikely scenario for this reaction type) or aromatic. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which does not react with bromine water but hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions. The formation of a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound is the hallmark of the disproportionation reaction mentioned.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Identify Mixture X and the Reaction**\n*   **Constraints:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water (unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. It undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction is:\n    Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also have a total composition of C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since both components of X hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must both be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let them be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ. This means a + b = 18.\n*   The components must be unsaturated and non-conjugated. The most logical candidates are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**\n    *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)** (The 1,3-isomer is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   This pair fits all conditions: both are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and their hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   **Question:** Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:** This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) = 8\n    *   **Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.**\n\n**5. Match to Options**\n*   The calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n*   The given options are:\n    A) 22\n    B) 16\n    C) 18\n    D) 12\n*   The calculated result of 18 corresponds to option C.\n\nWhile many of the candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis to arrive at the number 18, several failed to map this result to the correct letter option. The correct reasoning leads unequivocally to 18, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a classic chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying the compounds involved.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of compounds with the empirical formula CH₂.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a compound with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ is:\n    Mass % H = (2n × 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This means the other component of Y must also have a C₆ skeleton and must be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   The most plausible candidate for the second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. This is a characteristic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction is:\n    Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products. Since the mixtures are equimolar, we can consider the reaction of one molecule of each component:\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms, this total must be **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Identities of the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We need to find two liquids, A and B, that fit the remaining criteria:\n    1.  Both have a C₆ skeleton (since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane).\n    2.  Both are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water).\n    3.  They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    4.  Their atoms sum to C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has two non-conjugated double bonds.\n    *   The sum of their atoms is C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   This pair of compounds perfectly fits all the conditions described in the problem. The disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer from the diene to the ene.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules (cyclohexane and benzene) is 12 + 6 = 18. Due to the conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules (the liquids in mixture X) must also be 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem presented, here is a careful breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a specific class of hydrocarbons.\n*   The value 14.28% is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7.\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   This means Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   Given that Z is a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   The only common compound that fits these criteria (has a C₆ skeleton, does not decolorize bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromatic stability prevents it from reacting with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Conservation of Atoms**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted into mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction is: (Liquid A from X) + (Liquid B from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. We can find this by simply summing the hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**Step 4: Confirmation of the Identity of Mixture X**\n\n*   To ensure the solution is consistent, we can identify the components of mixture X. They must be two C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), non-conjugated, and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check the conditions:\n    *   **Total Hydrogens**: 10 + 8 = 18. This is correct.\n    *   **Unsaturated**: Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water. This is correct.\n    *   **Non-conjugated**: Cyclohexene has one double bond. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has its two double bonds separated by CH₂ groups, so they are not conjugated. This is correct.\n    *   **Hydrogenation**: Both hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. This is correct.\n*   The proposed components for mixture X fit all the given constraints, confirming the logic.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules (cyclohexane and benzene) is 18. By the conservation of atoms in the 1:1 reaction, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules (the liquids of mixture X) must also be 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
