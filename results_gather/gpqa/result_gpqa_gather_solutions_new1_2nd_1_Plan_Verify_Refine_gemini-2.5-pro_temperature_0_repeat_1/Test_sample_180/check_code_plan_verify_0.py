    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the solar neutrino flux problem.

    The function models the physical scenario described in the question:
    1. It sets relative flux values for the relevant neutrino sources (CNO, 7Be).
    2. It calculates the flux in the two specified energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV)
       under the condition that the pp-III branch (source of 8B neutrinos) has stopped.
    3. It computes the expected ratio of the fluxes.
    4. It compares this expected ratio to the value of the chosen answer option.
