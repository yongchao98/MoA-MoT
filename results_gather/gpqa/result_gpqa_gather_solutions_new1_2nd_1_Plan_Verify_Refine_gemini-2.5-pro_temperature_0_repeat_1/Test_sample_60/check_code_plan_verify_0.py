    Checks the correctness of the final answer for a multi-step organic synthesis problem.

    The function verifies the proposed answer against constraints derived from the reaction steps:
    1.  Nitration of benzene, then bromination (meta-directing).
    2.  Reduction of nitro to amine.
    3.  Diazotization.
    4.  Gomberg-Bachmann reaction with anisole (para-coupling favored).
