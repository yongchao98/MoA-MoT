    radius_component = radius_ratio ** 2

    # 3. The temperature ratio T1/T2 must be determined.
    #    T ∝ 1/λ_rest => T1/T2 = λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1
    #    The observed wavelengths are equal: λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2
    #    Doppler effect: λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1 (v1=0)
    #                    λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c) (non-relativistic redshift)
    #    So, λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)
    #    => λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)
    #    Therefore, T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)
