The IR data indicating a primary amine (two N-H bands) eliminated candidates C and D, which are amides.\n    2.  The IR data for an ester C=O stretch was consistent with the remaining candidates, A and B.\n    3.  The NMR data for para-substitution was also consistent with both A and B.\n    4.  The final, decisive constraint was the NMR chemical shift of the ethyl group's quartet at 4.5 ppm. This specific shift is characteristic of an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂-), as found in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (A). Candidate B, 4-aminophenyl propionate, would have this quartet at a much different chemical shift (~2.5 ppm), leading to its elimination.\n*   **Conclusion:** After applying all constraints, only candidate A, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, remained.

Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   For C9H11NO2: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This finding immediately rules out any structures that are secondary or tertiary amines, or amides with only one N-H bond.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is typical for an **ester**, particularly one that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The different chemical shifts indicate that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe combined data points to a single structure:\n*   A **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which is an electron-donating group.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**, which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check it against the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted compound, which would give a more complex NMR aromatic pattern. It is also an amide, not an ester.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this structure, the ethyl group is part of a propionate chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The methylene group's quartet would appear around 2.5 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only structure that is fully consistent with the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   For C9H11NO2, the calculation is: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This finding immediately makes options with secondary amines (like C) or amides less likely or incorrect.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) being split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-) being split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This very downfield shift indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a characteristic signal for the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in their chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, causing the upfield shift to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, causing the downfield shift to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which is an electron-donating group.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**, which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPlacing these fragments together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be part of a propionate group (-COCH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This compound is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\nThe evidence from all spectroscopic methods points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Formula:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2.

This frequency is typical for an **ester functional group**, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal to build the structure's fragments:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is a definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) being split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-) being split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.

The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are shifted far downfield, indicating they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester).\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are shifted upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nThe combined data points to a single structure:\n*   A **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nThis assembly gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of the acid chain (-COCH₂CH₃). The methylene quartet would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (different IR C=O frequency) and is 1,3- (meta) substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two clean doublets. This is incorrect.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   **Result:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.

This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded), indicating they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded), indicating they are ortho to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\nBased on the combined analysis of all the data, the molecule consists of:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nPutting these fragments together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer where the ester linkage is Ar-O-CO-R. The methylene protons of the ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) would be adjacent to the carbonyl, not the oxygen, and would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, which contradicts the observed 4.5 ppm signal.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (not an ester) and is meta-substituted (not para). This contradicts the IR C=O frequency and the NMR aromatic splitting pattern.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two. It also lacks the primary amine protons in the NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectral data is unequivocally consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   **Result:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2.

Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester functional group**, particularly one that is conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-) split by the adjacent three protons. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.

This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted primary amide. This is inconsistent with the NMR aromatic pattern (para) and the IR carbonyl frequency (ester, not amide).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a para-substituted ring.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of a propionate chain (-COCH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for the methylene (-CH₂-) group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only compound that is fully consistent with all the provided IR and ¹H NMR data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional pi bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This immediately rules out candidate D, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. This makes an ester (like A or C) more likely than an amide (like B or D), as amides typically absorb at a lower frequency (e.g., ~1680 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Aromatic Region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   This rules out candidate B, 3-ethoxybenzamide, which is 1,3-disubstituted (meta) and would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n*   **Alkyl/Functional Group Region:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This very downfield shift indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   Let's compare this to candidate A, 4-aminophenyl propionate. In that molecule, the ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl, and its chemical shift would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Therefore, candidate A is incorrect.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe combined spectral data points to a single structure:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's verify this against the provided options.\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR for the ethyl group does not match.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. It is meta-substituted and an amide.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all IR and NMR data.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. It is a secondary amide, not a primary amine.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the provided answers correctly identify the structure as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate through their reasoning, even if some of them output an incorrect final letter due to inconsistent labeling of the options. The chemical analysis is unambiguous.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   For C9H11NO2: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This finding immediately makes option D, a secondary amide, unlikely.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a simple amide (like in option A), which usually appears below 1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). This strongly suggests an **ethyl ester** fragment. This evidence rules out option C (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the methylene quartet would be next to a carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The presence of two clean doublets, each for two protons, indicates para substitution. This rules out option A (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is meta-substituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   The chemical shifts indicate one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons to ~8.0 ppm). This is perfectly consistent with an electron-donating amine (-NH₂) and an electron-withdrawing ester (-COOEt) group in a para arrangement.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe combined spectral data points unequivocally to a structure with:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. It is meta-substituted and an amide.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided IR and ¹H NMR data.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR for the ethyl group would be different (quartet at ~2.5 ppm).\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. It is a secondary amide, not a primary amine.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which is typically < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-) split by the adjacent three protons.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group is donating, and the ester group is withdrawing, which perfectly fits this observation.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\nThe combined data points to a single structure: a para-disubstituted benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern and the IR carbonyl frequency.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would only show one N-H band in the IR, not two.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided spectral data.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of a propionate chain (-COCH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for the methylene (-CH₂-) group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nThe analysis from the other agents is correct in identifying the structure as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, but there is confusion in mapping that name to the correct letter. Based on the options provided in the question, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The calculation `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)` yields `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This immediately casts doubt on any structure that is not a primary amine, such as option C (a secondary amide).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** functional group. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out option A, which is 1,3-disubstituted (meta).\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):**\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) together confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is crucial. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options\nThe combined data points to a single structure:\n*   A **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nThis assembly leads directly to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is meta-substituted and an amide.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this structure, the ethyl group is part of a propionate chain attached to the ester oxygen. The methylene protons (-COCH₂CH₃) would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data indicating a primary amine.\n*   D) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches every piece of data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and ester groups from the IR, and the ethyl ester and para-substituted ring patterns from the NMR.\n\nThe vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate through their chemical analysis, even if some selected the wrong final letter due to apparent labeling errors. The chemical evidence is unambiguous.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the given spectral data.\n\n**1.

Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This finding makes options with secondary amines or amides less likely or allows for their elimination.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** functional group. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which typically appears below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains both a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3.

Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This single piece of evidence allows us to eliminate any candidate that is not a primary amine.\n    *   **Eliminates D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide.\n    *   **Eliminates C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is a primary amide. The C=O stretch for an amide is typically lower (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to two protons, are the unmistakable pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   This confirms the elimination of **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This significant downfield shift indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   This allows us to distinguish between the remaining candidates A and B.\n    *   **Eliminates B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**.

These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This finding immediately makes options with secondary amides (like B) or primary amides (like D) less likely or incorrect, pending other data.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons. The quartet (q) is the methylene group (-CH₂-) split by the adjacent three protons. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is crucial; it indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar broadening from the nitrogen nucleus. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded) because they are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded) because they are adjacent to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nThe combined evidence points to a single structure:\n*   A **para-disubstituted benzene ring**...\n*   ...with a **primary amine (-NH₂) group** at one position...\n*   ...and an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group** at the other.\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two. It would also have a formyl proton signal in the NMR. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer where the ester linkage is reversed. The ethyl group would be part of a propionate chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (incorrect C=O frequency) and is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two clean doublets. Incorrect.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most of them correctly identify the structure through their reasoning, several have typographical errors in the final letter they output. The chemical reasoning across the board overwhelmingly supports ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided data and candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   For C9H11NO2, the DoU is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This is a crucial point that eliminates any structures that are not primary amines.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which would be <1700 cm⁻¹) and fits perfectly for an ester attached to a benzene ring.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is definitive for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This eliminates any structures with other substitution patterns (like meta or ortho).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The key detail is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene (-CH₂-) group appearing this far downfield indicates it is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's evaluate each option against the evidence gathered:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** A para-substituted benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Fit:** This structure perfectly matches every piece of data. It has a primary amine (IR, NMR at 4.0 ppm), a para-substituted ring (NMR at 7.0/8.0 ppm), and an ethyl ester group with the characteristic -O-CH₂- quartet at 4.5 ppm. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:**\n    *   **Structure:** An ester where the ethyl group is part of the acid portion (-OCOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Fit:** The methylene (-CH₂-) group is adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen. Its NMR signal would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. **This is inconsistent with the NMR data.**\n\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:**\n    *   **Structure:** A secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine.\n    *   **Fit:** This would only show one N-H band in the IR, not two. **This is inconsistent with the IR data.**\n\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:**\n    *   **Structure:** A 1,3- (meta) substituted ring.\n    *   **Fit:** The aromatic region of the NMR would show a more complex pattern, not two clean doublets. **This is inconsistent with the NMR data.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral data unequivocally points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The analysis provided by the majority of the agents correctly identifies the structure through chemical principles, even if some of them made a clerical error by selecting the wrong letter. The reasoning is sound and consistent: the compound must be a para-substituted primary amine with an ethyl ester functional group. Only option A fulfills all these requirements.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound.\n\n### **Plan**\n1.  Analyze the provided spectral data (IR and ¹H NMR) to deduce the key structural features of the unknown molecule.\n2.  Systematically evaluate each candidate structure against these features to eliminate incorrect options.\n3.  Confirm the identity of the correct structure by ensuring it matches all data points.\n4.  Select the final answer corresponding to the correct structure from the original list of options.\n\n### **Execution of the Plan**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** Two distinct bands in this region are the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This allows us to eliminate any structure that is not a primary amine.\n    *   Eliminates B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** A strong band in this region is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). The frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester**, which fits with the DoU calculation.\n    *   This makes C) 3-ethoxybenzamide, a primary amide (which typically has a C=O stretch < 1700 cm⁻¹), an unlikely candidate.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   This eliminates C) 3-ethoxybenzamide, which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would have a more complex splitting pattern.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most critical piece of information. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   This allows us to distinguish between the final two candidates, A and D.\n    *   In A) 4-aminophenyl propionate, the ethyl group is part of a propionate chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The methylene quartet would be next to a carbonyl, with a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This eliminates option A.\n    *   In D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the ethyl group is part of an ethyl ester (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃). The methylene quartet is next to the ester oxygen, which perfectly explains the downfield shift to 4.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** The broad singlet for two protons confirms the presence of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis systematically eliminates options A, B, and C. The only structure that is perfectly consistent with every piece of spectral data (DoU, IR, and ¹H NMR) is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   It is a **para-substituted** ring (NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   It has a **primary amine** (IR and NMR signals).\n*   It has an **ethyl ester** where the methylene protons are attached to oxygen (NMR quartet at 4.5 ppm).\n\nThis corresponds to option D in the provided list. The candidate answers from other agents all correctly identify the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate through their chemical reasoning, even though their final letter choices vary due to being presented with differently ordered option lists.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   For C9H11NO2: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This finding immediately rules out any structures that are secondary or tertiary amines, or amides with only one N-H bond.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is typical for an **ester**, particularly one that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The different chemical shifts indicate that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe combined data points to a single structure:\n*   A **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which is an electron-donating group.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**, which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

The methylene group's quartet would appear around 2.5 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only structure that is fully consistent with the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1.

Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This finding immediately makes options with secondary amines (like C) or amides less likely or incorrect.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Formula:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is typical for an **ester functional group**, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal to build the structure's fragments:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is a definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) being split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-) being split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to factors like chemical exchange and nitrogen's quadrupolar moment. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are shifted far downfield, indicating they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester).\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are shifted upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nThe combined data points to a single structure:\n*   A **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nThis assembly gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of the acid chain (-COCH₂CH₃). The methylene quartet would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (different IR C=O frequency) and is 1,3- (meta) substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two clean doublets. This is incorrect.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   **Result:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is a definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester: **-O-CH₂CH₃**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded), indicating they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded), indicating they are ortho to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\nBased on the combined analysis of all the data, the molecule consists of:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nPutting these fragments together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer where the ester linkage is Ar-O-CO-R. The methylene protons of the ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) would be adjacent to the carbonyl, not the oxygen, and would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, which contradicts the observed 4.5 ppm signal.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (not an ester) and is meta-substituted (not para). This contradicts the IR C=O frequency and the NMR aromatic splitting pattern.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two. It also lacks the primary amine protons in the NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectral data is unequivocally consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   **Result:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-) split by the adjacent three protons. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in their chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-donating amino group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nThe combined spectral data points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted primary amide. This is inconsistent with the NMR aromatic pattern (para) and the IR carbonyl frequency (ester, not amide).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a para-substituted ring.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of a propionate chain (-COCH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for the methylene (-CH₂-) group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only compound that is fully consistent with all the provided IR and ¹H NMR data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional pi bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This immediately rules out candidate D, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. This makes an ester (like A or C) more likely than an amide (like B or D), as amides typically absorb at a lower frequency (e.g., ~1680 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Aromatic Region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   This rules out candidate B, 3-ethoxybenzamide, which is 1,3-disubstituted (meta) and would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n*   **Alkyl/Functional Group Region:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This very downfield shift indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   Let's compare this to candidate A, 4-aminophenyl propionate. In that molecule, the ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl, and its chemical shift would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Therefore, candidate A is incorrect.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe combined spectral data points to a single structure:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's verify this against the provided options.\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR for the ethyl group does not match.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect.

Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This finding immediately makes option D, a secondary amide, unlikely.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a simple amide (like in option A), which usually appears below 1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3.

This strongly suggests an **ethyl ester** fragment. This evidence rules out option C (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the methylene quartet would be next to a carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The presence of two clean doublets, each for two protons, indicates para substitution. This rules out option A (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is meta-substituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   The chemical shifts indicate one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons to ~8.0 ppm). This is perfectly consistent with an electron-donating amine (-NH₂) and an electron-withdrawing ester (-COOEt) group in a para arrangement.\n\n**4.

Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This immediately casts doubt on any structure that is not a primary amine, such as option C (a secondary amide).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** functional group. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out option A, which is 1,3-disubstituted (meta).\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):**\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) together confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is crucial. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n### 4.

Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This finding makes options with secondary amines or amides less likely or allows for their elimination.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** functional group. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which typically appears below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains both a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This eliminates option A (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This very downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR analysis.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nThe combined spectral data points to a single structure composed of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group attached to the ring.\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the ring.\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. It is meta-substituted and is an amide, not an ester with a primary amine on the ring.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. It is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data showing a primary amine.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches every piece of data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and ester groups from the IR, and the para-substituted ring and ethyl ester fragment from the NMR.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. While it has a primary amine and a para-substituted ring, it is a phenyl propionate (Ar-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). The methylene (-CH₂-) protons of the ethyl group would be adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the data conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The calculation `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)` yields `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\nThe combined data points to a structure with the following components:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted primary amide. The IR and NMR aromatic patterns do not match.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this isomer, the methylene protons of the ethyl group would be adjacent to a carbonyl, giving a signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, contradicting the data.\n*   D) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure is perfectly consistent with all provided spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and ester groups in the IR, and the ethyl ester, primary amine, and para-substituted ring patterns in the ¹H NMR.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe overwhelming evidence from all spectroscopic data points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The majority of the provided candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis, even if some selected the wrong letter due to a different ordering of the options. Based on the options provided in the problem description, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This single piece of evidence allows us to eliminate any candidate that is not a primary amine.\n    *   **Eliminates D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide.\n    *   **Eliminates C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is a primary amide. The C=O stretch for an amide is typically lower (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to two protons, are the unmistakable pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   This confirms the elimination of **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This significant downfield shift indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   This allows us to distinguish between the remaining candidates A and B.\n    *   **Eliminates B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**. In this molecule, the ethyl group is part of a propionate fragment (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- group is adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and its signal would appear much further upfield, around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n*   The analysis systematically eliminates options B, C, and D.\n*   Only **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** is consistent with all pieces of spectral data. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, which perfectly match the IR and ¹H NMR spectra. The different chemical shifts of the aromatic protons (7.0 and 8.0 ppm) are also explained by the opposing electronic effects of the electron-donating amine group and the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\nThe vast majority of the provided answers, despite some having inconsistent lettering for the options, correctly identified the structure as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate through sound chemical reasoning.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which tells us the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`\n*   For C9H11NO2: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`\n*   A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This finding immediately makes options with secondary amides (like B) or primary amides (like D) less likely or incorrect, pending other data.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which would be closer to 1680 cm⁻¹).\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons. The quartet (q) is the methylene group (-CH₂-) split by the adjacent three protons. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is crucial; it indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar broadening from the nitrogen nucleus. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded) because they are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded) because they are adjacent to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nThe combined evidence points to a single structure:\n*   A **para-disubstituted benzene ring**...\n*   ...with a **primary amine (-NH₂) group** at one position...\n*   ...and an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group** at the other.\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two. It would also have a formyl proton signal in the NMR. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer where the ester linkage is reversed. The ethyl group would be part of a propionate chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (incorrect C=O frequency) and is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two clean doublets. Incorrect.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most of them correctly identify the structure through their reasoning, several have typographical errors in the final letter they output. The chemical reasoning across the board overwhelmingly supports ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided data and candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   For C9H11NO2, the DoU is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This is a crucial point that eliminates any structures that are not primary amines.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which would be <1700 cm⁻¹) and fits perfectly for an ester attached to a benzene ring.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is definitive for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This eliminates any structures with other substitution patterns (like meta or ortho).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The key detail is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene (-CH₂-) group appearing this far downfield indicates it is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's evaluate each option against the evidence gathered:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** A para-substituted benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Fit:** This structure perfectly matches every piece of data. It has a primary amine (IR, NMR at 4.0 ppm), a para-substituted ring (NMR at 7.0/8.0 ppm), and an ethyl ester group with the characteristic -O-CH₂- quartet at 4.5 ppm. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:**\n    *   **Structure:** An ester where the ethyl group is part of the acid portion (-OCOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Fit:** The methylene (-CH₂-) group is adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen. Its NMR signal would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. **This is inconsistent with the NMR data.**\n\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:**\n    *   **Structure:** A secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine.\n    *   **Fit:** This would only show one N-H band in the IR, not two. **This is inconsistent with the IR data.**\n\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:**\n    *   **Structure:** A 1,3- (meta) substituted ring.\n    *   **Fit:** The aromatic region of the NMR would show a more complex pattern, not two clean doublets. **This is inconsistent with the NMR data.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral data unequivocally points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The analysis provided by the majority of the agents correctly identifies the structure through chemical principles, even if some of them made a clerical error by selecting the wrong letter. The reasoning is sound and consistent: the compound must be a para-substituted primary amine with an ethyl ester functional group. Only option A fulfills all these requirements.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
