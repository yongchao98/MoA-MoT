    # --- Step 1: Define the core physical principles ---

    # Principle 1: The formula for the mean free path (MFP) of a gas molecule among its moving peers is:
    # λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)
    # The sqrt(2) factor accounts for the relative motion of all particles.

    # Principle 2: The formula for the MFP of a high-energy electron among (effectively) stationary gas molecules is:
    # λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)
    # The sqrt(2) factor is absent because the electron's velocity is vastly greater than the gas molecules' thermal velocity.

    # Principle 3: The key physical insight regarding collision cross-sections (σ).
    # For a very high-energy (1000 kV) electron, the target atom is highly transparent.
    # The scattering cross-section (σ_eg) is therefore significantly SMALLER than the
    # physical, kinetic cross-section of two molecules colliding (σ_gg).
    # This implies the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is greater than 1.
    sigma_ratio_is_greater_than_1 = True

    # --- Step 2: Derive the theoretical relationship between λ2 and λ1 ---

    # The ratio λ2 / λ1 is derived by dividing the two formulas:
    # λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]
    # λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)
    # λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)

    # --- Step 3: Formulate the final conclusion from the derivation ---

    # Since (σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1, the ratio (λ2 / λ1) must be greater than sqrt(2).
    derived_ratio_lower_bound = math.sqrt(2)
    # derived_conclusion: λ2 / λ1 > 1.414...

    # --- Step 4: Check the provided answer against the derived conclusion ---

    # The final answer provided is 'B'.
    final_answer_letter = 'B'

    # The options as listed in the final analysis block are:
    # A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  -->  1 < (λ2/λ1) < 1.22
    # B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1      -->  (λ2/λ1) >= 1.22
    # C) λ2 < λ1            -->  (λ2/λ1) < 1
    # D) λ2 = λ1            -->  (λ2/λ1) = 1

    # The chosen answer 'B' corresponds to the condition: λ2/λ1 >= 1.22
    answer_b_condition_lower_bound = 1.22

    # Verification: Is our derived conclusion (λ2/λ1 > 1.414) consistent with the chosen answer (λ2/λ1 >= 1.22)?
