Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying the most robust solution.

### Step-by-step Analysis

1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement**
    *   **Given Information:** "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵".
    *   **Fundamental Relationship:** The distance to a star (`r`) is inversely proportional to its parallax (`plx`). In standard units, `r = 1/plx`, which also means `plx = 1/r`.
    *   **Goal:** Determine how the number of stars changes "per unit range of distance, r". This is a request for the number density with respect to distance, which is mathematically expressed as the derivative `dN/dr`.

2.  **Address the Core Ambiguity: Interpreting "Varies With"**
    This is the most critical step, and the candidate answers diverge here. The phrase "the number of stars varies with parallax" can be interpreted in two ways:

    *   **Interpretation A (Cumulative Count):** This assumes the *total* number of stars (`N`) with a parallax greater than `plx` (i.e., all stars within a distance `r`) is proportional to `1/plx⁵`.
        *   Derivation: `N ∝ 1/plx⁵` -> `N ∝ r⁵` -> `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`.

    *   **Interpretation B (Differential Count / Density):** This assumes the number of stars *per unit interval of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁵`.
        *   Derivation: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`. To find `dN/dr`, we must transform the density function.

3.  **Select the Correct Interpretation**
    In physics and astronomy, when describing how a quantity is distributed as a function of a variable (e.g., a mass function, a luminosity function), the statement almost always refers to the **density function** (Interpretation B). The cumulative count is usually specified explicitly (e.g., "the total number of stars within distance r"). Therefore, Interpretation B is the standard, more physically sound approach. The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly identify this as the proper method.

4.  **Derivation using the Differential Interpretation**
    We start with the density in parallax space and transform it to distance space.

    *   **Start:** `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`
    *   **Transformation Rule:** To convert a density from one variable to another, we use the chain rule, multiplying by the absolute value of the derivative of the variable transformation (the Jacobian).
        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`
    *   **Calculate the Jacobian:** We need the derivative of `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.
        `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`
        The absolute value is `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.
    *   **Substitute and Solve:** Now, substitute the known parts into the transformation equation.
        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`
    *   **Express in terms of `r`:** The final step is to replace `plx` with `1/r` to get the relationship purely as a function of distance.
        `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`
        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`
        `dN/dr ∝ r³`

### Careful Points to Consider

*   **Interpretation is Key:** The most common point of error is misinterpreting the initial condition. Assuming `N ∝ 1/plx⁵` (cumulative) leads to `r⁴`, while the standard density interpretation `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵` correctly leads to `r³`.
*   **The Chain Rule and the Jacobian:** When transforming a density function, one must use the chain rule and include the Jacobian term (`|d(plx)/dr|`). Simply substituting `plx = 1/r` into the density function is incorrect.
*   **Algebraic Accuracy:** The rules of exponents must be applied correctly: `1/(1/r)⁵ = r⁵` and `r⁵ * 1/r² = r³`.
*   **Option Mapping:** Several candidate answers correctly derived `r³` but then selected the wrong multiple-choice letter due to inconsistent option lists. The final derived physical relationship must be carefully matched to the original options provided in the question.

### Conclusion

The most robust analysis, based on the standard scientific interpretation of the problem, shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r³`. Matching this result to the original options:

A) ~ r^5
B) ~ r^4
C) ~ r^2
D) ~ r^3

The correct option is D.
