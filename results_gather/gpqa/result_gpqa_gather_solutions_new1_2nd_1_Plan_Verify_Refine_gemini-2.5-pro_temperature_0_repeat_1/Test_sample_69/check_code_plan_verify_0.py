This is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances, particularly the hazardous product E, and then determine its molecular symmetry. The most robust solution is one that consistently satisfies all the given clues.

### Step-by-step Analysis

1.  **Analyze the Most Constraining Clues:** The stoichiometric ratios are the most specific and restrictive clues.
    *   **Clue 1:** `A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)`. The 1:8 ratio is a very strong hint. The most common solid element that exists as an octatomic molecule is sulfur (S₈). If we test **A = S₈** and **B = Cl₂** (chlorine gas), the reaction becomes `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂`. This perfectly matches the stoichiometry. The product, **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride), is a cherry-red liquid, which fits the "bright red product" description.
    *   **Clue 4:** `D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio. Using our identification of B = Cl₂, a common 1:1 reaction with a gas (D) to form a solvent (H) is the chlorination of ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`. This identifies **D = C₂H₄** (ethene) and **H = 1,2-dichloroethane**.

2.  **Verify with Remaining Clues:** We must check if these identities hold for the other two reactions.
    *   **Clue 3:** `C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`. The hydrolysis of our proposed C (SCl₂) is a known disproportionation reaction: `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S + SO₂ + 4HCl`. This reaction's products are:
        *   Elemental sulfur (**A**), which is a solid, thus reforming the starting material.
        *   Hydrochloric acid (**F = HCl**), a strong acid.
        *   Sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (**G = H₂SO₃**), a weak acid.
        This clue is perfectly satisfied.
    *   **Clue 2:** `C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)`. Substituting our identified compounds: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`. This is the exact equation for the Levinstein process, the primary industrial method for producing **mustard gas**. The product **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S** (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide) is an infamous chemical warfare agent, perfectly fitting the "extremely hazardous" description. The 1:2 stoichiometry is also correct.

3.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**
    *   Having confidently identified E as mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S, we can determine its molecular symmetry group.
    *   The molecule's structure is Cl-CH₂-CH₂-S-CH₂-CH₂-Cl.
    *   Due to the two lone pairs on the central sulfur atom, the C-S-C bond is bent. The molecule is not planar.
    *   In its most stable, lowest-energy conformation, the molecule lacks any mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i).
    *   The only symmetry element it possesses (other than the identity element E) is a single **two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) ** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.
    *   A molecule whose only symmetry element is a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.

4.  **Final Conclusion:** The chemical pathway leading to mustard gas is the only one that provides a complete and consistent solution for all clues. The product E is mustard gas, which has C₂ symmetry. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:
    *   A) D4h
    *   B) D∞h
    *   C) C2
    *   D) C2v

The correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.
