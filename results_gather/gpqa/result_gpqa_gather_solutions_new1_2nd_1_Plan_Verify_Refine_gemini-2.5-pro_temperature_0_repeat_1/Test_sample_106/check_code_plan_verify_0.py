    Checks the correctness of the answer for the drug discovery workflow question.

    The question asks for the MOST crucial step BEFORE in silico docking for a complex molecule.
    The logic is based on standard drug discovery workflows and risk mitigation.

    - A) Analyze all forms computationally and prioritize. (Good technical step, but predictive)
    - B) Focus on ADME/pharmacokinetics. (Wrong sequence)
    - C) Use only the most stable form. (Flawed assumption)
    - D) Combine in silico predictions with preliminary in vitro binding assays. (Best strategic step - de-risking)

This approach is entirely predictive and carries the significant risk that the computational models do not reflect reality. The most crucial step is to mitigate this primary risk. Option D is superior because it incorporates experimental validation (in vitro assays) to provide a 'reality check' before committing extensive resources.",
        'B': "Incorrect. Option B is incorrect because it describes a step that is out of sequence in the drug discovery pipeline. ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) studies are performed on lead compounds *after* they have been shown to bind effectively to the target. The purpose of the initial docking study is to establish this binding potential first.",
        'C': "Incorrect. Option C is incorrect because it is based on a flawed and risky scientific assumption. The most thermodynamically stable form of a molecule in isolation is often *not* the biologically active form. The specific environment of the protein's binding pocket can stabilize a higher-energy conformer or tautomer, which would be missed by this approach."
