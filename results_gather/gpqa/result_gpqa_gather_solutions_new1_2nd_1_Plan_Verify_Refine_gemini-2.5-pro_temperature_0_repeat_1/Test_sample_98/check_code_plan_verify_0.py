    This problem requires a rigorous, step-by-step analysis of spectroscopic data to distinguish between four structural isomers. The most common pitfall, as seen in the candidate answers, is correctly identifying the molecule but incorrectly matching it to the lettered option from the question.

    ### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**

    **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**
    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is the classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.
    *   A strong absorption peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, also from a carboxylic acid.
    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.

    **2. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**
    The key to solving the problem lies in the two highly specific splitting patterns. The molecule must contain protons that exhibit *both* patterns.
    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern arises from a single proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:
        *   One neighboring proton (causes the **d**oublet).
        *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (causes the **t**riplet).
        *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (causes the **q**uartet).
    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises from a different proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:
        *   One neighboring proton (causes the **d**oublet).
        *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (causes the first **t**riplet).
        *   Another, chemically distinct set of two equivalent neighboring protons (causes the second **t**riplet).

    **3. Unambiguously Identify the Candidate Structures**
    A critical step is to correctly interpret the condensed formulas for each option. Let's name them systematically (COOH is C1).
    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** This is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.
    *   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** This is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.
    *   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** This is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.
    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** This is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.

    **4. Systematically Evaluate Each Structure**
    We must find the single structure that contains protons matching both the `dtq` and `dtt` descriptions. We will focus on the methine (CH) protons.

    *   **A) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid:** The proton at C3 has neighbors: H at C2 (1H), CH₂ at C4 (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). This gives a **dtq**. However, the structure lacks a proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) needed for a `dtt`.
    *   **B) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid:** The proton at C3 has neighbors: H at C2 (1H), CH₂ at C4 (2H), and a CH₂ from its ethyl group (2H). This gives a **dtt**. However, the structure lacks a proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) needed for a `dtq`.
    *   **C) 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid:** The proton at C3 has neighbors: CH₂ at C2 (2H), H at C4 (1H), and a CH₃ group (3H). This gives a **dtq**. However, the structure lacks a proton environment that would create a `dtt`.
    *   **D) 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid:** Let's analyze the two central methine protons.
        ```
              Et      Et
              |       |
           CH₃-CH(b) - CH(a) - CH₂ - COOH
        ```
        *   **Proton H(a) at C3:** This proton is coupled to the proton at C4 (H(b), 1H), the CH₂ group in the main chain (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group at C3 (2H). The neighbors are 1H, 2H, and another 2H. This combination produces a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one required signal.
        *   **Proton H(b) at C4:** This proton is coupled to the proton at C3 (H(a), 1H), the terminal CH₃ group (3H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group at C4 (2H). The neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This combination produces a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second required signal.

    ### **Final Conclusion**

    The analysis confirms that only structure **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid) has the necessary arrangement of protons to produce both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum. It is the only candidate consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.
