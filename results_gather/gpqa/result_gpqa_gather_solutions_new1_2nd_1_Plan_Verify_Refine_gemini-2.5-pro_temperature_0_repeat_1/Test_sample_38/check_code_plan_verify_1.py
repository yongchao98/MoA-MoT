    The analysis and calculation are complete and have been verified as correct.

    The core principle is the normalization of the wave function, which states that the integral of the probability density, |ψ(x)|², over the allowed region must equal 1.

    1.  **Probability Density**: For ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, the probability density is |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.
    2.  **Normalization Integral**: The problem states the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3.
        ∫[from 1 to 3] (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = 1
    3.  **Solving the Integral**:
        [a² * ln(1+x) + 0.25x] from 1 to 3 = 1
        (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1
        a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1
        a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
    4.  **Solving for 'a'**:
        a² * ln(2) = 0.5
        a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))
    5.  **Numerical Value**: The calculation yields a ≈ 0.8493.
    6.  **Conclusion**: Comparing the calculated value to the options provided in the prompt:
        A) 0.6
        B) 0.35
        C) 1.1
        D) 0.85
    The value 0.8493 is closest to 0.85, which is option D.
