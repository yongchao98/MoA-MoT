    # 1. Analyze Reaction 1: A + H2SO4 ---> 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one
    # The product is a cyclohexanone (a 6-membered ring).
    # In a Pinacol rearrangement, this product is formed via ring expansion from a smaller ring.
    # Therefore, the starting material 'A' must be a cyclopentanol derivative (a 5-membered ring).
    # A starting material with a cyclohexane ring would expand to a 7-membered ring (cycloheptanone).
    correct_A_ring_type = "cyclopentan"
    
    # 2. Analyze Reaction 2: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 ---> B
    # The starting material is CH3-CH(OH)-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.
    # Step a: Carbocation formation. The carbocation will form at the most stable position.
    # The C2 position is tertiary and benzylic, making it far more stable than the secondary C3 position.
    # Step b: 1,2-shift. With the carbocation at C2, a group from C3 migrates.
    # The groups on C3 are a hydrogen (H) and a methyl group (CH3).
    # Migratory aptitude is H > CH3. Therefore, a 1,2-hydride shift occurs.
    # Step c: Product formation. The hydride shift results in a ketone at C3.
    # The resulting product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.
    # A methyl shift would incorrectly yield methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.
    correct_B_name = "methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate"
