    # --- Step-by-step chemical analysis to determine the correct product ---

    # Step 1: Protection of alcohol. Stereochemistry at C4 is preserved as (S).
    # Product 1: (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

    # Step 2: Conjugate addition of Phenyl, then alkylation with Benzyl.
    # Phenyl adds anti to the bulky C4-OTBS group. C4(S) -> C3(R).
    # Benzyl adds anti to the bulky C3-Phenyl group. C3(R) -> C2(S).
    # Product 2 stereochemistry: (2S, 3R, 4S).

    # Step 3: Methylation with LDA/CH3I.
    # Regiochemistry: LDA is a bulky base, forming the kinetic enolate.
    # The C2 carbon is quaternary (no protons) after step 2.
    # Therefore, deprotonation and methylation MUST occur at C6.
    # Stereochemistry: The bulky groups on the ring direct the methyl group, resulting in C6(S).
    # Product 3 stereochemistry: (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S).

    # Step 4: Deprotection.
    # The TBS group is removed, regenerating the -OH group. Stereochemistry is unaffected.
