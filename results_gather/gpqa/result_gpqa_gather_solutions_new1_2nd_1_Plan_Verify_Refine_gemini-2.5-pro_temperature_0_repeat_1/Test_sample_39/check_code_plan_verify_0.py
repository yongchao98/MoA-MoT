    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the chemistry jargon question.

    This function simulates the reasoning process an expert would use by:
    1. Defining the problem context and options.
    2. Using a knowledge base to map lab jargon to scientific techniques and principles.
    3. Logically deriving the correct answer based on the knowledge base.
    4. Comparing the derived answer to the provided final answer.
