    # Step 3: Shapiro Reaction

    # CRITICAL: n-BuLi acts as a BASE, not a nucleophile. No butyl group is added.

    # 1. Hydrogenation: All C=C double bonds are reduced to C-C single bonds.
    #    (isopropenyl -> isopropyl; cyclohexene -> cyclohexane)
    # 2. Hydrogenolysis: The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved, regenerating the alcohol.
