def check_correctness_of_astro_problem():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the parallax problem.

    The problem asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/d(plx))
    and the parallax (plx), assuming a uniform star distribution.

    The derivation is as follows:
    1. The number of stars dN in a thin spherical shell of radius d and thickness dd is
       proportional to the volume of the shell: dN ∝ d² dd.
       This means the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dd, is proportional to d².
    2. The relationship between distance and parallax is d = 1/plx.
    3. We want to find dN/d(plx). Using the chain rule: dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * |dd/d(plx)|.
    4. We calculate dd/d(plx) by differentiating d = 1/plx, which gives -1/plx². The magnitude is 1/plx².
    5. Substituting everything: dN/d(plx) ∝ d² * (1/plx²)
    6. Finally, substituting d = 1/plx: dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) = 1/plx⁴.
