def check_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the multi-step synthesis problem.

    The verification proceeds in two steps:
    1.  Check the stereochemistry of the ester groups. The starting material,
        maleic anhydride, is a cis-dienophile, so the final product must have
        cis-ester groups. This is a hard constraint.
    2.  Check the relative orientation of the bridges. The major product is
        formed via an anti-addition of cyclopentadiene due to sterics. This
        distinguishes between the remaining cis-isomers.
