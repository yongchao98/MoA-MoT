Analyze the constraints of the problem.**\nThe task is to identify the correct reagents, A and B, for two separate chemical reactions from a list of four options.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n*   **Reaction 2:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n\n**2. Apply the first constraint: Reaction 1.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a cyanohydrin formation. A ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with a cyanide source (NaCN) to form a cyanohydrin.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two steps. First, the nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. Second, this intermediate must be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be the source of protons (H⁺) for the second step.\n*   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n    *   `H3O+`: This represents an aqueous acid, which is an excellent source of protons. It is the standard choice for this protonation step (often as an acidic workup).\n    *   `NaHSO3`: This is sodium bisulfite. It is used in a different type of carbonyl addition reaction to form bisulfite adducts, which are crystalline solids often used for purification. It is not the correct reagent for forming a cyanohydrin.\n*   **Pruning:** Since A must be `H3O+`, we can eliminate any options where A is `NaHSO3`. This prunes options C and D. We are left with options A and B.\n\n**3. Apply the second constraint: Reaction 2.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a nitrile hydrolysis.\n*   **Mechanism:** This transformation requires a catalyst and water, typically with heating. It can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base.\n*   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B is the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n*   **Evaluating Options for B (from remaining choices A and B):**\n    *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and highly effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   `CH3COOH` (Acetic acid): This is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile, which requires vigorous conditions.\n*   **Pruning:** Since a strong acid is required, `HCl` is the correct choice for reagent B. This eliminates option A, which uses the weak acid `CH3COOH`.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion.**\n*   Constraint 1 requires A = `H3O+`.\n*   Constraint 2 requires B = `HCl`.\n*   The only option that satisfies both constraints is B.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents correctly identified the chemical principles (A=H3O+, B=HCl), several made errors in mapping this conclusion to the correct letter option.
