    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to a conceptual question about parallel algorithms
    for solving heat equations.

    The question asks for the "key factor" that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one
    in the context of using fractional approximations for the matrix exponential.

    The code models the logical deduction process by:
    1. Defining the properties of each option based on numerical analysis principles.
    2. Establishing constraints based on the question's requirements ("key factor for conversion").
    3. Applying these constraints to prune incorrect options.
    4. Comparing the result of the deduction with the provided answer.
