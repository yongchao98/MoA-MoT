    # Step 1: Derive the threshold energy formula.
    # The threshold condition for pair production (gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-)
    # from a head-on collision is E_gamma = (m_e*c^2)^2 / E_CMB.
    # This formula is consistently and correctly derived in the candidate answers.

    # Step 2: Ensure consistent units for the calculation. Convert MeV to eV.
    # 1 MeV = 1,000,000 eV
    m_e_c2_eV = m_e_c2_MeV * 1e6

    # Step 3: Calculate the threshold energy in eV.
