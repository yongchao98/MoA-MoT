    Checks the correctness of the answer for the Stork enamine alkylation question.

    The function verifies two key chemical principles:
    1. The choice of the favorable acid catalyst for enamine formation.
    2. The identity of the final product after the H3O+ workup step.

    # --- Define Chemical Principles (Constraints) ---

    # Constraint 1: Favorable Catalyst
    # For enamine formation, a strong mineral acid like HCl is unfavorable as it
    # fully protonates the amine nucleophile. A bulky organic acid like p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH)
    # is the standard, favorable catalyst.

    # Constraint 2: Final Product
    # The reaction includes a final H3O+ workup. This hydrolyzes the iminium salt
    # intermediate to regenerate the ketone. Therefore, the final product is the
    # dicarbonyl compound, not the iminium salt.
