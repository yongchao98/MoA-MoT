def check_correctness():
    """
    This function programmatically checks the logic of the multi-step chemistry problem.

    1.  **Identify Starting Material**: It confirms that the starting material, based on the formula and NMR data, is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.
    2.  **Trace Reaction 1 & 2**: It applies the rule for diazotization followed by hydrolysis, which converts an aromatic amine to a phenol, to identify the first intermediate.
    3.  **Trace Reaction 3**: It applies the rule for an aldol reaction under heat. It critically distinguishes between the aldol *addition* product (a beta-hydroxy aldehyde) and the final aldol *condensation* product (an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde), which is expected due to the "Heat" condition.
    4.  **Verify Final Answer**: It compares the logically derived final product with the product corresponding to the given answer choice ('A').
