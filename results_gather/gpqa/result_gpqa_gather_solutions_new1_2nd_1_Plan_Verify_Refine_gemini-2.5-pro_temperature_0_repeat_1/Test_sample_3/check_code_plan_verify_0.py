    # The existence of magnetic monopoles would require two of Maxwell's equations to be modified:
    # 1. Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0) would change to include a magnetic charge density term.
    #    This corresponds to a change in the "divergence of the magnetic field".
    # 2. Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t) would change to include a magnetic current term,
    #    to maintain symmetry with the Ampere-Maxwell law.
    #    This corresponds to a change in the "circulation of the electric field".
    # Note: "curl" is synonymous with "circulation".
