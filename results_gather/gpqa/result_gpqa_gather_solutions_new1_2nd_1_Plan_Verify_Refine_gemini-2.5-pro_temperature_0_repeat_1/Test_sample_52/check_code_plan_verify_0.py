    # "Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring" -> C6H4 fragment
    # "FTIR ... ester group" -> -COO- fragment (2 Oxygens)
    # "1H NMR ... two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)" -> This is a classic signature for a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3. This fragment is C3H5.
    # "1H NMR ... two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups" -> One CH3 is in the propenyl group. The other must be in the ester.
    # "1H NMR ... no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups" -> This is a critical constraint. It confirms the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) to account for the second CH3 without adding a CH2.
