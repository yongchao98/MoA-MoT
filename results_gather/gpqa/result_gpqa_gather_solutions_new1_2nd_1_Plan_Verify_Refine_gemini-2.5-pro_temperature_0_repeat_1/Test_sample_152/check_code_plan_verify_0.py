    # --- Correctness Analysis based on Chemical Principles ---

    # 1. Analysis of Reaction A
    # Donor: enolate of dimethyl malonate (-CH(COOMe)2)
    # Acceptor: methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (p-tolyl-CH(beta)=CH(alpha)-COOMe)
    # The nucleophile attacks the beta-carbon, which bears the p-tolyl group.
    # The resulting propane backbone is C(malonate)-C(beta)-C(alpha).
    # Numbering: C1(H(COOMe)2) - C2(H(p-tolyl)) - C3(H2COOMe)
    # Correct Name A: The p-tolyl group is at position 2.
    correct_A = "trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate"

    # 2. Analysis of Reaction B
    # This is a Stork enamine synthesis. The enamine attacks the Michael acceptor.
    # The acidic workup (H3O+) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt back to a ketone.
    # For simple ketones, the keto-enol equilibrium strongly favors the thermodynamically stable keto form.
    # Correct Name B: The product is the keto form, not the enol form.
    correct_B = "3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile"

    # 3. Analysis of Reaction C (Retrosynthesis)
    # Product: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
    # The (3-oxobutyl) group comes from the acceptor, but-3-en-2-one.
    # The rest of the molecule, cyclohexane-1,3-dione, must be the donor (Reactant C).
    # The starting material is the stable dione. The enol form is not the correct reactant.
    correct_C = "cyclohexane-1,3-dione"
