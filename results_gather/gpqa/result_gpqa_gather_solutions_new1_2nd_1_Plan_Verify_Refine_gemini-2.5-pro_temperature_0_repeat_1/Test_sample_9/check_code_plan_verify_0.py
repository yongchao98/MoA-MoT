    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer about exoplanet density.

    The logic follows these steps:
    1.  **Model the Physics**: It establishes the relative densities of the four planets based on the provided descriptions and the principle of gravitational compression. For planets of the same composition, higher mass leads to higher density.
    2.  **Determine Correct Planet**: It identifies which planet description (a, b, c, or d) corresponds to the highest density.
    3.  **Define the Mapping**: It uses the mapping provided in the question (A->b, B->d, C->a, D->c) to link the final answer choices to the planet descriptions.
    4.  **Verify the Answer**: It checks if the provided final answer ('D') correctly points to the densest planet according to the mapping.
