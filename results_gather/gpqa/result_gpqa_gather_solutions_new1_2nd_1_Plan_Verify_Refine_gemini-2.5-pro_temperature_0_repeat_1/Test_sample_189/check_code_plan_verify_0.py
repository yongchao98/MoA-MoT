def check_nucleophile_ranking():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the nucleophile ranking based on chemical principles.

    The principles for nucleophilicity in a polar protic solvent (like water) are:
    1.  Charge: Anions > Neutral molecules.
    2.  Atom/Polarizability: Nucleophilicity increases down a group (S > O).
    3.  Resonance: Localized charge > Delocalized (resonance-stabilized) charge.
    4.  Steric Hindrance: Less hindered > More hindered.
