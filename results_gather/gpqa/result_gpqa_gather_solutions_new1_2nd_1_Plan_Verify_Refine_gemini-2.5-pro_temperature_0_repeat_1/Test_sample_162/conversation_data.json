The core principle is that the total moles of acid added must equal the sum of the moles needed for the stoichiometric reaction plus the moles of excess acid required to establish the final pH.\n\n1.  **Hypotheses (The Options):**\n    *   A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n    *   B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n    *   C) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n    *   D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n\n2.  **Constraint Application (Filtering):**\n    *   **Stoichiometric Requirement:** First, we calculate the minimum acid needed just for the reaction: Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O.\n        *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol.\n        *   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 × 0.000936 mol ≈ 0.002808 mol.\n        *   Volume of 0.1 M acid for reaction = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 M = 28.08 cm³.\n    *   **Pruning:** Any option with a volume less than 28.08 cm³ is impossible, as it wouldn't even dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃.\n        *   **Hypothesis A (20.40 cm³) is eliminated.**\n        *   **Hypothesis D (28.05 cm³) is eliminated.** (It's slightly less than the required amount).\n    *   **Consistency Check on Survivors:** We check if the remaining options (B and C) are self-consistent.\n        *   **Hypothesis C (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³):**\n            *   Total H⁺ added = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = 0.003009 mol.\n            *   Excess H⁺ = 0.003009 mol (total) - 0.002808 mol (reaction) = 0.000201 mol.\n            *   [H⁺] in final 100 cm³ solution = 0.000201 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00201 M.\n            *   Calculated pH = -log(0.00201) ≈ 2.70.\n            *   This calculated pH (2.70) is an excellent match for the given pH (2.69). **Hypothesis C is consistent.**\n        *   **Hypothesis B (pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³):**\n            *   Total H⁺ added = 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = 0.003214 mol.\n            *   Excess H⁺ = 0.003214 mol (total) - 0.002808 mol (reaction) = 0.000406 mol.\n            *   [H⁺] in final 100 cm³ solution = 0.000406 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00406 M.\n            *   Calculated pH = -log(0.00406) ≈ 2.39.\n            *   This calculated pH (2.39) does not match the given pH (3.16). **Hypothesis B is inconsistent.**\n\n3.  **Final Choice:**\n    Only hypothesis C survives the filtering process. It is the only option where the provided volume and pH are chemically consistent with each other.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Foundational Calculations\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, that need to be dissolved.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n    *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n    *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Total Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = **0.0009357 mol**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Requirements\n\nThe dissolution process involves two key requirements for the added strong acid (H⁺):\n\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction:** The acid must neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ base. The balanced equation is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    Based on the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ needed for this reaction are:\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = **0.002807 mol**\n\n2.  **Maintaining Final pH:** After the reaction, some excess H⁺ must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to keep it acidic and ensure the Fe(OH)₃ does not re-precipitate. The amount of excess H⁺ determines the final pH.\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ that must be added is the sum of these two amounts:\n**Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (remaining for pH)**\n\n### Step 3: Test the Options for Self-Consistency\n\nSince this is a multiple-choice question, the most reliable method is to check which of the given options is arithmetically self-consistent based on the principles from Step 2.\n\n#### Option A: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   Moles H⁺ (remaining for pH) = [H⁺] × Volume = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L = 0.000069 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = 0.002876 mol\n*   Calculated Volume of 0.1 M acid = 0.002876 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02876 L = 28.76 cm³\n*   This **does not match** the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\n#### Option B: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n*   Volume of 0.1 M acid needed for the reaction alone is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 28.07 cm³.\n*   The given volume (20.40 cm³) is **insufficient** to even dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃. This option is impossible.\n\n#### Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   Moles H⁺ (remaining for pH) = [H⁺] × Volume = (10⁻².⁰⁴ M) × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.000912 mol = 0.003719 mol\n*   Calculated Volume of 0.1 M acid = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³\n*   This **does not match** the given volume of 28.05 cm³.\n\n#### Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n*   Moles H⁺ (remaining for pH) = [H⁺] × Volume = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**\n*   Calculated Volume of 0.1 M acid = 0.003011 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03011 L = **30.11 cm³**\n*   This calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an **excellent match** for the given volume of 30.09 cm³.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   The analysis shows that only Option D provides a set of values where the volume of acid is consistent with the amount needed to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH.\n*   This calculation relies on a common simplifying assumption in such problems: that the final pH is determined by the excess strong acid, and the contribution from the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ product is considered negligible for the purpose of the calculation. While Fe³⁺ does hydrolyze to produce more H⁺, the self-consistency of the numbers in Option D strongly suggests this was the intended method of solution.\n*   Other options are either physically impossible (Option B) or arithmetically inconsistent (Options A and C).\n\nTherefore, Option D is the only chemically and mathematically consistent choice under the likely assumptions of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the volume of acid and the final pH are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other. The process involves calculating the amount of acid needed for two purposes:\n1.  To react stoichiometrically with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  To remain as excess H⁺ in the 100 cm³ solution to establish the final pH.\n\n**Step 1: Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol (Fe: 55.85, O: 16.00, H: 1.01).\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Acid Required for Stoichiometric Reaction**\nThe dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\nFrom the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ needed to react completely are:\n*   Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Consistency Check of the Options**\nNow, we test each option to see if the given volume of acid is sufficient to both complete the reaction and establish the given pH. The total moles of H⁺ required can be calculated as:\nTotal Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (for final pH)\nTotal Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + ([H⁺]final × 0.1 L)\nThe required volume is then: Volume = Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M.\n\n*   **Option A (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³):**\n    *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.00912 M.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (for pH) = 0.00912 M × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\n    *   Required Volume = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\n    *   This does not match the given volume of 28.05 cm³.\n\n*   **Option B (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³):**\n    *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.00204 M.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (for pH) = 0.00204 M × 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = 0.003011 mol.\n    *   Required Volume = 0.003011 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03011 L = 30.11 cm³.\n    *   This calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the given volume of 30.09 cm³.\n\n*   **Option C (pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³):**\n    *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M ≈ 0.00069 M.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (for pH) = 0.00069 M × 0.1 L = 0.000069 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n    *   Required Volume = 0.002876 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02876 L = 28.76 cm³.\n    *   This does not match the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\n*   **Option D (pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³):**\n    *   The volume of acid needed just for the reaction is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 28.07 cm³. The given volume of 20.40 cm³ is insufficient to even dissolve the solid.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only option where the provided pH and volume are consistent with the chemical principles is Option B. The volume of 30.09 cm³ is almost exactly the amount required to neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to yield a pH of 2.69 in the final 100 cm³ solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid is consistent with the amount needed to both dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH. This requires a step-by-step analysis.\n\n**Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   First, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar Mass = (Molar Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Molar Mass of O + Molar Mass of H)\n    *   Molar Mass ≈ 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Next, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the acid required for the reaction (Stoichiometry):**\n    *   The chemical reaction for dissolution in a strong acid is:\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    *   The stoichiometry shows that 3 moles of H⁺ are required for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine the acid required to maintain the final pH (Excess Acid):**\n    *   The total acid added must not only react with the Fe(OH)₃ but also leave some excess H⁺ ions in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution to maintain the final acidic pH.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (excess) = Final [H⁺] × Total Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L.\n\n4.  **Test each option for consistency:**\n    *   The correct option must satisfy the following equation:\n        **Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Moles for Reaction + Moles for pH**\n    *   Where \"Total Moles of H⁺ Added\" is calculated from the volume given in the option (Volume × 0.1 M).\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   **A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = 0.002040 mol.\n    *   This is less than the 0.002807 mol required just for the reaction. Therefore, this volume is insufficient to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = 0.003009 mol.\n    *   Moles H⁺ for pH = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol.\n    *   Let's check the balance: Moles for Reaction + Moles for pH = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = 0.003011 mol.\n    *   This calculated total (0.003011 mol) is an excellent match for the actual amount of acid added (0.003009 mol). **Option B is self-consistent.**\n\n*   **C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n    *   This amount is almost exactly the amount needed for the reaction (0.002807 mol), leaving virtually no excess acid.\n    *   However, to achieve a pH of 2.04, a significant amount of excess acid is needed: Moles H⁺ for pH = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000912 mol.\n    *   The volume provided is insufficient to both react and establish this pH. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = 0.003214 mol.\n    *   Moles H⁺ for pH = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol.\n    *   Let's check the balance: Moles for Reaction + Moles for pH = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n    *   This calculated total (0.002876 mol) does not match the amount of acid added (0.003214 mol). **Option D is incorrect.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Option B provides a volume of acid and a final pH that are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Chemical Processes**\n\n1.  **Dissolution Reaction:** Solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, is a base. To dissolve it, we must add a strong acid (H⁺). The neutralization reaction is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This shows a 1:3 molar ratio between Fe(OH)₃ and H⁺.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium:** The total amount of acid added must be sufficient for two purposes:\n    a.  To react stoichiometrically with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n    b.  To leave a certain amount of excess H⁺ in the final solution. This excess H⁺ keeps the pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe correct answer must be a self-consistent pair of (pH, Volume) values that satisfies both of these conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\nNext, calculate the moles of H⁺ needed just for the reaction (stoichiometric amount).\n*   Moles of H⁺ (for reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Consistency Check on the Options**\n\nThe most reliable method is to test each option to see if the given volume of acid is exactly what's needed to (a) react with the Fe(OH)₃ and (b) establish the given pH in the final 100 cm³ solution.\n\nLet's test **Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ added** from the given volume:\n    *   Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ (added) = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of excess H⁺ remaining** in the solution to create the given pH:\n    *   Final [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   Final Solution Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] × Volume = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ that must have reacted:**\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = Total Moles H⁺ (added) - Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 0.003009 mol - 0.0002042 mol = **0.0028048 mol**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the stoichiometric requirement:**\n    *   The calculated moles of H⁺ that reacted (0.0028048 mol) is an almost perfect match for the stoichiometric amount we calculated in Step 2 (0.002807 mol). The tiny difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding.\n\nThis shows that Option C is internally consistent.\n\n**Step 4: Check Other Options (for completeness)**\n\n*   **Option D (20.40 cm³):** This volume provides only 0.00204 mol of H⁺, which is less than the 0.002807 mol needed just to react with the Fe(OH)₃. Therefore, the solid would not fully dissolve. This option is invalid.\n*   **Option A (28.05 cm³):** This volume provides 0.002805 mol of H⁺, which is almost exactly the stoichiometric amount. This leaves virtually no excess acid. The pH would then be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺, which results in a pH of about 2.3, not 2.04. Thus, this option is inconsistent.\n*   **Option B (32.14 cm³):** A similar consistency check shows a significant mismatch between the required and calculated amounts.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only option where the volume of acid and the final pH are chemically consistent with each other is Option C. The 30.09 cm³ of acid is the precise amount needed to both neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave enough excess H⁺ to lower the pH of the 100 cm³ solution to 2.69.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Foundational Calculations**\n\nFirst, we must determine the number of moles of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, to be dissolved.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:\n    *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n    *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n    *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Total Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**\n*   The number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ is:\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009357 mol**\n\n**2. The Chemical Reaction and Acid Requirement**\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid is a neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ ions from the strong acid serves two purposes:\n*   **Part 1 (Reaction):** An amount of H⁺ is consumed to react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Part 2 (Excess):** An additional amount of H⁺ must remain in the solution to establish the final acidic pH, which ensures the Fe(OH)₃ stays dissolved.\n\n**3. Consistency Check of the Options**\n\nThe correct option must be chemically and mathematically self-consistent. We can test each option by calculating the total moles of H⁺ required (Part 1 + Part 2) and seeing if it matches the moles of H⁺ supplied by the given volume of acid.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction (Part 1):**\n    Based on the stoichiometry (3 moles of H⁺ per mole of Fe(OH)₃):\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = **0.002807 mol**\n\nNow, we test each option:\n\n**A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ supplied:** Volume × Molarity = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for final pH (Part 2):** [H⁺] × Volume = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol\n*   **Total H⁺ needed (Part 1 + Part 2):** 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** The moles supplied (0.003009) and the moles needed (0.003011) are an excellent match.

The volume of acid provided (30.09 cm³) is sufficient to both neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to produce a final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Chemical Processes**\n\nTwo main chemical processes are involved:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** A strong acid (H⁺) is used to neutralize and dissolve the solid base, Fe(OH)₃. The balanced equation is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Final Solution State:** The total amount of acid added must be sufficient for two purposes:\n    a.

Initial Calculations**\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    M(Fe(OH)₃) = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction (Task a):**\n    From the 1:3 stoichiometry, Moles H⁺ = 3 × Moles Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.0028073 mol**.\n\n**3. Testing the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nWe will now test each option to see if the numbers work out. The total moles of H⁺ required is the sum of the moles for the reaction and the moles needed to establish the final pH.\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (for pH)**\n*   **Moles H⁺ (for pH) = [H⁺]final × Total Volume = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L**\n*   **Required Volume = Total Moles H⁺ / Acid Concentration**\n\nLet's check each option:\n\n**A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   Moles of H⁺ supplied = 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = 0.002040 mol.\n*   This is less than the 0.0028073 mol required just for the reaction. The Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve.\n*   **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   Moles H⁺ (for pH) = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.0002042 mol.\n*   Total Moles H⁺ required = 0.0028073 mol (reaction) + 0.0002042 mol (for pH) = **0.0030115 mol**.\n*   Calculated Volume required = 0.0030115 mol / 0.1 M = 0.030115 L = **30.12 cm³**.\n*   This calculated volume (30.12 cm³) is an excellent match for the given volume (30.09 cm³). The minor difference is due to rounding.\n*   **Conclusion: Option B is self-consistent and highly plausible.**\n\n**C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   Moles H⁺ (for pH) = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.0009120 mol.\n*   Total Moles H⁺ required = 0.0028073 mol (reaction) + 0.0009120 mol (for pH) = **0.0037193 mol**.\n*   Calculated Volume required = 0.0037193 mol / 0.1 M = 0.037193 L = **37.19 cm³**.\n*   This calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the given volume (28.05 cm³). The given volume is insufficient.\n*   **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   Moles H⁺ (for pH) = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.0000692 mol.\n*   Total Moles H⁺ required = 0.0028073 mol (reaction) + 0.0000692 mol (for pH) = **0.0028765 mol**.\n*   Calculated Volume required = 0.0028765 mol / 0.1 M = 0.028765 L = **28.77 cm³**.\n*   This calculated volume (28.77 cm³) does not match the given volume (32.14 cm³).\n*   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that only Option B provides a pair of pH and volume values that are chemically and mathematically consistent with the conditions of the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles in 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is: 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n**2. Understand the Acid Requirement**\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid is a neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the strong acid must serve two purposes:\n*   **Part 1 (Reaction):** React stoichiometrically with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Part 2 (Excess):** Remain in the 100 cm³ solution to create the final acidic pH.\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ for the Reaction (Part 1)**\n\nFrom the reaction's stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × 0.00093575 mol = 0.00280725 mol.\n\n**4. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nThe correct option must provide a volume of acid that supplies enough H⁺ for both Part 1 and Part 2. We can test each option to see if the numbers are consistent.\n\n**Let's test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:**\n    The volume of the 0.1 M acid is 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L).\n    Total Moles H⁺ = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Required (Calculated):**\n    *   Part 1 (Reaction): We already calculated this as **0.00280725 mol**.\n    *   Part 2 (Excess for pH): The final pH is 2.69. The concentration of H⁺ needed is [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M. In a 100 cm³ (0.1 L) volume, the moles of excess H⁺ are:\n      Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n    *   Total Required Moles = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (excess)\n      Total Required Moles = 0.00280725 + 0.0002042 = **0.00301145 mol**.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    The total moles of H⁺ added from the given volume (0.003009 mol) is an excellent match for the total moles required to perform the reaction and establish the given pH (0.003011 mol). The difference is negligible (~0.08%).\n\n**Let's briefly check another option:**\n\n**Test Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:**\n    Total Moles H⁺ = 0.1 mol/L × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   **Comparison:**\n    The amount of acid added (0.002805 mol) is less than the amount required just for the stoichiometric reaction (0.002807 mol). This volume is insufficient to dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃, let alone create an even more acidic pH of 2.04. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A is the only choice where the provided volume of acid and the resulting pH are chemically and mathematically consistent. The amount of acid is sufficient to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to achieve the specified pH.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires finding a self-consistent pair of values: the volume of acid needed and the resulting pH. There are two main components to the acid's role:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction:** A certain amount of acid is consumed to neutralize and dissolve the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Final pH:** An excess amount of acid must remain in the solution to keep it acidic enough for the Fe(OH)₃ to stay dissolved. The final pH is determined by the concentration of this excess H⁺.\n\nThe most robust method to solve this is to test each multiple-choice option for self-consistency. We can take the pH from an option, calculate the total amount of acid that would be required to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and achieve that pH, and then see if the resulting volume matches the volume given in that same option.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 0.0009356 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of H⁺ for Stoichiometric Reaction:**\n    The reaction is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ needed for reaction = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009356 mol = **0.002807 mol**.\n\n3.  **Test Option D (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³):**\n    This option proposes that the final pH is 2.69. Let's calculate the total acid needed to achieve this.\n    *   **Moles of H⁺ to maintain pH:** The excess H⁺ in the solution determines the final pH.\n        *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n        *   Moles of excess H⁺ = Concentration × Volume = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n    *   **Total Moles of H⁺ Required:** This is the sum of the acid for the reaction and the excess acid for the pH.\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol (for reaction) + 0.0002042 mol (for pH) = **0.0030112 mol**.\n    *   **Calculate Required Volume of Acid:** The acid is 0.1 M.\n        *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n        *   Volume in cm³ = 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is an excellent match for the volume given in Option D (30.09 cm³). The minor difference is due to rounding of constants. No other option demonstrates this level of self-consistency. For example, options B and C provide insufficient acid to even complete the stoichiometric reaction (28.05 cm³ and 20.40 cm³ are both less than the required ~28.07 cm³ plus any excess). Therefore, Option D is the only chemically and mathematically consistent answer, assuming the common simplification that the pH is determined by the excess strong acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the volume of acid and the final pH are chemically consistent with each other. The total amount of acid added must be sufficient for two purposes:\n1.  To react stoichiometrically with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  To provide the remaining excess H⁺ ions that establish the final pH of the 100 cm³ solution.\n\nLet's analyze this step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ and the stoichiometric acid required.**\n\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol (Fe: 55.85, O: 16.00, H: 1.01).\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n*   The dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\n*   From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed for reaction = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Any option with an acid volume that provides fewer moles than this stoichiometric minimum can be eliminated.\n*   Volume needed for reaction = Moles / Concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\n*   Option D (20.40 cm³) provides less acid than is needed to simply dissolve the Fe(OH)₃, so it is incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Test the remaining options for self-consistency.**\n\nWe will check if the given volume of acid in each option is sufficient to both complete the reaction (Step 1) and establish the given pH.\n\n**Testing Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ added:** Volume × Concentration = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n*   This amount (0.002805 mol) is almost exactly the amount needed just for the reaction (0.002807 mol). There are virtually no excess H⁺ ions from the strong acid.\n*   If there is no excess strong acid, the pH would be determined solely by the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ product. Calculations show this would result in a pH of around 2.2-2.3, not 2.04.\n*   Furthermore, to achieve a pH of 2.04, the concentration of H⁺ must be 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.00912 M. This would require 0.000912 moles of excess H⁺ in the 0.1 L solution, which this volume of acid does not provide.\n*   Therefore, option C is inconsistent.\n\n**Testing Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ added:** Volume × Concentration = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **H⁺ used for reaction:** 0.002807 mol (from Step 1).\n*   **Excess H⁺ remaining:** Total H⁺ added - H⁺ used for reaction = 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = **0.000202 mol**.\n*   **Final [H⁺] concentration:** Moles / Volume = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n*   **Calculate pH from this concentration:** pH = -log₁₀(0.00202) ≈ **2.695**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pH calculated from the excess acid in option B (2.695) is an almost perfect match for the pH given in option B (2.69). This demonstrates that the values in option B are self-consistent. The volume of 30.09 cm³ is the correct amount of acid to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the precise amount of excess H⁺ needed to create a pH of 2.69 in the final solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass = (Atomic Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Atomic Mass of O + Atomic Mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass = 55.845 g/mol + 3 × (15.999 g/mol + 1.008 g/mol) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in the 0.1 g sample:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Requirements**\nThe added strong acid (H⁺) serves two purposes:\n*   **Part 1 (Reaction):** It must react with and neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ according to the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n*   **Part 2 (Equilibrium):** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to keep the final pH low enough for the Fe³⁺ ions to stay dissolved.\n\nThe reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**3. The Consistency Check Method**\nThe most reliable way to solve this multiple-choice problem is to check which of the given options is self-consistent. For the correct option, the given volume of acid must be exactly the amount needed to perform both Part 1 and Part 2 (for the given pH).\n\n*   **Calculate Moles for Reaction (Part 1):**\n    Based on the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction are:\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol = 0.00280725 mol.\n\n*   **Test Option C (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³):**\n    *   **Calculate Moles for Equilibrium (Part 2):**\n        If the final pH is 2.69, the final H⁺ concentration is [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n        The moles of H⁺ needed to achieve this pH in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) final volume are:\n        Moles H⁺ (equilibrium) = Concentration × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol.\n\n    *   **Calculate Total Moles of H⁺ Needed:**\n        Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (equilibrium)\n        Total Moles H⁺ = 0.00280725 mol + 0.0002042 mol = 0.00301145 mol.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Required Volume of 0.1 M Acid:**\n        Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.00301145 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0301145 L.\n        Converting to cm³: Volume = 0.0301145 L × 1000 cm³/L ≈ 30.11 cm³.\n\n    *   **Compare:** This calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is an excellent match for the 30.09 cm³ given in Option C. The minor difference is due to rounding.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Other Options**\n*   **Option D:** The volume of 20.40 cm³ is less than the ~28.07 cm³ required just for the neutralization reaction. Therefore, it's impossible to dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Option B:** The volume of 28.05 cm³ is almost exactly the amount needed for the reaction, leaving virtually no excess acid. The pH would then be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺, which results in a pH of about 2.3, not 2.04. The values are inconsistent.\n*   **Option A:** A similar consistency check shows that the volume of 32.14 cm³ does not correspond to the amount of acid needed to achieve a pH of 3.16.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option C is the only one where the provided volume and pH are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid is sufficient to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH in the 100 cm³ solution. This requires a step-by-step analysis that checks for self-consistency.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nFirst, we determine the number of moles in 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is: 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009357 mol**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the acid requirement**\nThe total amount of strong acid (H⁺) added must serve two purposes:\n1.  **React with Fe(OH)₃:** The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l). Based on the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Establish the final pH:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to make it acidic to the specified pH.\n\n**Step 3: Test the options for self-consistency**\nWe will now test each option to see if the provided volume of acid matches the calculated total requirement for the given pH.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction** = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = **0.002807 mol**. This amount is constant for all checks.\n\nLet's analyze **Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**.\n\n*   **Calculate the moles of H⁺ needed to remain in solution for the final pH:**\n    *   The final concentration of H⁺ is [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   In a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L), the moles of excess H⁺ needed are:\n    *   Moles H⁺ (solution) = Concentration × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (solution)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030112 mol**.\n\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid that provides this total amount of H⁺:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n    *   Converting to cm³: 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ required to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and achieve a pH of 2.69 is an excellent match for the volume of 30.09 cm³ given in Option D. The minor difference is negligible and due to rounding. No other option demonstrates this level of self-consistency. For example, Option B provides only enough acid for the reaction itself, leaving no excess to lower the pH to 2.04. Option C does not provide enough acid to even dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe analysis and code execution have successfully identified the correct answer by systematically applying chemical constraints.\n\n1.  **Stoichiometric Pruning**: The first constraint established that a minimum of 28.07 cm³ of acid is required just to react with the Fe(OH)₃. This immediately invalidated options B (28.05 cm³) and D (20.40 cm³), as they provide insufficient acid to complete the primary reaction.\n\n2.  **Consistency Check**: The second constraint tested the remaining candidates (A and C) for self-consistency. The total volume of acid must account for both the reaction and the excess H⁺ needed to create the final pH.\n    *   For candidate A (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³), the calculated required volume was 30.11 cm³, which is an excellent match for the given volume.\n    *   For candidate C (pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³), the calculated required volume was 28.76 cm³, which is a significant mismatch with the given volume.\n\nThe process correctly concluded that only option A satisfies all chemical and mathematical requirements of the problem.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a two-part calculation. First, we need to determine the amount of strong acid required to stoichiometrically react with the iron(III) hydroxide. Second, we need to account for the additional acid required to lower the pH of the final solution to a level where the Fe(OH)₃ will not re-precipitate. The correct answer will be the option where the given volume of acid is consistent with the amount needed for both of these purposes.\n\nLet's break down the calculation step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is: 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   The number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ is:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.00093575 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the acid required for the reaction**\n\nThe dissolution reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n*   From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 * 0.00093575 mol = **0.00280725 mol**.\n\n**Step 3: Test the options for self-consistency**\n\nThe total acid added must equal the sum of the acid used in the reaction and the excess acid remaining in the solution that sets the final pH. We can test each option to see if the numbers are consistent.\n\nThe formula to check is:\nTotal Moles H⁺ Needed = (Moles for reaction) + (Moles for final pH)\nCalculated Volume = (Total Moles H⁺ Needed) / (Acid Concentration)\n\nLet's test **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of H⁺ needed for the final pH:**\n    The final solution has a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ for pH = [H⁺] × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ needed:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles for reaction) + (Moles for final pH)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.00280725 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.00301145 mol**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the required volume of 0.1 M acid:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration\n    *   Volume = 0.00301145 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0301145 L.\n\n4.  **Compare the calculated volume to the given volume:**\n    *   Calculated Volume = 0.0301145 L × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n    *   The given volume in Option B is **30.09 cm³**.\n\nThe calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the volume given in Option B (30.09 cm³). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding of constants. Let's quickly check another option to be sure.\n\n**Test Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n1.  Moles H⁺ for pH 2.04 = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\n2.  Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.000912 mol = 0.003719 mol.\n3.  Calculated Volume = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the given volume (28.05 cm³).\n\nThe self-consistency check clearly shows that Option B is the only one where the amount of acid provided is correct for both neutralizing the Fe(OH)₃ and establishing the specified final pH.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer from the given options.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis Strategy\n\n1.  **Two Requirements for Dissolution**: To dissolve the iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, the added strong acid (H⁺) must fulfill two roles:\n    a.  **Stoichiometric Reaction**: It must provide enough H⁺ to react with all of the Fe(OH)₃ according to the equation: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\n    b.  **Maintaining Acidity**: It must provide an additional amount of H⁺ that remains in the solution to keep the final pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃.\n\n2.  **Internal Consistency Check**: Since the problem provides pairs of values (pH and volume), the most reliable solution method is to check which pair is self-consistent. A consistent option is one where the given volume of acid is exactly the amount needed to both complete the stoichiometric reaction and establish the given final pH in the 100 cm³ solution.\n\n3.  **Constants**:\n    *   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n    *   Total Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n    *   Acid Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 106.87 g/mol (Fe: 55.85, O: 16.00, H: 1.01)\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation (Testing for Consistency)\n\nLet's perform the consistency check on the most plausible options.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction.**\nThis amount is constant for all options.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n*   From the 1:3 stoichiometry (Fe(OH)₃ : H⁺), the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction are:\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Step 2: Test Option A (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³).**\n*   **Calculate moles of H⁺ needed to maintain the pH:**\n    *   The final concentration of H⁺ required is [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   In a final volume of 0.1 L, the moles of H⁺ remaining in the solution are:\n        Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ that must be added:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030112 mol**.\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required to supply this total:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n*   **Conclusion for Option A**: The calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the volume given in the option (30.09 cm³). This option is internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Test Option D (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³).**\n*   **Calculate moles of H⁺ needed to maintain the pH:**\n    *   The final concentration of H⁺ required is [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.009120 M.\n    *   In a final volume of 0.1 L, the moles of H⁺ remaining in the solution are:\n        Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 0.009120 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0009120 mol**.\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ that must be added:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.0009120 mol = **0.003719 mol**.\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required to supply this total:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03719 L.\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.03719 L × 1000 cm³/L = **37.19 cm³**.\n*   **Conclusion for Option D**: The calculated required volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume given in the option (28.05 cm³). This option is not internally consistent.\n\nThe other options can be eliminated on similar grounds. Option B has a volume (20.40 cm³) that is insufficient to even complete the stoichiometric reaction (which requires at least 28.07 cm³). Option C is also inconsistent when checked.\n\nTherefore, the only option where the volume of acid correctly accounts for both the neutralization reaction and the final pH is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "This problem requires finding the specific volume of acid and resulting pH that are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other. The most robust method, as demonstrated by the majority of the candidate answers, is to perform a self-consistency check on each multiple-choice option.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   First, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n    *   Next, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009357 mol**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Acid Required for Stoichiometric Reaction:**\n    *   The chemical reaction for dissolving the base in a strong acid is:\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    *   The stoichiometry is 3 moles of H⁺ for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n3.  **Perform a Consistency Check on the Options:**\n    The total acid added must accomplish two things: 1) react with the Fe(OH)₃, and 2) leave an excess of H⁺ to establish the final pH. The correct option must satisfy this balance:\n    **Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles for Reaction + Moles for pH**\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Minimum Volume.** The volume of 0.1 M acid needed just for the reaction is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = **28.07 cm³**.

This option is self-consistent.\n\n    *   **Test Option A: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n        *   **Moles of H⁺ for pH:**\n            [H⁺] = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M ≈ 0.000692 M\n            Moles H⁺ (for pH) = 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = **0.0000692 mol**.\n        *   **Total Moles of H⁺ Required:**\n            Total Moles = 0.002807 mol (reaction) + 0.0000692 mol (for pH) = **0.0028762 mol**.\n        *   **Calculated Volume of Acid:**\n            Volume = 0.0028762 mol / 0.1 M = 0.028762 L = **28.76 cm³**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The calculated volume (28.76 cm³) does not match the given volume (32.14 cm³). This option is inconsistent.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis confirms that only Option C provides a pair of values where the volume of acid is chemically and mathematically consistent with the amount needed to both dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH. While the candidate answers showed confusion in labeling their final choice (A, B, C, or D), the underlying calculation in almost all of them correctly identified the pair \"pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\" as the solution.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The balanced equation is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    Based on the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ needed for this reaction are:\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = **0.002807 mol**\n\n2.  **Maintaining Final pH:** After the reaction, some excess H⁺ must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to keep it acidic and ensure the Fe(OH)₃ does not re-precipitate. The amount of excess H⁺ determines the final pH.\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ that must be added is the sum of these two amounts:\n**Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (remaining for pH)**\n\n### Step 3: Test the Options for Self-Consistency\n\nSince this is a multiple-choice question, the most reliable method is to check which of the given options is arithmetically self-consistent based on the principles from Step 2.\n\n#### Option A: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   Moles H⁺ (remaining for pH) = [H⁺] × Volume = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L = 0.000069 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = 0.002876 mol\n*   Calculated Volume of 0.1 M acid = 0.002876 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02876 L = 28.76 cm³\n*   This **does not match** the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\n#### Option B: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n*   Volume of 0.1 M acid needed for the reaction alone is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 28.07 cm³.\n*   The given volume (20.40 cm³) is **insufficient** to even dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃. This option is impossible.\n\n#### Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   Moles H⁺ (remaining for pH) = [H⁺] × Volume = (10⁻².⁰⁴ M) × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.000912 mol = 0.003719 mol\n*   Calculated Volume of 0.1 M acid = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³\n*   This **does not match** the given volume of 28.05 cm³.\n\n#### Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n*   Moles H⁺ (remaining for pH) = [H⁺] × Volume = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ needed = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**\n*   Calculated Volume of 0.1 M acid = 0.003011 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03011 L = **30.11 cm³**\n*   This calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an **excellent match** for the given volume of 30.09 cm³.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   The analysis shows that only Option D provides a set of values where the volume of acid is consistent with the amount needed to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH.\n*   This calculation relies on a common simplifying assumption in such problems: that the final pH is determined by the excess strong acid, and the contribution from the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ product is considered negligible for the purpose of the calculation. While Fe³⁺ does hydrolyze to produce more H⁺, the self-consistency of the numbers in Option D strongly suggests this was the intended method of solution.\n*   Other options are either physically impossible (Option B) or arithmetically inconsistent (Options A and C).\n\nTherefore, Option D is the only chemically and mathematically consistent choice under the likely assumptions of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the volume of acid and the final pH are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other. The process involves calculating the amount of acid needed for two purposes:\n1.  To react stoichiometrically with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  To remain as excess H⁺ in the 100 cm³ solution to establish the final pH.\n\n**Step 1: Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol (Fe: 55.85, O: 16.00, H: 1.01).\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Acid Required for Stoichiometric Reaction**\nThe dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\nFrom the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ needed to react completely are:\n*   Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Consistency Check of the Options**\nNow, we test each option to see if the given volume of acid is sufficient to both complete the reaction and establish the given pH. The total moles of H⁺ required can be calculated as:\nTotal Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (for final pH)\nTotal Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + ([H⁺]final × 0.1 L)\nThe required volume is then: Volume = Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M.\n\n*   **Option A (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³):**\n    *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.00912 M.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (for pH) = 0.00912 M × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\n    *   Required Volume = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\n    *   This does not match the given volume of 28.05 cm³.\n\n*   **Option B (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³):**\n    *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.00204 M.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (for pH) = 0.00204 M × 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = 0.003011 mol.\n    *   Required Volume = 0.003011 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03011 L = 30.11 cm³.\n    *   This calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the given volume of 30.09 cm³.\n\n*   **Option C (pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³):**\n    *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M ≈ 0.00069 M.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (for pH) = 0.00069 M × 0.1 L = 0.000069 mol.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n    *   Required Volume = 0.002876 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02876 L = 28.76 cm³.\n    *   This does not match the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\n*   **Option D (pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³):**\n    *   The volume of acid needed just for the reaction is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 28.07 cm³. The given volume of 20.40 cm³ is insufficient to even dissolve the solid.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only option where the provided pH and volume are consistent with the chemical principles is Option B. The volume of 30.09 cm³ is almost exactly the amount required to neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to yield a pH of 2.69 in the final 100 cm³ solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid is consistent with the amount needed to both dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH. This requires a step-by-step analysis.\n\n**Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   First, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar Mass = (Molar Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Molar Mass of O + Molar Mass of H)\n    *   Molar Mass ≈ 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Next, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the acid required for the reaction (Stoichiometry):**\n    *   The chemical reaction for dissolution in a strong acid is:\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    *   The stoichiometry shows that 3 moles of H⁺ are required for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine the acid required to maintain the final pH (Excess Acid):**\n    *   The total acid added must not only react with the Fe(OH)₃ but also leave some excess H⁺ ions in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution to maintain the final acidic pH.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (excess) = Final [H⁺] × Total Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L.\n\n4.  **Test each option for consistency:**\n    *   The correct option must satisfy the following equation:\n        **Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Moles for Reaction + Moles for pH**\n    *   Where \"Total Moles of H⁺ Added\" is calculated from the volume given in the option (Volume × 0.1 M).\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   **A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = 0.002040 mol.\n    *   This is less than the 0.002807 mol required just for the reaction. Therefore, this volume is insufficient to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = 0.003009 mol.\n    *   Moles H⁺ for pH = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol.\n    *   Let's check the balance: Moles for Reaction + Moles for pH = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = 0.003011 mol.\n    *   This calculated total (0.003011 mol) is an excellent match for the actual amount of acid added (0.003009 mol). **Option B is self-consistent.**\n\n*   **C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n    *   This amount is almost exactly the amount needed for the reaction (0.002807 mol), leaving virtually no excess acid.\n    *   However, to achieve a pH of 2.04, a significant amount of excess acid is needed: Moles H⁺ for pH = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000912 mol.\n    *   The volume provided is insufficient to both react and establish this pH. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = 0.003214 mol.\n    *   Moles H⁺ for pH = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol.\n    *   Let's check the balance: Moles for Reaction + Moles for pH = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n    *   This calculated total (0.002876 mol) does not match the amount of acid added (0.003214 mol). **Option D is incorrect.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Option B provides a volume of acid and a final pH that are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Chemical Processes**\n\n1.  **Dissolution Reaction:** Solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, is a base. To dissolve it, we must add a strong acid (H⁺). The neutralization reaction is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This shows a 1:3 molar ratio between Fe(OH)₃ and H⁺.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium:** The total amount of acid added must be sufficient for two purposes:\n    a.  To react stoichiometrically with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n    b.  To leave a certain amount of excess H⁺ in the final solution. This excess H⁺ keeps the pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe correct answer must be a self-consistent pair of (pH, Volume) values that satisfies both of these conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\nNext, calculate the moles of H⁺ needed just for the reaction (stoichiometric amount).\n*   Moles of H⁺ (for reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Consistency Check on the Options**\n\nThe most reliable method is to test each option to see if the given volume of acid is exactly what's needed to (a) react with the Fe(OH)₃ and (b) establish the given pH in the final 100 cm³ solution.\n\nLet's test **Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ added** from the given volume:\n    *   Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ (added) = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of excess H⁺ remaining** in the solution to create the given pH:\n    *   Final [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   Final Solution Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] × Volume = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ that must have reacted:**\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = Total Moles H⁺ (added) - Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 0.003009 mol - 0.0002042 mol = **0.0028048 mol**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the stoichiometric requirement:**\n    *   The calculated moles of H⁺ that reacted (0.0028048 mol) is an almost perfect match for the stoichiometric amount we calculated in Step 2 (0.002807 mol). The tiny difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding.\n\nThis shows that Option C is internally consistent.\n\n**Step 4: Check Other Options (for completeness)**\n\n*   **Option D (20.40 cm³):** This volume provides only 0.00204 mol of H⁺, which is less than the 0.002807 mol needed just to react with the Fe(OH)₃. Therefore, the solid would not fully dissolve. This option is invalid.\n*   **Option A (28.05 cm³):** This volume provides 0.002805 mol of H⁺, which is almost exactly the stoichiometric amount. This leaves virtually no excess acid. The pH would then be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺, which results in a pH of about 2.3, not 2.04. Thus, this option is inconsistent.\n*   **Option B (32.14 cm³):** A similar consistency check shows a significant mismatch between the required and calculated amounts.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only option where the volume of acid and the final pH are chemically consistent with each other is Option C. The 30.09 cm³ of acid is the precise amount needed to both neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave enough excess H⁺ to lower the pH of the 100 cm³ solution to 2.69.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Foundational Calculations**\n\nFirst, we must determine the number of moles of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, to be dissolved.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:\n    *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n    *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n    *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Total Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**\n*   The number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ is:\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009357 mol**\n\n**2. The Chemical Reaction and Acid Requirement**\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid is a neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ ions from the strong acid serves two purposes:\n*   **Part 1 (Reaction):** An amount of H⁺ is consumed to react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Part 2 (Excess):** An additional amount of H⁺ must remain in the solution to establish the final acidic pH, which ensures the Fe(OH)₃ stays dissolved.\n\n**3. Consistency Check of the Options**\n\nThe correct option must be chemically and mathematically self-consistent. We can test each option by calculating the total moles of H⁺ required (Part 1 + Part 2) and seeing if it matches the moles of H⁺ supplied by the given volume of acid.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction (Part 1):**\n    Based on the stoichiometry (3 moles of H⁺ per mole of Fe(OH)₃):\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = **0.002807 mol**\n\nNow, we test each option:\n\n**A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ supplied:** Volume × Molarity = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for final pH (Part 2):** [H⁺] × Volume = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol\n*   **Total H⁺ needed (Part 1 + Part 2):** 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** The moles supplied (0.003009) and the moles needed (0.003011) are an excellent match. The difference is negligible and due to rounding. **This option is consistent.**\n\n**B) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   The volume of acid supplied (20.40 cm³) is less than the volume required just for the stoichiometric reaction (~28.07 cm³). The Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n**C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ supplied:** 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = **0.002805 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for final pH (Part 2):** (10⁻².⁰⁴ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000912 mol\n*   **Total H⁺ needed (Part 1 + Part 2):** 0.002807 mol + 0.000912 mol = **0.003719 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** The moles supplied (0.002805) are far less than the moles needed (0.003719). The acid provided is only enough for the reaction, with none left over to create the highly acidic pH of 2.04. **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n**D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ supplied:** 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for final pH (Part 2):** (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol\n*   **Total H⁺ needed (Part 1 + Part 2):** 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = **0.002876 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** The moles supplied (0.003214) are significantly different from the moles needed (0.002876). **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the values presented in option A are self-consistent. The volume of acid provided (30.09 cm³) is sufficient to both neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to produce a final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Understand the Acid Requirement**\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid is a neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the strong acid must serve two purposes:\n*   **Part 1 (Reaction):** React stoichiometrically with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Part 2 (Excess):** Remain in the 100 cm³ solution to create the final acidic pH.\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ for the Reaction (Part 1)**\n\nFrom the reaction's stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × 0.00093575 mol = 0.00280725 mol.\n\n**4. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nThe correct option must provide a volume of acid that supplies enough H⁺ for both Part 1 and Part 2. We can test each option to see if the numbers are consistent.\n\n**Let's test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:**\n    The volume of the 0.1 M acid is 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L).\n    Total Moles H⁺ = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Required (Calculated):**\n    *   Part 1 (Reaction): We already calculated this as **0.00280725 mol**.\n    *   Part 2 (Excess for pH): The final pH is 2.69. The concentration of H⁺ needed is [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M. In a 100 cm³ (0.1 L) volume, the moles of excess H⁺ are:\n      Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n    *   Total Required Moles = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (excess)\n      Total Required Moles = 0.00280725 + 0.0002042 = **0.00301145 mol**.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    The total moles of H⁺ added from the given volume (0.003009 mol) is an excellent match for the total moles required to perform the reaction and establish the given pH (0.003011 mol).

This volume is insufficient to dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃, let alone create an even more acidic pH of 2.04. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A is the only choice where the provided volume of acid and the resulting pH are chemically and mathematically consistent. The amount of acid is sufficient to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to achieve the specified pH.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires finding a self-consistent pair of values: the volume of acid needed and the resulting pH. There are two main components to the acid's role:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction:** A certain amount of acid is consumed to neutralize and dissolve the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Final pH:** An excess amount of acid must remain in the solution to keep it acidic enough for the Fe(OH)₃ to stay dissolved. The final pH is determined by the concentration of this excess H⁺.\n\nThe most robust method to solve this is to test each multiple-choice option for self-consistency. We can take the pH from an option, calculate the total amount of acid that would be required to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and achieve that pH, and then see if the resulting volume matches the volume given in that same option.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 0.0009356 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of H⁺ for Stoichiometric Reaction:**\n    The reaction is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ needed for reaction = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009356 mol = **0.002807 mol**.\n\n3.  **Test Option D (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³):**\n    This option proposes that the final pH is 2.69. Let's calculate the total acid needed to achieve this.\n    *   **Moles of H⁺ to maintain pH:** The excess H⁺ in the solution determines the final pH.\n        *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n        *   Moles of excess H⁺ = Concentration × Volume = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n    *   **Total Moles of H⁺ Required:** This is the sum of the acid for the reaction and the excess acid for the pH.\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol (for reaction) + 0.0002042 mol (for pH) = **0.0030112 mol**.\n    *   **Calculate Required Volume of Acid:** The acid is 0.1 M.\n        *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n        *   Volume in cm³ = 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is an excellent match for the volume given in Option D (30.09 cm³). The minor difference is due to rounding of constants. No other option demonstrates this level of self-consistency. For example, options B and C provide insufficient acid to even complete the stoichiometric reaction (28.05 cm³ and 20.40 cm³ are both less than the required ~28.07 cm³ plus any excess). Therefore, Option D is the only chemically and mathematically consistent answer, assuming the common simplification that the pH is determined by the excess strong acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the volume of acid and the final pH are chemically consistent with each other. The total amount of acid added must be sufficient for two purposes:\n1.  To react stoichiometrically with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  To provide the remaining excess H⁺ ions that establish the final pH of the 100 cm³ solution.\n\nLet's analyze this step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ and the stoichiometric acid required.**\n\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol (Fe: 55.85, O: 16.00, H: 1.01).\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n*   The dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\n*   From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed for reaction = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Any option with an acid volume that provides fewer moles than this stoichiometric minimum can be eliminated.\n*   Volume needed for reaction = Moles / Concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\n*   Option D (20.40 cm³) provides less acid than is needed to simply dissolve the Fe(OH)₃, so it is incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Test the remaining options for self-consistency.**\n\nWe will check if the given volume of acid in each option is sufficient to both complete the reaction (Step 1) and establish the given pH.\n\n**Testing Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ added:** Volume × Concentration = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n*   This amount (0.002805 mol) is almost exactly the amount needed just for the reaction (0.002807 mol). There are virtually no excess H⁺ ions from the strong acid.\n*   If there is no excess strong acid, the pH would be determined solely by the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ product. Calculations show this would result in a pH of around 2.2-2.3, not 2.04.\n*   Furthermore, to achieve a pH of 2.04, the concentration of H⁺ must be 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.00912 M. This would require 0.000912 moles of excess H⁺ in the 0.1 L solution, which this volume of acid does not provide.\n*   Therefore, option C is inconsistent.\n\n**Testing Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ added:** Volume × Concentration = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **H⁺ used for reaction:** 0.002807 mol (from Step 1).\n*   **Excess H⁺ remaining:** Total H⁺ added - H⁺ used for reaction = 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = **0.000202 mol**.\n*   **Final [H⁺] concentration:** Moles / Volume = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n*   **Calculate pH from this concentration:** pH = -log₁₀(0.00202) ≈ **2.695**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pH calculated from the excess acid in option B (2.695) is an almost perfect match for the pH given in option B (2.69). This demonstrates that the values in option B are self-consistent. The volume of 30.09 cm³ is the correct amount of acid to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the precise amount of excess H⁺ needed to create a pH of 2.69 in the final solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass = (Atomic Mass of Fe) + 3 × (Atomic Mass of O + Atomic Mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass = 55.845 g/mol + 3 × (15.999 g/mol + 1.008 g/mol) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in the 0.1 g sample:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Requirements**\nThe added strong acid (H⁺) serves two purposes:\n*   **Part 1 (Reaction):** It must react with and neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ according to the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n*   **Part 2 (Equilibrium):** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to keep the final pH low enough for the Fe³⁺ ions to stay dissolved.\n\nThe reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**3. The Consistency Check Method**\nThe most reliable way to solve this multiple-choice problem is to check which of the given options is self-consistent. For the correct option, the given volume of acid must be exactly the amount needed to perform both Part 1 and Part 2 (for the given pH).\n\n*   **Calculate Moles for Reaction (Part 1):**\n    Based on the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction are:\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol = 0.00280725 mol.\n\n*   **Test Option C (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³):**\n    *   **Calculate Moles for Equilibrium (Part 2):**\n        If the final pH is 2.69, the final H⁺ concentration is [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n        The moles of H⁺ needed to achieve this pH in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) final volume are:\n        Moles H⁺ (equilibrium) = Concentration × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol.\n\n    *   **Calculate Total Moles of H⁺ Needed:**\n        Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (equilibrium)\n        Total Moles H⁺ = 0.00280725 mol + 0.0002042 mol = 0.00301145 mol.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Required Volume of 0.1 M Acid:**\n        Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.00301145 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0301145 L.\n        Converting to cm³: Volume = 0.0301145 L × 1000 cm³/L ≈ 30.11 cm³.\n\n    *   **Compare:** This calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is an excellent match for the 30.09 cm³ given in Option C. The minor difference is due to rounding.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Other Options**\n*   **Option D:** The volume of 20.40 cm³ is less than the ~28.07 cm³ required just for the neutralization reaction. Therefore, it's impossible to dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Option B:** The volume of 28.05 cm³ is almost exactly the amount needed for the reaction, leaving virtually no excess acid. The pH would then be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺, which results in a pH of about 2.3, not 2.04. The values are inconsistent.\n*   **Option A:** A similar consistency check shows that the volume of 32.14 cm³ does not correspond to the amount of acid needed to achieve a pH of 3.16.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option C is the only one where the provided volume and pH are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the given volume of acid is sufficient to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given final pH in the 100 cm³ solution. This requires a step-by-step analysis that checks for self-consistency.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nFirst, we determine the number of moles in 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is: 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009357 mol**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the acid requirement**\nThe total amount of strong acid (H⁺) added must serve two purposes:\n1.  **React with Fe(OH)₃:** The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l). Based on the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Establish the final pH:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to make it acidic to the specified pH.\n\n**Step 3: Test the options for self-consistency**\nWe will now test each option to see if the provided volume of acid matches the calculated total requirement for the given pH.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction** = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = **0.002807 mol**. This amount is constant for all checks.\n\nLet's analyze **Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**.\n\n*   **Calculate the moles of H⁺ needed to remain in solution for the final pH:**\n    *   The final concentration of H⁺ is [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   In a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L), the moles of excess H⁺ needed are:\n    *   Moles H⁺ (solution) = Concentration × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (solution)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030112 mol**.\n\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid that provides this total amount of H⁺:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n    *   Converting to cm³: 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ required to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and achieve a pH of 2.69 is an excellent match for the volume of 30.09 cm³ given in Option D. The minor difference is negligible and due to rounding. No other option demonstrates this level of self-consistency. For example, Option B provides only enough acid for the reaction itself, leaving no excess to lower the pH to 2.04. Option C does not provide enough acid to even dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe analysis and code execution have successfully identified the correct answer by systematically applying chemical constraints.\n\n1.  **Stoichiometric Pruning**: The first constraint established that a minimum of 28.07 cm³ of acid is required just to react with the Fe(OH)₃. This immediately invalidated options B (28.05 cm³) and D (20.40 cm³), as they provide insufficient acid to complete the primary reaction.\n\n2.  **Consistency Check**: The second constraint tested the remaining candidates (A and C) for self-consistency. The total volume of acid must account for both the reaction and the excess H⁺ needed to create the final pH.\n    *   For candidate A (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³), the calculated required volume was 30.11 cm³, which is an excellent match for the given volume.\n    *   For candidate C (pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³), the calculated required volume was 28.76 cm³, which is a significant mismatch with the given volume.\n\nThe process correctly concluded that only option A satisfies all chemical and mathematical requirements of the problem.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a two-part calculation. First, we need to determine the amount of strong acid required to stoichiometrically react with the iron(III) hydroxide. Second, we need to account for the additional acid required to lower the pH of the final solution to a level where the Fe(OH)₃ will not re-precipitate. The correct answer will be the option where the given volume of acid is consistent with the amount needed for both of these purposes.\n\nLet's break down the calculation step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is: 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   The number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ is:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.00093575 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the acid required for the reaction**\n\nThe dissolution reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n*   From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 * 0.00093575 mol = **0.00280725 mol**.\n\n**Step 3: Test the options for self-consistency**\n\nThe total acid added must equal the sum of the acid used in the reaction and the excess acid remaining in the solution that sets the final pH. We can test each option to see if the numbers are consistent.\n\nThe formula to check is:\nTotal Moles H⁺ Needed = (Moles for reaction) + (Moles for final pH)\nCalculated Volume = (Total Moles H⁺ Needed) / (Acid Concentration)\n\nLet's test **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of H⁺ needed for the final pH:**\n    The final solution has a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ for pH = [H⁺] × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ needed:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles for reaction) + (Moles for final pH)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.00280725 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.00301145 mol**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the required volume of 0.1 M acid:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration\n    *   Volume = 0.00301145 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0301145 L.\n\n4.  **Compare the calculated volume to the given volume:**\n    *   Calculated Volume = 0.0301145 L × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n    *   The given volume in Option B is **30.09 cm³**.\n\nThe calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the volume given in Option B (30.09 cm³). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding of constants. Let's quickly check another option to be sure.\n\n**Test Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n1.  Moles H⁺ for pH 2.04 = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\n2.  Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.000912 mol = 0.003719 mol.\n3.  Calculated Volume = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the given volume (28.05 cm³).\n\nThe self-consistency check clearly shows that Option B is the only one where the amount of acid provided is correct for both neutralizing the Fe(OH)₃ and establishing the specified final pH.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer from the given options.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis Strategy\n\n1.  **Two Requirements for Dissolution**: To dissolve the iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, the added strong acid (H⁺) must fulfill two roles:\n    a.  **Stoichiometric Reaction**: It must provide enough H⁺ to react with all of the Fe(OH)₃ according to the equation: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\n    b.  **Maintaining Acidity**: It must provide an additional amount of H⁺ that remains in the solution to keep the final pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃.\n\n2.  **Internal Consistency Check**: Since the problem provides pairs of values (pH and volume), the most reliable solution method is to check which pair is self-consistent. A consistent option is one where the given volume of acid is exactly the amount needed to both complete the stoichiometric reaction and establish the given final pH in the 100 cm³ solution.\n\n3.  **Constants**:\n    *   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n    *   Total Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n    *   Acid Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 106.87 g/mol (Fe: 55.85, O: 16.00, H: 1.01)\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation (Testing for Consistency)\n\nLet's perform the consistency check on the most plausible options.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction.**\nThis amount is constant for all options.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n*   From the 1:3 stoichiometry (Fe(OH)₃ : H⁺), the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction are:\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Step 2: Test Option A (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³).**\n*   **Calculate moles of H⁺ needed to maintain the pH:**\n    *   The final concentration of H⁺ required is [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   In a final volume of 0.1 L, the moles of H⁺ remaining in the solution are:\n        Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ that must be added:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030112 mol**.\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required to supply this total:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.0030112 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.030112 L × 1000 cm³/L = **30.11 cm³**.\n*   **Conclusion for Option A**: The calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the volume given in the option (30.09 cm³). This option is internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Test Option D (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³).**\n*   **Calculate moles of H⁺ needed to maintain the pH:**\n    *   The final concentration of H⁺ required is [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.009120 M.\n    *   In a final volume of 0.1 L, the moles of H⁺ remaining in the solution are:\n        Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 0.009120 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0009120 mol**.\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ that must be added:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 mol + 0.0009120 mol = **0.003719 mol**.\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required to supply this total:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03719 L.\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.03719 L × 1000 cm³/L = **37.19 cm³**.\n*   **Conclusion for Option D**: The calculated required volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume given in the option (28.05 cm³). This option is not internally consistent.\n\nThe other options can be eliminated on similar grounds. Option B has a volume (20.40 cm³) that is insufficient to even complete the stoichiometric reaction (which requires at least 28.07 cm³). Option C is also inconsistent when checked.\n\nTherefore, the only option where the volume of acid correctly accounts for both the neutralization reaction and the final pH is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
