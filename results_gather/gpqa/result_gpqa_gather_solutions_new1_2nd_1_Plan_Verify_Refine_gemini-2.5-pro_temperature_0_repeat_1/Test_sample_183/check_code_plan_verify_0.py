    # This path forms aniline first, then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
    reason_a = "Path A is incorrect because step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring."

    # This path forms tert-butylbenzene, then nitrates it.
    reason_b = "Path B is incorrect for a high-yield synthesis because the nitration of tert-butylbenzene (step ii) overwhelmingly produces the para-isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene). This 1,4-substitution pattern cannot lead to the desired 1,2,3-substituted target molecule."

    # This path is nonsensically written and has an impossible reaction order.
    reason_c = "Path C is incorrect because it is nonsensically written and contains an impossible reaction order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (NaNO2/HCl) before the required primary amine group has been formed."

    # Analysis of Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... ix) NaOH/EtBr
    # This path describes the correct, albeit complex, blocking group strategy.
    # i) Alkylation -> tert-butylbenzene
    # ii) Sulfonation -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocks para position)
    # iii) Nitration -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (regioselective)
    # iv) Reduction -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid
    # v) Diazotization -> diazonium salt
    # vi) Second Nitration -> places NO2 at C6

    # ix) Etherification -> 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene
