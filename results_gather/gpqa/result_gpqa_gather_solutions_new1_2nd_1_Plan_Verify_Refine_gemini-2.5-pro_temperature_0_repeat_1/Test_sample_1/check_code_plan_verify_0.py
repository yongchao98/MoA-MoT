    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, highlighting the careful points needed to arrive at the correct answer.

    **Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**
    *   **Careful Point:** The first step is to correctly identify the starting material and count its carbon atoms.
    *   **Starting Material:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde. Its structure is a phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to a propenal chain (-CH=CH-CHO).
    *   **Carbon Count:** The phenyl ring has 6 carbons, and the propenal chain has 3 carbons. Total = 6 + 3 = **9 carbon atoms**.
    *   **Reaction 1:** It is treated with methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), a Grignard reagent. This reaction adds the methyl group (CH₃) to the carbonyl carbon.
    *   **Carbon Change:** This adds exactly one carbon atom.
    *   **Product 1 Carbon Count:** 9 + 1 = **10 carbon atoms**.

    **Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**
    *   **Careful Point:** Understand the function of the reagent PCC.
    *   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is a secondary alcohol with 10 carbons.
    *   **Reaction 2:** It is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC). PCC is an oxidizing agent that converts a secondary alcohol to a ketone.
    *   **Carbon Change:** This oxidation reaction changes a functional group but does not add or remove any carbon atoms from the molecule's skeleton. The carbon count is unchanged.
    *   **Product 2 Carbon Count:** The count remains **10 carbon atoms**.

    **Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**
    *   **Careful Point 1:** Recognize the logical typo in the question. "3 was treated..." should be read as "product 2 was treated..." to form product 3.
    *   **Careful Point 2:** Identify the reagent and its specific reactivity with an α,β-unsaturated ketone.
    *   **Starting Material:** Product 2, an α,β-unsaturated ketone with 10 carbons.
    *   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the systematic name for the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.
    *   **Reaction 3:** When this reagent reacts with an α,β-unsaturated ketone, it adds a methylene group (-CH₂-) across the carbon-carbon double bond to form a cyclopropane ring.
    *   **Carbon Change:** This adds exactly one carbon atom.
    *   **Product 3 Carbon Count:** 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.

    **Conclusion:**
    The final product, Product 3, contains 11 carbon atoms. Matching this result to the given options:
    A) 10
    B) 12
    C) 14
    D) 11

    The correct option is D.
