Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate responses.

### 1. Deconstruct the Core Chemical Problem

The question describes a tandem catalysis process to create polyethylene with "regular branches" from a single reactant, ethylene. This requires a dual-catalyst system where two reactions occur simultaneously:
*   **Reaction 1 (Oligomerization):** This is the "essential additional reaction step." One catalyst must selectively convert some ethylene molecules into a specific short-chain alpha-olefin (e.g., trimerizing three ethylene molecules into one 1-hexene molecule). The high selectivity of this step is crucial for creating "regular" branches.
*   **Reaction 2 (Copolymerization):** A second catalyst polymerizes the remaining ethylene while incorporating the newly formed alpha-olefin as a comonomer, creating the branched polymer.

### 2. Synthesize the Analysis of Each Statement

By examining the reasoning within the 15 candidate answers, a clear consensus emerges on the validity of each statement, despite the confusion in their final lettered choices.

*   **Statement A: Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**
    *   **Consensus Analysis:** This statement is considered misleading and not the best answer. While noble metals (like palladium) can create branched polyethylene, they typically do so via a "chain-walking" mechanism. This process creates a variety of branch lengths and structures (hyperbranching), which does not align with the goal of creating "regular branches" from a specific comonomer. Therefore, this technology is not suitable for the stated goal.

*   **Statement B: One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**
    *   **Consensus Analysis:** There is overwhelming agreement that this statement is **factually correct, unambiguous, and fundamental** to the problem. Group VIa (also known as Group 6) contains Chromium (Cr). Chromium-based catalysts are the state-of-the-art industrial technology for the highly selective oligomerization of ethylene to 1-hexene and 1-octene. This is precisely the function required for the "essential additional reaction step." The statement correctly notes that these catalysts require "specific activators."

*   **Statement C: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**
    *   **Consensus Analysis:** This statement is deemed ambiguous and likely incorrect under a strict technical interpretation. The term "combined system" implies a single-reactor process where both oligomerization and polymerization occur together. While the *component technologies* are industrialized in the US (e.g., producing 1-hexene in one plant and using it in another), a true single-reactor tandem process is a major research goal and not yet a widespread, large-scale industrial reality.

*   **Statement D: Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**
    *   **Consensus Analysis:** There is unanimous agreement that this statement is **factually incorrect**. The essential oligomerization step, particularly when using the chromium-based catalysts from statement B, almost universally *requires* an aluminum-based compound as an activator (co-catalyst). Common examples include methylaluminoxane (MAO) and various trialkylaluminum compounds. These activators are essential for the catalyst to function.

### 3. Final Conclusion

Based on a careful synthesis of the reasoning provided by all candidate answers:
*   Statement D is definitively false.
*   Statement A is misleading in the context of producing *regular* branches.
*   Statement C is ambiguous and likely incorrect under a strict interpretation of industrial practice.
*   Statement B is a direct, unambiguous, and fundamentally correct statement describing the key chemical technology that enables the desired process.

Therefore, statement B is the only correct choice.
