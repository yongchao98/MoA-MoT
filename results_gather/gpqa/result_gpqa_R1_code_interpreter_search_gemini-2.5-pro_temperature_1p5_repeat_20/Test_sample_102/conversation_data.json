    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is also named 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.\n    *   Parent: Benzene\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   Acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   Bromine (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   Nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   All substituents are *meta* (1,3,5) to each other. This is a key feature of the molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall Directing Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Direct Synthesis Routes (and their problems):** The 1,3,5-pattern suggests that the substitutions should happen while a *meta*-director is on the ring.\n    *   **Path A:** Benzene -> Acetophenone (-COCH3) -> 3-Nitroacetophenone -> 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.\n        *   Step 1 (Acylation): Works fine.\n        *   Step 2 (Nitration): Acetophenone is a *meta*-director, so 3-nitroacetophenone is the major product. This works.\n        *   Step 3 (Bromination): The ring now has two strong deactivating groups (-COCH3 and -NO2), which both direct to position 5. While the regioselectivity is good, the reaction rate would be extremely slow, requiring harsh conditions and resulting in a very low yield. This conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n    *   **Path B:** Benzene -> Acetophenone (-COCH3) -> 3-Bromoacetophenone -> 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.\n        *   Step 1 (Acylation): Works fine.\n        *   Step 2 (Bromination): Acetophenone is a *meta*-director, so 3-bromoacetophenone is the major product. This works.\n        *   Step 3 (Nitration): In 3-bromoacetophenone, the directing effects are conflicting. -COCH3 directs to position 5, while -Br directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This typically leads to a mixture of isomers, so the yield of the desired product would not be \"high\".\n    *   **Path C:** Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> 3-Bromonitrobenzene -> ... (add acetyl group).\n        *   Steps 1 & 2 work well.\n        *   Step 3 (Acylation): Friedel-Crafts acylation fails on strongly deactivated rings like 3-bromonitrobenzene (the nitro group is too deactivating).\n\n4.  **Consider Advanced Strategies (Diazonium Chemistry):** The direct routes are problematic for achieving a high yield. The options provided include reagents for diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) and deamination (`H3PO2`). This is a strong hint that a \"placeholder\" amino group is used to direct the substitutions and then removed. The sequence is typically: `Ar-NO2 -> (Fe/HCl) -> Ar-NH2 -> (direct substitutions) -> (NaNO2/HCl) -> Ar-N2+ -> (H3PO2) -> Ar-H`.\n\n5.  **Develop a Synthesis Using Deamination:** Let's construct a logical sequence that would result in high yield. The goal is to place the substituents correctly around a temporary amino group. A good strategy is to use the powerful *ortho, para*-directing effect of an amine (or its protected form, acetamido, -NHCOCH3).\n    *   Let's place a temporary amino group at C4 to direct the other groups to C3 and C5.\n    *   **Start point:** A p-disubstituted benzene. Let's aim for p-aminoacetophenone (or its protected form, p-acetamidoacetophenone).\n    *   **Plausible sequence:**\n        a. **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene** (Nitration).\n        b. **Nitrobenzene -> Aniline** (Reduction, e.g., with `Fe/HCl`).\n        c. **Aniline -> p-Acetamidoacetophenone:** This can be tricky. A plausible, multi-step way is to protect the amine (Aniline -> Acetanilide) and then perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation, which occurs predominantly at the para position.\n        d. **Bromination:** On p-acetamidoacetophenone, both the -NHCOCH3 group (o,p-director) and the -COCH3 group (m-director) direct incoming electrophiles to position 3 (and 5). So, bromination at C3 is highly favored. Product: `3-bromo-4-acetamidoacetophenone`.\n        e. **Nitration:** On the product from (d), we need to add -NO2 at C5. Let's check the directors:\n            *   -NHCOCH3 at C4 (strongest activator) directs *ortho* to C5.\n            *   -COCH3 at C1 directs *meta* to C5.\n            *   -Br at C3 directs *meta* to C5.\n            All groups cooperate to direct nitration to position 5. This will be a high-yield step. Product: `3-bromo-5-nitro-4-acetamidoacetophenone`.\n        f. **Hydrolysis:** The protecting acetamido group (-NHCOCH3) must be converted back to an amino group (-NH2) before diazotization. This is done by acid hydrolysis (e.g., `H3O+`).\n        g. **Diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`):** The primary amine at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n        h. **Deamination (`H3PO2`):** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This entire sequence is logical, regioselective, and should be high-yield.\n\n6.  **Match the Developed Synthesis with the Options:** Now, let's see which option best represents this sequence.\n\n    *   **Option A:** i) `HNO3/H2SO4` ; ii) `Fe/HCl` ; iii) `CH3COCl/AlCl3` ; iv) `Br2/FeBr3` ; v) `HNO3/H2SO4` ; vi) `NaNO2/HCl` ; vii) `H3PO2`\n\n    Let's map this to our ideal sequence:\n    *   `i) & ii)`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. (Matches steps a & b).\n    *   `iii)`: Aniline -> ... Acylation. This corresponds to step (c), creating the acetophenone moiety para to the amino group. This is a condensed representation.\n    *   `iv)`: Bromination. (Matches step d).\n    *   `v)`: Nitration. (Matches step e).\n    *   `vi)`: Diazotization. (Matches step g). For this to work, the amide must be hydrolyzed. This hydrolysis (step f) might occur during the acidic nitration (step v) or its workup, so it's an implicit step.\n    *   `vii)`: Deamination. (Matches step h).\n\n    Option A, despite being a condensed notation and omitting the explicit protection/deprotection steps, follows the correct logical flow of the most reliable high-yield synthesis.\n\n7.  **Final Check of Other Options:**\n    *   **B:** The first three steps are a plausible but lower-yield direct route. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical if applied to the product of step (iii).\n    *   **C:** The first four steps simply convert benzene to aniline and back to benzene, which is pointless.\n    *   **D:** The sequence fails at step (iii) because Friedel-Crafts acylation does not work on the strongly deactivated p-bromonitrobenzene ring.\n\nConclusion: Option A is the only sequence that represents a viable, high-yield synthetic strategy for this complex substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
