    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we will use the following relationship:\n\n**Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) = Σ (Enthalpies of atomization of elements) - Σ (Bond energies of the molecule)**\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's analyze the structure to count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n*   (CH3)2C=: 3 carbons, 6 hydrogens\n*   =CH-: 1 carbon, 1 hydrogen\n*   -CH2-: 1 carbon, 2 hydrogens\n*   -CH(CH3)-: 2 carbons, 4 hydrogens (1 on the chain, 3 in the methyl group)\n*   -CH2-: 1 carbon, 2 hydrogens\n*   -CH=: 1 carbon, 1 hydrogen\n*   =C(CH3)2: 3 carbons, 6 hydrogens\n\nAdding these up:\n*   Total Carbons (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Hydrogens (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nWe need to count all the covalent bonds within one molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: The carbon skeleton consists of 12 carbon atoms. In a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of bonds between the N atoms in the skeleton is N-1. Here, N=12, so there are 12-1 = 11 total bonds (both single and double) connecting the carbon atoms. Since we already know there are 2 double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule (Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break one mole of the gaseous compound into its constituent gaseous atoms.\nΣ (Bond energies) = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΣ (Bond energies) = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΣ (Bond energies) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form the necessary gaseous atoms (12 moles of C, 22 moles of H) from the elements in their standard states (C(s, graphite) and H2(g)).\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nThe atomization process is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\nΣ (Enthalpies of atomization) = (12 × ΔH_atomization(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol (This breaks one mole of H2 into two moles of H)\n\nΣ (Enthalpies of atomization) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΣ (Enthalpies of atomization) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nΔHf° = Σ (Enthalpies of atomization of elements) - Σ (Bond energies of the molecule)\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g to Match the Options**\n\nThe question provides options in different units, so we need to convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. First, we calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n*   M = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔHf° (in kJ/g) = ΔHf° (in kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (in g/mol)\nΔHf° (in kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives 11.44 kJ/g. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
