    "*   **Analysis of the Goal:** The primary goal is to inactivate a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein. The most severe mutations are those that occur early in the gene's coding sequence and cause a drastic change in the resulting protein.\n\n*   **Types of Mutations and their Impact:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change that results in a different amino acid being incorporated. This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little or no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to inactivate the protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** The removal or addition of nucleotides in multiples of three. This results in the loss or gain of one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The resulting protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame from the point of the mutation onwards, scrambling all downstream amino acids. It usually leads to a premature stop codon, creating a truncated and non-functional protein.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that converts an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes translation to terminate prematurely, resulting in a shortened, and almost always non-functional, protein.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Mutants:** Let's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. We will read the DNA in groups of three (codons), starting from the ATG start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n        *   Translation: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n        *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Translation: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - Thr ...\n        *   **Result:** This is a missense mutation. Replacing one amino acid with another might not be sufficient to completely inactivate the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n        *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a stop codon.\n        *   Translation: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n        *   **Result:** This is a nonsense mutation. Protein synthesis will stop after only two amino acids. The resulting peptide will be completely non-functional. This is a very effective way to eliminate the gene's product.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ... -3’`\n        *   Compared to the intact gene, there are multiple changes starting at position 7 (`C`->`T`), 8 (`T`->`A`), etc. Or, it could be interpreted as a frameshift (an insertion or deletion). For instance, if a single `T` was inserted after the second codon: `ATG TTT TCT CGC TGG T...`. This would shift the reading frame. However, the sequence in Mutant 2 presents a much clearer and more definitive outcome.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... -3’`\n        *   Comparing to the intact sequence (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon is missing in Mutant 4 (`...GCT ACT...`).\n        *   Translation: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - **[Missing Gly]** - Thr ... (It also has a silent change in the 3rd codon from CTC to TTA based on a more complex alignment, but the main effect is the deletion).\n        *   **Result:** This is an in-frame deletion. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) but the rest of the sequence will be correct. The protein may retain some or all of its function.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the protein sequence. This will lead to the production of a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide instead of the full protein, definitively eliminating the function of the gene and thus the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. This is the most reliable and drastic change among the given options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
