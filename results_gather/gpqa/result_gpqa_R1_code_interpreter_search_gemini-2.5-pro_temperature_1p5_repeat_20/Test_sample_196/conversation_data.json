    "**1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data to Identify Compound X**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent, which must be electron-donating (an alkyl group).\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (9H total):**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment (an ethyl group part).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-). Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this -CH₂- is adjacent to the -CH₃. It is also adjacent to another group, making its signal a multiplet.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton indicates a methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic, hence the ~2.9 ppm shift). It is adjacent to the -CH₃ group at 1.4 ppm (causing it to be split) and the -CH₂- group at 1.7 ppm (causing further splitting), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Putting the pieces together (`-CH-` attached to the ring, with a `-CH₃` and a `-CH₂CH₃` also attached to this `-CH-`) gives the following structure: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:**\n    Based on all the data, Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a *para* arrangement. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Compound X, which we identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is well-known for the complete reduction of several oxygen-containing functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   **Transformation:** The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group, being an alkane substituent, will not be affected by these reagents.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\n*   Starting with 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the -COOH group is converted to a -CH₃ group.\n*   The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged. (Note: standard nomenclature would now number the sec-butyl group as position 1).\n*   The final product is a benzene ring substituted with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in a para-relationship.\n*   The name of this product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our predicted product with the given choices:\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **This matches our predicted product.**\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl group.\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect. This is a carboxylic acid, not a fully reduced product.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material, Compound X.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
