    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Process:**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay (a cascade) of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n\n    The process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{1st transition}} |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{2nd transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:**\n    For an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for emission (decay), $n$ must decrease.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First Transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$\n        *   Initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l_i = 1$.\n        *   Initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   For decay, $n_i$ must be less than 3.\n        *   So the intermediate state must be of the form $|n_i, 1, m_i\\rangle$ with $n_i=2$ or $n_i=1$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   The final state has $l'=0$. The intermediate state must have $l_i=1$ to satisfy $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$. This confirms our finding from the first transition.\n        *   If the intermediate state had $n_i=1$ (i.e., $|1,1,m_i\\rangle$), this state does not exist in the hydrogen atom model, as for a given $n$, $l$ can only range from $0$ to $n-1$.\n        *   Therefore, the only possible principal quantum number for the intermediate state is $n_i=2$.\n        *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n        *   The transition from any of these $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the selection rules ($\\Delta l=-1$, $\\Delta m = -m_i$).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This refers to the branching ratio for that path among all possible cascade paths from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The overall process probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n    *   **Step 1 Probability:** Branching ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_i\\rangle$.\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a $3s$ state) is spherically symmetric. This means there is no preferred direction in space. When the atom decays, the emitted photon can be in any direction with any allowed polarization. As a result, the atom is equally likely to be left in any of the degenerate sublevels of the final p-state. The three states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ (the $2p$ sublevels) are degenerate in the absence of external fields.\n        Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any one of these three states is the same.\n        *   Probability($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$) = $P_1$\n        *   Probability($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$) = $P_2$\n        *   Probability($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$) = $P_3$\n        Due to spherical symmetry, $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n        Since these are the only possible outcomes for the first decay step (assuming decay to $n=2$ is dominant, which it is), the sum of probabilities is 1.\n        $P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1 \\implies 3P = 1 \\implies P = 1/3$.\n        So, the branching ratio for the decay to any specific $m_i$ state is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Step 2 Probability:** Branching ratio for $|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        Once the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ states, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only state with $n=1$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. A decay from $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the dipole selection rules. There are no other lower-lying states it can decay to via an E1 transition. Thus, the branching ratio for this second step is 100% or 1.\n\n5.  **Combine Probabilities and Conclude:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of its steps.\n    *   Path A: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        Probability = (Prob. of step 1) $\\times$ (Prob. of step 2) = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    This matches option A. Let's check the other options for consistency.\n    *   Path B: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. The probability for this path would also be $\\frac{1}{3}$. Option B states $\\frac{1}{4}$, which is incorrect.\n    *   Path C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. The probability for this path would also be $\\frac{1}{3}$. Option C states $\\frac{1}{4}$, which is incorrect.\n    *   Path D: Same path as A, but the probability is given as $\\frac{2}{3}$, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the only correct combination of route and probability listed is in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
