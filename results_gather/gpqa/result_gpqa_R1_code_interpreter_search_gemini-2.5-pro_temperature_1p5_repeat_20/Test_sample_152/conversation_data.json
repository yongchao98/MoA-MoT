These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ group flanked by two esters) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate,⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester. The resulting intermediate is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent on the α-carbon.\n    1.  **Attack:**  ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ attacks the β-carbon.\n    2.  **Product Formation:** A new C-C bond forms between the malonate carbon and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The α-carbon gets a hydrogen.\n        *   Product Structure: p-tolyl-CH[CH(COOCH₃)₂]-CH₂-COOCH₃. This can be drawn as (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃.\n*   **Naming Product (A):** This structure can be named systematically, though the common name provided in the options is a bit tricky. Let's analyze the name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   This name considers a three-carbon chain as the backbone, connecting the three carboxylate functionalities.\n    *   **C1:** The malonate carbon, `CH(COOCH₃)₂`. It has two ester groups (hence `1,1-`).\n    *   **C2:** The β-carbon from the acrylate, `CH(p-tolyl)`. It has the p-tolyl substituent (hence `2-(p-tolyl)`).\n    *   **C3:** The α-carbon from the acrylate, which becomes a `CH₂` group. The original ester of the acrylate is now attached to this position (hence `3-tricarboxylate`).\n    *   Connecting these gives `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOCH₃`. This structure matches the one derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (a variant of Michael Addition).\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The β-carbon to the nitrogen (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is the nucleophilic center.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). The structure is CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  An acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product Formation (B):**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring is regenerated.\n    *   A new substituent is attached at the α-position (C2) of the cyclohexanone.\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: the `CH₃-CH` group is attacked, and the `CH-CN` is protonated, yielding a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` chain.\n    *   The final product is cyclohexanone with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n*   **Naming Product (B):** The principal functional group is the nitrile (CN). The main chain is a butanenitrile. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on carbon 3 of the nitrile chain. The substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product after acidic workup, not the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition (working backwards).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (Methyl Vinyl Ketone, MVK). Structure: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Mechanism (Retro-Michael):** A Michael addition involves forming a bond between a nucleophile (from reactant C) and the β-carbon of the acceptor (MVK).\n    *   The fragment added from MVK is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃`. This is a `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   The product name shows this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` molecule.\n    *   The C2 position of a 1,3-dione (`-CO-CH₂-CO-`) is highly acidic. In the presence of a base (KOH), it is readily deprotonated to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Identifying Reactant (C):** The nucleophile that adds to MVK must be the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   Therefore, the starting reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMatching the identified compounds with the given options:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
