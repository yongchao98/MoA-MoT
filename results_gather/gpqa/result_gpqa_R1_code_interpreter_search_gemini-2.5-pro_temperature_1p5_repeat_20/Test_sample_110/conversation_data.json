    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products A and B.\n\n### Reaction 1: Synthesis of Product A\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and bulky base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then act as a nucleophile and attack the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   The bulky base, t-BuOK, will abstract the only available α-proton from C6. This forms a regioselective enolate at the C1-C6 position. The nucleophilic carbon will be C6.\n\n     \n\n2.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate anion (nucleophile at C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   The C6 of the cyclohexanone ring forms a new carbon-carbon bond with the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A subsequent protonation step (e.g., from t-butanol formed in the first step or during aqueous workup) neutralizes the intermediate enolate formed from the acrylate moiety.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the parent chain is the ethyl propanoate part.\n    *   The parent chain is `...-CH₂(3)-CH₂(2)-COO(1)Et`.\n    *   At position 3, there is a large cyclohexyl substituent. We must name this substituent.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment (C1'). This carbon corresponds to the original C6 of the ketone.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at C1' (the original methyl group at C6).\n        *   An oxo group (=O) at C2' (the original carbonyl group at C1).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C3' (the original substituents at C2).\n    *   Combining these gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: Synthesis of Product B\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile).\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water (H₂O).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The protons on the carbon alpha to the nitro group are acidic. KOH will deprotonate the 1-nitropropane to form a carbanion, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base, KOH, removes a proton from the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n     \n\n2.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The β-carbon is the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the C1 of 1-nitropropane and the C3 (β-carbon) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Subsequent protonation (from water) gives the final product.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is named as a nitrile.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon. The chain is 6 carbons long: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   `C(6)H₃-C(5)H₂-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(2)H₂-C(1)N`\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Listing them alphabetically, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (B is incorrect)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Both A and B are correct**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (A is incorrect)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Both A and B are incorrect)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
