    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an alpha-bromination of acetic acid. Acetic acid itself does not readily enolize, but the conditions provided facilitate this. This is analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n*   CH3COOH + Br2 --(pyridine, (CH3CO)2O, heat)--> BrCH2COOH + HBr\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H2SO4, heat)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is an excellent nucleophile, and the bromine atom on the primary carbon is a good leaving group.\n*   BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN --> NCCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation, followed by cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes the acidic proton on the carbon atom between the nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups.\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH --> Na+[NC-CH-COOEt] + H2\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion is a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br(CH2)5Br --> NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization:** The product from the first alkylation still has an acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. Since NaH is in excess, this proton is also removed.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH --> Na+[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br] + H2\n        The newly formed carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain. This forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n        [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]- --> cyclization\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n      CN\n      |\n C1 --COOCH2CH3\n /  \\\nCH2--CH2\n|    |\nCH2--CH2\n \\  /\n  CH2\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n1.  **Chirality:** Carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOEt, -CH2- of the ring (path one), and -CH2- of the ring (path two). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral. Since it is synthesized from achiral precursors without a chiral catalyst, it will exist as a racemic mixture. The 1H NMR spectrum of a racemate is identical to that of a single enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Chemical Equivalence:** In a chiral molecule, there are no planes of symmetry or centers of inversion. This has important consequences for the equivalence of protons:\n    *   **Ethyl group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH2-) group are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. They are not chemically equivalent. They will produce **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   Because C1 is a chiral center and the two substituents on it (-CN and -COOEt) are different, the two sides of the ring are not equivalent. This means C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5. C4 is unique. So we have five distinct CH2 groups in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).\n        *   Within each of these five CH2 groups, the two geminal protons (e.g., axial and equatorial in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic because the molecule is chiral. They cannot be interconverted by any symmetry operation.\n        *   Therefore, each of the five CH2 groups on the ring should ideally give rise to two distinct signals. This would mean 5 x 2 = 10 signals from the ring protons.\n\n3.  **Total Theoretical Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals.\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 10 signals.\n    *   **Total = 3 + 10 = 13 distinct signals.**\n\n4.  **Reconciliation with Options:**\n    The theoretical number of signals is 13, which is not among the options (A=12, B=10, C=8, D=5). This implies that some protons are \"accidentally equivalent\" (isochronous), meaning their chemical shifts are so similar that they are not resolved into separate signals. Accidental equivalence is more likely for protons that are further away from the chiral center.\n\n    Let's rank the ring protons by their distance (number of bonds) from the chiral center C1:\n    *   H on C2/C6: 2 bonds away.\n    *   H on C3/C5: 3 bonds away.\n    *   H on C4: 4 bonds away.\n\n    The diastereotopic effect is weakest for the protons that are furthest from the chiral center. Therefore, the geminal protons on C4 are the most likely pair to be accidentally equivalent.\n\n    Let's assume this single, most plausible simplification:\n    *   The geminal protons on C4 are accidentally equivalent and produce only **1 signal** instead of 2.\n    *   All other protons remain chemically distinct as per the theoretical analysis.\n\n    Now, let's recount the signals with this assumption:\n    *   CH3: 1 signal\n    *   OCH2: 2 signals (diastereotopic)\n    *   C2 protons: 2 signals (geminal pair non-equivalent)\n    *   C6 protons: 2 signals (geminal pair non-equivalent, distinct from C2)\n    *   C3 protons: 2 signals (geminal pair non-equivalent)\n    *   C5 protons: 2 signals (geminal pair non-equivalent, distinct from C3)\n    *   C4 protons: 1 signal (geminal pair assumed accidentally equivalent)\n\n    Total signals = 1 (CH3) + 2 (OCH2) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C6) + 2 (C3) + 2 (C5) + 1 (C4) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis number matches option A. This line of reasoning involves applying the rules of stereochemistry rigorously and then making the single most minimal and physically reasonable approximation to match the given choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
