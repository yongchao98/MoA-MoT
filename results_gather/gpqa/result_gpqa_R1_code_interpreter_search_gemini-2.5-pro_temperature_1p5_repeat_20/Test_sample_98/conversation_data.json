    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid dimer.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides the most crucial information for determining the specific structure.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This means there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so they are all consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This indicates a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, `d`).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a triplet, `t`).\n    *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (giving a quartet, `q`).\n    For this to occur, a `CH` group must be adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This indicates a different single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, `d`).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (giving one triplet, `t`).\n    *   A second group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving another triplet, `t`).\n    For this to occur, a `CH` group must be adjacent to a `CH` group and two non-equivalent `CH₂` groups.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Structure\n\nLet's evaluate each candidate molecule to see if its structure can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. We will number the carbon chain starting from the `COOH` as C1.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   The proton on C3 (H-3) is adjacent to H-2 (1H), the C4-H₂ group (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). Its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to a `CH` group and two `CH₂` groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`(CH₃)₂CH(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   The proton on C3 (H-3) is adjacent to H-4 (1H), the C2-H₂ group (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). Its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n*   Like structure A, there is no proton that could produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   Let's analyze the proton on C3 (H-3). It is adjacent to H-4 (1H), the C2-H₂ group (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its signal would be split into a doublet by H-4, a triplet by the C2-H₂ group, and another triplet by the ethyl `CH₂`. This results in a **dtt** signal. This matches Signal 2.\n*   Now let's analyze the proton on C4 (H-4). It is adjacent to H-3 (1H), the C5-H₃ methyl group (3H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its signal would be split into a doublet by H-3, a quartet by the C5-H₃ group, and a triplet by the ethyl `CH₂`. This results in a **dqt** (doublet of quartets of triplets) signal. A `dqt` is a highly complex multiplet with 24 lines, just like a `dtq`, and is the only possible source for this type of complex splitting in the given options that also has a `dtt`. It is very plausible that `dqt` is reported as `dtq`.\n*   Since this structure produces both a `dtt` and a `dqt` (reported as `dtq`), it matches all the NMR data.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₂CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   The proton on C3 (H-3) is adjacent to H-2 (1H), the C4-H₂ group (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its signal would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n*   However, there is no proton in this structure that is adjacent to a `CH`, a `CH₂`, and a `CH₃` group. Therefore, it cannot produce the required `dtq` signal.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nOnly structure C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can give rise to both a `dtt` signal (from H-3) and a highly complex `dqt` signal (from H-4) which is reported as a `dtq`. Therefore, compound C is the unknown product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
