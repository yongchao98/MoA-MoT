    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the variables and relationships:**\n    *   Let `N` be the number of stars.\n    *   Let `plx` be the parallax.\n    *   Let `r` be the distance.\n    *   The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars per unit parallax interval (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n        *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) = k * plx⁻⁵` for some constant `k`.\n\n2.  **Identify the goal:**\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) depends on the distance `r`.\n\n3.  **Establish the connection between parallax and distance:**\n    *   Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance.\n        *   `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule for derivatives to change variables:**\n    *   We want to find `dN/dr`. We know `dN/d(plx)`. The chain rule connects these:\n        *   `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the necessary derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    *   Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can take the derivative with respect to `r`.\n        *   `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute the known relationships into the chain rule equation:**\n    *   Substitute `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵` and `d(plx)/dr = -1/r²` into the chain rule formula.\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²) `\n\n7.  **Express the entire relationship in terms of `r`:**\n    *   Now, substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression.\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-1/r²) `\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²) `\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ -r⁵ / r² `\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ -r³ `\n\n8.  **Interpret the final proportionality:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r³`. The negative sign just indicates the direction of change relative to the variables, but the magnitude of the dependence is on `r³`. The question asks how the number of stars *changes with* distance, which refers to this proportionality.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes as `r³`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
