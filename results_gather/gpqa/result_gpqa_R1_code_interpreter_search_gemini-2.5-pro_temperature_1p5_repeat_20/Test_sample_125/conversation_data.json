    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH₂(C=O)CH₂CH(OCH₃)CH₃.\n    *   It has one stereocenter at C5, and its configuration is given as (S). This means the starting material is a single enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:** 1) LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), 2) Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since the reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3 in a molecule that already has a stereocenter at C5, two diastereomers will be formed. The configuration at C5 remains (S). The new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃(C=O)CH₂(C=O)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), 2) Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols since it is used in excess. The reaction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol, CH₃CH(OH)CH₂(OH)CH₃.\n    *   Because the starting molecule is symmetric with respect to the two new stereocenters, we need to check for meso compounds.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n    *   Product 2A: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Product 2B: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These two are enantiomers. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed as a racemic mixture (equal amounts).\n    *   Product 2C: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot separate enantiomers, but it can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   **Mixture composition:** The combined mixture contains five different compounds:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The enantiomers themselves are not separable by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak. This results in **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They have different molecular formulas, different carbon skeletons, and different functional group arrangements (one alcohol and one ether vs. two alcohols). Their polarities will be significantly different, so they will be easily separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each group of products, assuming no accidental co-elution.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate stereoisomers, including enantiomers. It interacts differently with each stereoisomer.\n*   **Mixture composition:** The flask contains five distinct stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Separation:** Since all five compounds are chemically distinct stereoisomers, and a chiral column is designed to resolve such molecules, we can assume that each compound will have a unique retention time.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** We expect to see one peak for each of the five stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n    *   Total Peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
