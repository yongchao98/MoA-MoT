    "This problem can be solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (τ) is approximately equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n    ΔE ⋅ τ ≈ ħ\n\n*   **Energy Uncertainty (Natural Linewidth):** From this principle, we can find the minimum uncertainty in the energy of each state, which is often called the natural linewidth.\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n*   **Values Needed:**\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   Lifetime of the first state (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of the second state (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n*   **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:**\n    *   For the first state:\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   For the second state:\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Condition for Resolvability:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths). Specifically, the separation must be larger than the *larger* of the two linewidths. This is because if the separation is smaller than the width of the broader level, the two energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n\n    The larger of the two energy uncertainties is ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    Therefore, the condition for the energy levels to be resolved is:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:** Now we check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap too much.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be clearly distinct.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only energy difference that is sufficiently large to allow the two states to be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar = 6.582119569e-16 # eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9 # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8 # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using Delta_E = h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (tau = {tau1} s): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (tau = {tau2} s): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\n\n# To be resolvable, the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties.\nlarger_uncertainty = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\nprint(f\"The required energy difference must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is {larger_uncertainty:.4e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-8,\n    'B': 1e-4,\n    'C': 1e-11,\n    'D': 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > larger_uncertainty:\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {value:.1e} eV is large enough to be resolved.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {value:.1e} eV is NOT large enough to be resolved.\")\n\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem about resolving two quantum energy levels.\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The problem involves lifetimes of quantum states and their energy levels. This points directly to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relating energy and time. The specific form is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where Δt is the lifetime (τ) and ΔE is the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the state, also known as the natural linewidth.\n\n2.  **Formulate the condition for resolution:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguished,\" the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths). If the energy difference is smaller than the linewidths, the two energy distributions will overlap significantly, making them indistinguishable. A common criterion (like the Rayleigh criterion for optical resolution) is that the separation must be at least as large as the width of the levels. Since the two levels have different lifetimes, they will have different energy widths. To resolve them, the separation must be larger than the *broader* of the two linewidths.\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy uncertainties (linewidths):**\n    *   The formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n    *   The reduced Planck constant, ħ, is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   For state 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   For state 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n4.  **Determine the required energy separation:**\n    *   The two linewidths are ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE₂ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   The broader linewidth is ΔE₁, as it corresponds to the shorter lifetime.\n    *   Therefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁.\n    *   So, we need |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV. This is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (1 × 10⁻⁸ < 65.8 × 10⁻⁸). Not resolvable.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV. This is larger than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (1000 × 10⁻⁷ > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷). Resolvable.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV. This is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV. This is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (0.1 × 10⁻⁸ < 6.58 × 10⁻⁸). Not resolvable.\n\n6.  **Confirm with the code output:** The code performed these exact calculations.\n    *   `delta_E1`: 6.5821e-07 eV\n    *   `delta_E2`: 6.5821e-08 eV\n    *   The larger uncertainty is 6.5821e-07 eV.\n    *   The code correctly identifies that only option B (1e-4 eV) is greater than this required minimum separation.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The reasoning and calculations are sound. The code confirms the manual calculation. The final answer is B. The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
