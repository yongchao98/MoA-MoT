    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule containing the most abundant isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n*   **M⁺+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158, with a relative intensity of 32% compared to the M⁺ peak (100%), is a crucial clue. This M⁺/(M⁺+2) intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 is the characteristic isotopic signature for a compound containing a single **chlorine** atom (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's check the molecular formulas of the given options. All options (Phenyl chloroformate, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the molecular formula **C₇H₅ClO₂**.\nThe molecular weight for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\nThis matches the mass spectrometry data, so we must use the other spectra to distinguish between these isomers.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid** that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The peak is exceptionally broad.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) region and its position is characteristic of a carbonyl in a conjugated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) is strongly indicated. This eliminates option **A (Phenyl chloroformate)**, which is an ester and would lack the broad O-H peak, and option **D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde)**, which is an aldehyde and a phenol. While a phenol has an O-H group, its IR absorption is typically not as broad as described (3500-2700 cm⁻¹).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, in the region characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). Its integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment. This further supports the elimination of options A and D.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We are left with two signals in the aromatic region:\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)**\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**\n*   **Interpretation:** The aromatic region shows only two signals, each representing two equivalent protons (2H). This high degree of symmetry, resulting in a pattern of two doublets, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n    *   Let's compare this to the remaining options, B and C.\n    *   **Option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is a *para*-substituted molecule. The two protons next to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the chlorine are also equivalent. This symmetry would produce exactly two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This matches the data perfectly.\n    *   **Option C (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted molecule. All four protons on the benzene ring are in chemically different environments. This would result in four distinct signals, each for 1H, with more complex splitting patterns. This is inconsistent with the observed data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combination of all spectral data points definitively to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n*   **MS:** Confirms molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR and ¹H NMR (11.0 ppm):** Confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR (aromatic region):** The \"two doublets, 2H each\" pattern confirms a *para*-substitution on the benzene ring.\n\nThus, the unknown solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
