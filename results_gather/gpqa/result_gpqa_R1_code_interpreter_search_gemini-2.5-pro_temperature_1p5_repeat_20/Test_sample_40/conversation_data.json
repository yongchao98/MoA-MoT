    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, as it deals with the speed of light in a moving medium.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n\n*   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n*   **Glass's Rest Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass. It moves at a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n\n**2. Identify the Velocities:**\n\n*   **Velocity of the medium (glass):** The glass is moving with velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam, as observed from the laboratory frame (S). So, the velocity of frame S' relative to S is `v`.\n*   **Speed of light in the glass's rest frame (u'):** The index of refraction `n` tells us the speed of light *within the medium*. In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is `u' = c/n`. Given that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, we have `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **Speed of light relative to the observer (u):** This is the speed of light as measured in the laboratory frame (S), which is what we need to find.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n\nThe formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction in special relativity is:\n\n`u = (v + u') / (1 + v*u' / c^2)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `u` is the final velocity in the stationary frame (S).\n*   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to S.\n*   `u'` is the velocity in the moving frame (S').\n*   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values:**\n\nSubstitute the values from our problem into the formula:\n*   `v` = `v`\n*   `u'` = `1/n`\n*   `c` = `1`\n\n`u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v * (1/n) / 1^2)`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression:**\n\n`u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo get rid of the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n\n`u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n`u = (n*v + n*(1/n)) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n`u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\nRearranging the terms in the numerator gives:\n\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
