    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of the specified proton.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. This is a high-temperature reaction with a strong base on a tertiary dihalide. Direct E2 elimination is impossible at the bridgehead positions due to Bredt's rule. The reaction likely proceeds through a carbocation intermediate (SN1-like), followed by rearrangement, which is common in adamantane chemistry. The stoichiometry of replacing two -Br atoms and losing an H₂O molecule to form a carbonyl (C=O) gives the product formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Product 1 Information:**\n    *   Formula: C₁₀H₁₄O. Degrees of Unsaturation = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4. This corresponds to a tricyclic skeleton (3 degrees) and one carbonyl group (1 degree).\n    *   IR Spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹. This confirms the presence of a ketone, likely in a six-membered ring or a slightly strained environment.\n    *   ¹H NMR Spectrum: The reported spectrum (4.79 ppm for 2H) is unusual for a simple saturated ketone and suggests a complex structure. However, we can proceed by identifying the most plausible chemical transformation.\n*   **Plausible Structure:** A well-known rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton under acidic or harsh hydrolytic conditions leads to the protoadamantane skeleton. The likely product is **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). This structure fits the molecular formula (C₁₀H₁₄O) and has a ketone group consistent with the IR data. We will proceed with this hypothesis, as the subsequent steps are standard reactions that will lead to a predictable final product.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   This reaction is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of the ketone to an alcohol. The ketone **1** (C₁₀H₁₄O) is reduced to the corresponding alcohol, protoadamantan-4-ol (C₁₀H₁₆O).\n*   The problem states that Product **2** is then subjected to ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that Product **2** is an alkene, not the alcohol.\n*   The \"heating\" mentioned in the reaction conditions likely causes a subsequent **dehydration** of the intermediate alcohol to form an alkene.\n*   **Dehydration of Protoadamantan-4-ol:** Elimination of water can form a double bond. Elimination of the proton from the bridgehead C3 is disfavored. Elimination of a proton from the methylene C5 position is much more likely.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The dehydration product is **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). The formula is C₁₀H₁₄.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** Ozonolysis cleaves the C4=C5 double bond of protoadamant-4-ene, forming two carbonyl groups. This cleavage opens one of the rings of the tricyclic system.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-ene is a known reaction that yields **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n    *   This molecule has a nine-carbon bicyclic framework with bridgehead carbons at C1 and C5.\n    *   There are two symmetrical three-carbon bridges (C1-C2-C3-C4-C5 and C1-C8-C7-C6-C5) and one one-carbon bridge (C1-C9-C5).\n    *   The two ketone groups are located at positions C3 and C7.\n    *   The molecule is highly symmetrical (C₂v point group), assuming a preferred double-chair conformation, which is possible due to the sp² hybridization at C3 and C7 removing steric hindrance.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Product 3:** bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   **Identify the most deshielded proton:**\n    *   The molecule has three types of protons: bridgehead protons (at C1, C5), protons alpha to the carbonyls (at C2, C4, C6, C8), and protons on the C9 bridge.\n    *   The α-protons are typically at δ 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n    *   The bridgehead protons (H1 and H5) are beta to *two* carbonyl groups, which causes significant deshielding. Their chemical shift is around δ 3.1 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, the **most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons, H1 and H5.**\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern of the bridgehead proton (H1):**\n    *   H1 is vicinally coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons: C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   There are two protons on C2, two on C8, and two on C9, for a total of 6 neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the couplings can be simplified:\n        *   The two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two on C8.\n        *   Within each CH₂ group (e.g., C2), the two protons (axial-like, H2ax, and equatorial-like, H2eq) are diastereotopic and have different couplings to H1.\n    *   The coupling constant (J) depends on the dihedral angle (Karplus relationship).\n        *   **Coupling to H2ax and H8ax:** The dihedral angle is ~180° (anti-periplanar), leading to a large coupling constant (J_ax ≈ 10-13 Hz). H1 couples to these two equivalent protons.\n        *   **Coupling to H9ax:** This proton is also in an axial-like position relative to H1. The dihedral angle is also close to 180°, leading to another large coupling constant, J_9ax. Because the C9 bridge is structurally different from the C2/C8 bridges, we can expect J_9ax to be different from J_ax.\n        *   **Coupling to Equatorial Protons (H2eq, H8eq, H9eq):** The dihedral angles are ~60°, leading to small coupling constants (J_eq ≈ 2-5 Hz). In a first-order analysis for predicting the main pattern, these small couplings are often ignored or are unresolved.\n    *   **Applying the Simplification:** Let's ignore the small couplings to the three equatorial protons. H1 is coupled to the three axial-like protons: H2ax, H8ax, and H9ax.\n        *   The protons H2ax and H8ax are equivalent by symmetry. Coupling to these two protons will split the H1 signal into a **triplet** (n+1 rule, where n=2).\n        *   The proton H9ax is not equivalent to H2ax/H8ax. Coupling to this single proton will split the triplet further into **doublets**.\n    *   **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets** (or a triplet of doublets, depending on the relative magnitudes of J_ax and J_9ax).\n\n*   **Matching with Options:**\n    *   A) triplet of triplets\n    *   B) doublet of triplets\n    *   C) triplet\n    *   D) pentet\n\nThe deduced pattern, \"doublet of triplets,\" matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
