    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves a particle annihilation process, which must obey the fundamental laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the resulting particles are moving at high speeds, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation. In relativity, the total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy ($mc^2$) and its kinetic energy ($K$).\n    $E_{total} = E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after.\n    $\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_{final}$\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy $E$ of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving.\" In the context of particle physics annihilations, this is typically interpreted to mean its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy.\n*   Assuming the proton is the stationary target particle, the total initial momentum is very close to zero. We can simplify the problem by considering the annihilation to happen in the center-of-mass frame, where the total initial momentum is exactly zero and both particles have negligible kinetic energy.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass of a proton is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton. The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   All four particles have the same rest mass, given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. To conserve momentum, the four final particles must move away from the point of annihilation in such a way that their vector momenta sum to zero.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the problem and the conservation of energy, the total initial energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n*   Let $E_A$ be the total energy of a single particle A. The total final energy is:\n\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy and Solve for Velocity**\n\n*   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n*   Solve for the total energy of one particle A ($E_A$):\n    $E_A = \\frac{2 \\times m_p c^2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} m_p c^2$\n\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical value of $E_A$:\n    $E_A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (938.3 \\text{ MeV}) = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   We can now find the velocity of particle A using the relativistic energy equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$. First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n*   Finally, we solve for the velocity $v$ from the definition of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n*   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n*   The velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\n\n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# Calculate the total initial energy from the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton at rest\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# The final energy is distributed equally among the 4 final particles (2A+ and 2A-)\nE_A = E_initial / 4\n\n# The total energy of a single particle A is E_A = gamma * m_A_c2. We can find gamma.\ngamma = E_A / m_A_c2\n\n# From gamma, we can find the velocity v.\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) => v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"{v_over_c=:.3f}\")\n```\n```output\nv_over_c=0.769\n```\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**1. Identify the physical principles:**\nThe problem describes a particle-antiparticle annihilation. The key principles governing this process are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the resulting particles will be moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use the equations of special relativity.\n\n**2. Analyze the initial state (before annihilation):**\n*   The initial particles are a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume the system is effectively at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\n*   The total momentum before the collision is therefore considered to be zero.\n*   The total energy before the collision ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton. The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is:\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Analyze the final state (after annihilation):**\n*   The final products are four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All these particles have the same rest mass $m_A$.\n*   The rest mass energy of particle A is given: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   By the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the problem, the total initial energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n*   Let $E_A$ be the total relativistic energy of a single particle A. The total final energy is:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n**4. Apply the conservation of energy:**\n*   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n*   Solve for the total energy of one particle A:\n    $E_A = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**5. Calculate the velocity:**\n*   The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   We can first solve for $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Now, we solve the Lorentz factor equation for the velocity $v$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n*   The velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
