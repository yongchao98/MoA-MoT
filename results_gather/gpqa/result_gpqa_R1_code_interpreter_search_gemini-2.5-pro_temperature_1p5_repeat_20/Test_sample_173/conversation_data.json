    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are told one fragment is \"2 times more massive\" than the other. This is interpreted as `m1 = 2 * m2`. We'll denote `m1` as the more massive fragment.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe Q-value is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T1 + T2`).\n\n`Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n`Q = 3000 MeV` (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn this approximation, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the final total momentum must be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n*   **Relating Kinetic Energies:**\n    `T1_cl = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n    `T2_cl = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n    From these, we can form a ratio:\n    `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2 * m1)) / (p^2 / (2 * m2)) = m2 / m1`\n    Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2`.\n    So, `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   **Solving for T1_cl:**\n    The total kinetic energy is `Q = T1_cl + T2_cl`.\n    `3000 MeV = T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 * T1_cl`\n    `T1_cl = 3000 MeV / 3 = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1\n\nFor the relativistic case, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where `E = T + mc^2` is the total energy.\n\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   Energy: `E1 + E2 = M*c^2`\n    *   Momentum: `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n*   **Relating Energies:**\n    From the energy-momentum relation, `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`. Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n    `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    Substitute `E2 = M*c^2 - E1` from energy conservation:\n    `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (M*c^2 - E1)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (M*c^2)^2 - 2*E1*(M*c^2) + E1^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    Cancel `E1^2` from both sides and solve for `E1`:\n    `2*E1*(M*c^2) = (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    `E1 = [ (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (M*c^2) ]`\n*   **Solving for E1 and T1:**\n    Plug in the energy values in GeV:\n    `E1 = [ (300)^2 + (198)^2 - (99)^2 ] / [ 2 * 300 ]`\n    `E1 = [ 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ] / 600`\n    `E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n    The kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n    `T1_rel = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n    `T1_rel = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_cl`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Define initial parameters in GeV\nM_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest mass energies of fragments in GeV\nm1_c2 = 0.66 * M_c2\nm2_c2 = 0.33 * M_c2\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy released (Q-value) in GeV\nQ_GeV = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# Calculate classical T1 in GeV\n# Q = T1_cl + T2_cl and T1_cl/T2_cl = m2/m1 = 1/2 => T2_cl = 2*T1_cl\n# Q = 3 * T1_cl\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV / 3.0\n\n# Calculate relativistic E1 in GeV\nE1_GeV = (M_c2**2 + m1_c2**2 - m2_c2**2) / (2 * M_c2)\n\n# Calculate relativistic T1 in GeV\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1_GeV - m1_c2\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV) * 1000\n\nprint(f'{difference_MeV=}')\n```",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define Variables and Knowns\n*   Initial nucleus rest mass: M\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest.\n*   It splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Let `m1` be the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is `T1`.\n*   The goal is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) `T1` and the `T1` calculated using the classical approximation (`T1_cl`).\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\nFirst, we solve the system of equations for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `E_m1 = m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `E_m2 = m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T1 + T2`).\n`Q = E_M - (E_m1 + E_m2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nSo, `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV = 3000 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate `T1` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum be `p`.\n    `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** In this approximation, `T_cl = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Relating the Kinetic Energies:**\n    `T1_cl = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n    `T2_cl = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n    Taking the ratio: `T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = (0.33 * M) / (0.66 * M) = 1/2`.\n    This means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   **Solving for `T1_cl`:**\n    We know the total kinetic energy is `Q = T1_cl + T2_cl`.\n    `3000 MeV = T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl)`\n    `3000 MeV = 3 * T1_cl`\n    `T1_cl = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate `T1` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   Energy: `E1 + E2 = M*c^2`. `E` is the *total* energy (`E = T + mc^2`).\n    *   Momentum: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n    This can be rearranged to `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`.\n*   **Solving for Energy:** Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n    `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n    `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    From conservation of energy, `E2 = M*c^2 - E1`. Substitute this into the equation:\n    `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (M*c^2 - E1)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (M*c^2)^2 - 2*E1*(M*c^2) + E1^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    The `E1^2` terms cancel out. Rearrange to solve for `E1`:\n    `2*E1*(M*c^2) = (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n    `E1 = [ (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (M*c^2) ]`\n*   **Plugging in the values (in GeV):**\n    `E1 = [ (300)^2 + (198)^2 - (99)^2 ] / [ 2 * 300 ]`\n    `E1 = [ 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ] / 600`\n    `E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n*   **Finding the Relativistic Kinetic Energy `T1`:**\n    `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2`\n    `T1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n    `T1 = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n`Difference = T1 - T1_cl`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe code execution also confirms this result, yielding `difference_MeV=4.99999...`, which is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
