    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C from methyl, C from ethyl) lie in the same plane.\n    *   **Chirality**: This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry coinciding with the plane of the molecule itself. Therefore, it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex, bridged bicyclic compound. The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors: (3aR, 7aS) for two stereocenters at the ring fusion and (E) for the configuration of the exocyclic double bond (=CHCl).\n    *   **Chirality**: When a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is designated by R/S notation, it is, by definition, optically active. The complex structure with defined stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and an unsymmetrical substituent (=CHCl) is highly unlikely to possess any internal symmetry that would make it a meso compound. The explicit naming of a single stereoisomer implies it has been resolved or synthesized in an enantiomerically pure form.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, and thus it is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   **Chirality**: This molecule is a classic example used to illustrate the concept of meso compounds. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The (2R,3S) configuration (which is identical to 2S,3R) corresponds to the meso isomer.\n    *   We can see this by drawing its conformation. In an eclipsed conformation (looking down the C2-C3 bond), there is a plane of symmetry between the two carbons. In a staggered conformation (with COOH groups anti), there is a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound. It is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has the same connectivity but a different spatial arrangement.\n    *   **Chirality**: The (2R,3R) isomer does not have any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are not superimposable. A specific enantiomer like (2R,3R) will rotate plane-polarized light.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is a chiral molecule, and the single enantiomer specified is optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   **Chirality**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment -CH2-C6-, and 4) the ring segment -CH2-C2-. Tracing the paths around the ring from C1, one path immediately encounters a double bond (-C2-C3=C4-), while the other does not (-C6-C5-C4=). Thus, the two ring pathways are different, making C1 a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is therefore optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor (1s,3s,5s) or simply \"cis\" indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (e.g., all pointing up).\n    *   **Chirality**: If we consider the chair conformation where the three OH groups are all in axial positions (or all in equatorial positions), the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3). More importantly for chirality, it has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one carbon bearing an OH group and the opposite CH2 group on the ring (e.g., the plane containing C1 and C4). Because it possesses planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is an achiral molecule and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Chirality**: To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a stereocenter or another element of chirality. Let's check for stereocenters (a carbon with four different substituents).\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has no stereocenters.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon C=O is sp2 hybridized, not a stereocenter.\n        *   The -CH2- group has two identical hydrogens.\n        *   The -CH(CH3)2 group has a carbon bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups. Since two of the groups are identical, this is not a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other sources of chirality (like axial or planar chirality).\n    *   **Conclusion**: It is an achiral molecule and optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
