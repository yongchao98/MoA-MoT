    "An oscillating charge distribution is the source of electromagnetic radiation. If the size of the distribution is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation, it can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. A spheroidal charge distribution with a symmetry axis along the z-axis that oscillates will create an oscillating electric dipole moment along the z-axis.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` from an oscillating electric dipole with its moment aligned with the z-axis is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `C` is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment and the frequency of oscillation.\n*   `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\nThe radiation pattern is therefore determined by the `sin²(θ)` term.\n*   The power is zero along the axis of oscillation (`θ = 0°` and `θ = 180°`), as `sin(0) = sin(180) = 0`.\n*   The power is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation (`θ = 90°`), as `sin(90) = 1`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, which is given as `A` in the problem, occurs when `sin²(θ) = 1`. Thus, we can write:\n\n`A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * (1)² = C`\n\nSo, the power radiated at any angle `θ` can be expressed in terms of the maximum power `A`:\n\n`dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We can calculate this fraction as:\n\nFraction = `(dP/dΩ at θ=30°) / A`\nFraction = `(A * sin²(30°)) / A`\nFraction = `sin²(30°)`\n\nThe value of `sin(30°)` is `1/2`.\nTherefore, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThis result eliminates options B and C.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nNow, we need to determine how the radiated power depends on the wavelength `λ`. The radiated power from an oscillating dipole is strongly dependent on the frequency of oscillation. The power is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charges. For sinusoidal oscillation, the acceleration is proportional to the square of the angular frequency `ω`. Therefore, the radiated power is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n\nPower `∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is:\n\n`ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)`\n\nwhere `ν` is the frequency and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power:\n\nPower `∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, the radiated power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`, has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence. This is a classic result for dipole radiation, also seen in phenomena like Rayleigh scattering.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining our two findings:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n2.  The radiated power `f` has a dependence of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThese two results correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
