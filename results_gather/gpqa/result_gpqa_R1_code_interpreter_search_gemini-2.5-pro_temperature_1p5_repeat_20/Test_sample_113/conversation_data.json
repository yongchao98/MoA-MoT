    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a cyanohydrin formation. Butan-2-one is a ketone. In the presence of a cyanide source (NaCN), the cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  Nucleophilic attack: The CN⁻ ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O double bond and forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n            `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n        2.  Protonation: The negatively charged oxygen atom (alkoxide) needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. This requires a source of protons (H⁺).\n            `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source. This reaction is typically carried out in a weakly acidic solution or followed by an acidic workup. The H₃O⁺ ion (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acidic solution, which is an excellent proton source for this step. NaHSO₃ forms addition products with ketones but is not the reagent for the final protonation step in cyanohydrin synthesis.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The reactant is an α-hydroxy nitrile, and the product is an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and water, the nitrile is protonated, which makes the carbon atom more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. Through a series of steps, the nitrile is converted first to an amide intermediate and then to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong base (like NaOH), the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylate salt, which then requires an acidic workup to form the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis. Looking at the options, we have CH₃COOH (acetic acid, a weak acid) and HCl (hydrochloric acid, a strong acid). The hydrolysis of a nitrile is a slow reaction that requires harsh conditions, so a strong acid catalyst is necessary for the reaction to proceed efficiently. CH₃COOH is generally not strong enough.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be a strong acid, which is HCl. This eliminates option C.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis of Reaction 1, A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Based on the analysis of Reaction 2, B is HCl.\n    *   Combining these two conclusions, the correct choice is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
