    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to account for time dilation.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) is considered stationary.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S') is moving relative to the Galaxy.\n\n2.  **List the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame (frame S).\n\n3.  **Apply the concept of Time Dilation:**\n    *   An observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy, S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt'`). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n    *   First, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame.\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   Substituting the expression for `Δt`:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt')`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Let's group the known numbers:\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n7.  **Compute the final value:**\n    *   Now we need to calculate `sqrt(0.96)`.\n    *   I will use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Non-relativistic distance (for comparison)\nd_non_relativistic = v * delta_t_prime\n\n# Lorentz factor\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Time in Galaxy frame\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Distance in Galaxy frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"Non-relativistic distance: {d_non_relativistic} km\")\nprint(f\"Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma}\")\nprint(f\"Time in Galaxy frame (delta_t): {delta_t} s\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic distance: {distance} km\")\n```\n\nThe computed distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This is the incorrect non-relativistic answer)\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option B, 3,060,000 km. The small discrepancy (~0.06%) is likely due to rounding in the problem's values or the options. For example, if the Lorentz factor `γ` was intended to be approximated as 1.02, the calculation `1.02 * 60,000 * 50` gives exactly 3,060,000.\n\n**Conclusion:** The relativistic effect of time dilation causes the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame to be longer than 50 seconds, leading to a travel distance greater than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Option B is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** We can consider this the stationary frame of reference.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference, traveling at a high velocity `v` relative to the Galaxy.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame, `Δt' = 50 s`.
