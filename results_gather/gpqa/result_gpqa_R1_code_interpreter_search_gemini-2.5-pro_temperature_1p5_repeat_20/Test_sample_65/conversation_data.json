    "**Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the core of the question:** The question asks which fundamental symmetries *must* be respected by *all* operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). This means we need to identify the foundational assumptions upon which SMEFT is built.\n\n2.  **Define SMEFT:** SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators built from the SM fields. These operators are suppressed by a high energy scale, Î›. The crucial point is that SMEFT is a **local, relativistic quantum field theory**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate each symmetry:**\n\n    *   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** This is the symmetry of spacetime under rotations and boosts, a cornerstone of special relativity. Any relativistic quantum field theory, including the SM and its effective extension SMEFT, must be Lorentz invariant. This means the Lagrangian, which is the sum of the SM Lagrangian and all the SMEFT operator terms, must transform as a scalar under Lorentz transformations. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry **must be respected**.\n\n    *   **2. Poincare Symmetry:** This is the full symmetry group of spacetime in special relativity. It includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) *and* spacetime translations. The assumption of translational invariance (i.e., the laws of physics are the same everywhere in spacetime) is fundamental to constructing Lagrangians in particle physics. Invariance under the Poincare group is a foundational requirement for any relativistic QFT. Since SMEFT is a relativistic QFT, it **must respect Poincare symmetry**.\n\n    *   **3. CP Symmetry (Charge-Parity):** This symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry through the complex phase in the CKM matrix in the weak sector. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it not only incorporates the SM's CP violation but can also introduce new sources of CP violation through various higher-dimensional operators. In fact, searching for new sources of CP violation is a major goal of using SMEFT. Therefore, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n    *   **4. CPT Symmetry (Charge-Parity-Time):** The CPT theorem is one of the most fundamental results in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian will be invariant under the combined transformation of C, P, and T (time reversal). SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT. Therefore, by the CPT theorem, it **must respect CPT symmetry**. An operator that violates CPT would inherently violate Lorentz invariance.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the results:**\n    *   Must be respected: Lorentz Symmetry (1), Poincare Symmetry (2), CPT Symmetry (4).\n    *   Not required to be respected: CP Symmetry (3).\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 1,2 - Incorrect, as it omits the crucial CPT symmetry (4).\n    *   B) 1,3,4 - Incorrect, as it incorrectly includes CP symmetry (3).\n    *   C) 3,4 - Incorrect, as it incorrectly includes CP symmetry (3) and omits the fundamental spacetime symmetries (1 and 2).\n    *   D) 1,2,4 - Correct. This option includes all the required symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.\n\n<<<D>>>"
