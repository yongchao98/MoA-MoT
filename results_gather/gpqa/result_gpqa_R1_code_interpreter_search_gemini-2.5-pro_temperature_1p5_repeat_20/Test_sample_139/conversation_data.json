    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85°C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82°C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavier Isotope in X:** Since D₂O is involved, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the description of Substance X is **Deuterium (D)**, an isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. A molecule of W contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Let's test some simple gases.\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n        *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Incorrect)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 from each D), 2 neutrons (1 from each D). (Correct)\n    *   Thus, gas **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    *   The reaction of X and Y produces D₂ gas. Since X contains deuterium, it must be a deuteride compound. For D₂ to be produced, the other reactant, Y, must also be a source of deuterium. The most logical candidate for liquid Y is D₂O (the same as substance B).\n    *   The reaction of a deuteride with heavy water is violent. The clue \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards a common reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a prime candidate. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It releases D₂ gas (W), which matches our finding.\n    *   It forms two products in the solution: LiOD (soluble in D₂O) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide). Al(OD)₃ is the deuterium analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate. So, the precipitate **G is Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O, which is substance B.\n    *   All these points are consistent.\n\n5.  **Verify with the final clue:** The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms in the simplest structures (e.g., Pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n    *   R-CO-COOH (keto acid, 3 oxygens) --[1. LiAlD₄] / [2. Workup]--> R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH (a diol, 2 oxygens).\n    *   This reaction results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms, confirming our identification.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing the masses of all their atoms present in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the calculation, as is standard for such problems leading to integer answers.\n    *   Mass number of Deuterium (D) = 2.\n    *   Mass number of Aluminum's most stable isotope (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   There are 4 atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) in LiAlD₄. Their total mass is 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   There is 1 atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum) in LiAlD₄. Its mass is 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
