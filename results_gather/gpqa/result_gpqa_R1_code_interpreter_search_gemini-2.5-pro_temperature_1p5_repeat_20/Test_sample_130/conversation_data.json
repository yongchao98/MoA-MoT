    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic acid and anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride is characterized by:\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift (7 ppm) is in the vinylic (alkene) region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A value around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride, while a value around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C).\n    *   The high symmetry (one ¹H peak, two ¹³C peaks) and the cis-alkene origin strongly point to **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making its two alkene protons equivalent and its two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The two alkene carbons are also equivalent. This perfectly matches the NMR data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and its products.**\n\n*   **Reaction type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction forms a six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₄, and the dienophile is C₄H₂O₃. The product's molecular formula would be C₉₊₄H₁₄₊₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo):** Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The **Alder Endo Rule** states that the kinetically favored product is the *endo* isomer. This is usually the **major product**.\n    *   The *exo* isomer is thermodynamically more stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   The key structural difference between the *endo* and *exo* adducts of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride lies in the relative orientation of the anhydride ring with respect to the newly formed bicyclic system.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the alkene bridge (`-C(Me)=C(Me)-`). This places the protons on the anhydride part (let's call them Hα) in close spatial proximity to the methyl groups on the double bond.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side of) the alkene bridge. This places the Hα protons far away from the methyl groups on the double bond.\n\nLet's visualize the major (*endo*) product:\n```\n         // Endo Isomer (Major Product) //\n\n               CH2 (C7 bridge)\n              /   \\\n      (Me)C1-------C4(Me) (bridgehead)\n         |         |\n      (Me)C5=======C6(Me)  <-- Alkene Methyls are close to...\n           \\       /\n            \\     /\n           Hα-C-----C-Hα    <-- Anhydride Protons\n             |       |\n           O=C-------C=O\n               \\   /\n                 O\n```\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the NOESY NMR data.**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY)** shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This cross-peak must correspond to a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, the unique proximity in the *endo* (major) product is between the **anhydride protons (Hα)** and the **alkene methyl protons**.\n*   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak connects the signals for these two sets of protons.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the ¹H NMR signals and match with the options.**\n\nNow we need to predict the chemical shifts and multiplicities for the relevant protons in the product.\n\n1.  **Anhydride Protons (Hα):**\n    *   These are two equivalent protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n    *   They are equivalent by symmetry, so they should appear as a **singlet**.\n    *   Their integral will be **2H**.\n    *   Their chemical shift will be downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the anhydride. A typical range is **~3.5-4.0 ppm**.\n    *   So, we look for a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\n2.  **Alkene Methyl Protons:**\n    *   These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond.\n    *   They are equivalent by symmetry, so they should appear as a **singlet**.\n    *   Their integral will be **6H**.\n    *   The typical chemical shift for vinylic methyl groups is **~1.6-2.0 ppm**.\n    *   So, we look for a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n3.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:**\n    *   These are two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They will also be a **6H singlet** but at a higher field (more shielded), typically **~1.0-1.3 ppm**.\n\n4.  **Methylene Bridge Protons (C7-H):**\n    *   These two protons are non-equivalent and would likely form a complex multiplet or an AB quartet.\n\nThe cross-peak in the major product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons. We are looking for the option that describes these two signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1:** 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride protons)\n*   **Signal 2:** 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Alkene methyls)\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\nOption B perfectly matches our prediction for the two interacting groups of protons. The `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` corresponds to the alkene methyls, and the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` corresponds to the anhydride protons (Hα). This interaction is unique to the major *endo* isomer, as required by the problem description.\n\n<<<B>>>"
