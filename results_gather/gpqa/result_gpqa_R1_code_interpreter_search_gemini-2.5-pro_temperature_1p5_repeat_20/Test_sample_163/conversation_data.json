    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). The total mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its two stars (M = m1 + m2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where spectral lines from both stars are visible), the total mass of the system (M = m1 + m2) can be determined from the orbital period (P), the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2), and the inclination of the orbit (i). The formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    M = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Eclipses\" Information:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For eclipses to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90 degrees. At i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin^3(i) = 1. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume sin(i) ≈ 1 for both. This term will cancel out when we take the ratio of the masses.\n\n4.  **Set up the Mass Ratio:** We want to calculate the ratio M1 / M2.\n    *   For system_1: M1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i1))\n    *   For system_2: M2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i2))\n\n    The ratio is:\n    M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i1)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i2)) ]\n\n    The constants (2 * π * G) and the inclination terms (sin^3(i)) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    M1 / M2 = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3 ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3 ]\n\n5.  **Gather the Data:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s, 5 km/s\n        *   Sum of amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s, 10 km/s\n        *   Sum of amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Substitute the values into the simplified ratio formula. We can use python to perform the calculation accurately.\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0  # km/s\nK1b = 5.0   # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # years\nK2a = 15.0 # km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # km/s\n\n# The total velocity amplitude for system 1\nK_total_1 = K1a + K1b\n\n# The total velocity amplitude for system 2\nK_total_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# The ratio of the total masses M1/M2 is given by:\n# (P1 * (K_total_1)^3) / (P2 * (K_total_2)^3)\n# We do not need to convert units as they will cancel out in the ratio.\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K_total_1)**3) / (P2 * (K_total_2)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n0.432\n```\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculation shows that the ratio M1 / M2 is 0.432. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) ~ 1.2\n    B) ~ 0.6\n    C) ~ 0.7\n    D) ~ 0.4\n\nThe value 0.432 is approximately 0.4. Therefore, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The total mass M of a binary system is related to the orbital period P and the sum of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 + K2) by the mass function for a double-lined spectroscopic binary. The formula, derived from Kepler's third law, is:\n\nM = (m1 + m2) = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2πG * sin^3(i))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing, which means the inclination angle 'i' is very close to 90 degrees. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and thus sin^3(i) = 1. Since this term is approximately 1 for both systems, it will cancel out when we take the ratio of the masses. The constant term 2πG will also cancel.\n\nSo, the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_2) can be simplified to:\n\nM_1 / M_2 = [P_1 * (K_1a + K_1b)^3] / [P_2 * (K_2a + K_2b)^3]\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n\nFor system_1:\nP_1 = 2 years\nK_1a = 10 km/s\nK_1b = 5 km/s\nK_1a + K_1b = 15 km/s\n\nFor system_2:\nP_2 = 1 year\nK_2a = 15 km/s\nK_2b = 10 km/s\nK_2a + K_2b = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n\nM_1 / M_2 = [2 * (15)^3] / [1 * (25)^3]\nM_1 / M_2 = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)\nM_1 / M_2 = 6750 / 15625\nM_1 / M_2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
