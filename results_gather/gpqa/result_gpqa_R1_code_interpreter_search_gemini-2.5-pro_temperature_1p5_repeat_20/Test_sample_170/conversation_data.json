    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The question asks to order the substances by the *increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield*. This means we need to determine the directing effects of each substituent and how they influence the ratio of *ortho*, *meta*, and *para* products.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:** Substituents on a benzene ring are classified based on their effect on reactivity (activating/deactivating) and their directing effect (*ortho,para*-directing or *meta*-directing).\n\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene): `-CH3` is an alkyl group. It's **activating** and ***ortho,para*-directing**.\n        2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate): `-COOC2H5` is an ester group. It's **deactivating** and ***meta*-directing**.\n        3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): `-Cl` is a halogen. It's **deactivating** but ***ortho,para*-directing**.\n        4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene): `-NO2` is a nitro group. It's strongly **deactivating** and ***meta*-directing**.\n        5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): `-C2H5` is an alkyl group. It's **activating** and ***ortho,para*-directing**.\n        6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid): `-COOH` is a carboxylic acid group. It's **deactivating** and ***meta*-directing**.\n\n3.  **Group the Substances:** Based on their directing effects, we can form two main groups:\n    *   **Group 1 (*meta*-directors):** These will produce very little *para*-isomer. The main product will be *meta*. This group includes:\n        *   4 (`-NO2`)\n        *   6 (`-COOH`)\n        *   2 (`-COOC2H5`)\n    *   **Group 2 (*ortho,para*-directors):** These will produce significant amounts of the *para*-isomer (and *ortho*-isomer). This group includes:\n        *   1 (`-CH3`)\n        *   5 (`-C2H5`)\n        *   3 (`-Cl`)\n\n    The substances in Group 1 will have the lowest *para* yields and will come first in the ordered list. The substances in Group 2 will have the highest *para* yields and will come last.\n\n4.  **Order Substances within Group 1 (*meta*-directors):**\n    *   All three substituents (`-NO2`, `-COOH`, `-COOC2H5`) strongly direct the incoming electrophile to the *meta* position. The amount of *para* product formed is very small.\n    *   The yield of the minor *para* isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful *meta*-director, leaving an even smaller percentage for the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n        *   `-NO2` (4) is the strongest deactivator, so it will have the lowest *para* yield.\n        *   `-COOH` (6) is less deactivating than `-NO2`.\n        *   `-COOC2H5` (2) is the least deactivating among the three.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing *para*-isomer yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n5.  **Order Substances within Group 2 (*ortho,para*-directors):**\n    *   For *ortho,para*-directors, the distribution between *ortho* and *para* isomers is determined by a balance of electronic effects and steric hindrance. The *para* position is sterically less hindered.\n    *   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased steric bulk hinders the attack at the *ortho* position more effectively for ethylbenzene than for toluene. Consequently, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the *para*-isomer compared to toluene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Comparing alkyl groups (1, 5) with `-Cl` (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. Although they are deactivating overall (due to their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, -I), they are *ortho,para*-directing (due to electron-donating resonance effect, +R). The strong -I effect is felt most strongly at the *ortho* position, making it less reactive compared to the *para* position. This leads to a very high ratio of *para* to *ortho* product for halobenzenes. For bromination, chlorobenzene gives about 89% *para*-isomer, which is significantly higher than for toluene (~68% *para*).\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing *para*-isomer yield for this group is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n6.  **Combine the Groups to Form the Final Order:**\n    *   The first part of the sequence is the *meta*-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n    *   The second part is the *ortho,para*-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n    *   Combining these gives the final order of increasing *para*-isomer yield:\n        **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n7.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n    *   B) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n    *   C) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n    *   D) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\n    The calculated order matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
