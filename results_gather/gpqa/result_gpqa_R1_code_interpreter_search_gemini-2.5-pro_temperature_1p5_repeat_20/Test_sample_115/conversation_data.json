    "**1. Identifying Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum shows two signals:\n    *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H. A triplet (t) indicates adjacent to a -CH2- group (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks). 6H suggests two equivalent methyl (CH3) groups. So, we have two `CH3-CH2-` fragments.\n    *   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H. A quartet (q) indicates adjacent to a -CH3 group (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks). 4H suggests two equivalent methylene (CH2) groups. So, we have two `-CH2-CH3` fragments.\n*   Putting these pieces together, we have two equivalent ethyl groups (`CH3-CH2-`). The simplest stable alkane formed from these fragments is n-butane (`CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3`).\n*   In n-butane, the two CH3 groups are equivalent (6H), and they are adjacent to a CH2 group, so they would appear as a triplet. The two CH2 groups are equivalent (4H) and are adjacent to a CH3 on one side and a CH2 on the other. This would technically be a multiplet (sextet), but it is often simplified or appears as a broad quartet in low-resolution spectra. Given the context, n-butane is the most logical structure for Compound A.\n\n**2. Identifying Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation reaction. There are two possible products: 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane.\n    *   `CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3 + Br2 -> CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br` (1-bromobutane)\n    *   `CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3 + Br2 -> CH3-CH2-CH(Br)-CH3` (2-bromobutane)\n\n**3. Identifying Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is an E2 elimination reaction (dehydrohalogenation) to form an alkene.\n*   The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers (cis and trans).\n    *   Elimination of 1-bromobutane yields only but-1-ene, which has no geometrical isomers.\n    *   Elimination of 2-bromobutane yields but-2-ene (major product) and but-1-ene (minor product). But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n*   Therefore, Compound C is but-2-ene. The reaction uses the *cis*-isomer of Compound C.\n\n**4. The Diels-Alder Reaction to form Compound D**\n\n*   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a diene and a dienophile.\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\n    *   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene\n*   The reaction forms a six-membered ring. The product will be a **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This structural information eliminates options C and D, which have a 4,6,6-trimethyl substitution pattern.\n\n**5. Stereochemistry of Compound D**\n\n*   The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the reactants and the reaction mechanism (endo preference).\n\n    *   **Rule 1 (Dienophile):** The stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained. Since we start with *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (at positions 5 and 6 of the product) will be *cis* to each other.\n\n    *   **Rule 2 (Diene):** The stereochemistry of the diene's termini determines the relative orientation of their substituents in the product. For an (E,E)-diene, the two \"outside\" substituents end up *cis* to each other. In (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, the \"outside\" groups are the -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4. Therefore, the **-OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4 are *cis* to each other** in the product.\n\n    *   **Rule 3 (Endo Rule):** The reaction kinetically favors the *endo* transition state, where the substituents on the dienophile are oriented *cis* to the \"inside\" groups of the diene. The \"inside\" groups of our diene are the H atoms at C1 and C4. Therefore, the dienophile's methyl groups (at C5 and C6) will be *trans* to the diene's \"outside\" groups (-OH at C1 and -CH3 at C4).\n\n*   **Combining the rules to determine relative stereochemistry:**\n    1.  The -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4 are *cis*.\n    2.  The -CH3 at C5 and the -CH3 at C6 are *cis*.\n    3.  The first pair of groups (-OH, -CH3(C4)) is *trans* to the second pair of groups (-CH3(C5), -CH3(C6)).\n\n*   **Assigning R/S Configuration:**\n    Let's model one of the two possible enantiomers. Let the (-OH at C1) and (-CH3 at C4) be \"up\" (wedge). This means the (-CH3 at C5) and (-CH3 at C6) must be \"down\" (dash).\n    *   **C1:** Pri: OH(1), C2(2), C6(3), H(4). OH is up (Wedge), H is down (Dash). The sequence 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise. **C1 is S.**\n    *   **C4:** Pri: C3(1), C5(2), -CH3(3), H(4). -CH3 is up (Wedge), H is down (Dash). The sequence 1→2→3 is clockwise. **C4 is R.**\n    *   **C5:** Pri: C6(1), C4(2), -CH3(3), H(4). -CH3 is down (Dash), H is up (Wedge). The sequence 1→2→3 is clockwise. Since H is up, we reverse the result. Clockwise → R becomes **S**. **C5 is S.**\n    *   **C6:** Pri: C1(1), C5(2), -CH3(3), H(4). -CH3 is down (Dash), H is up (Wedge). The sequence 1→2→3 is clockwise. Since H is up, we reverse the result. Clockwise → R becomes **S**. **C6 is S.**\n\n*   The resulting configuration for this enantiomer is **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6S)**.\n\n*   Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol\n    B) (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol\n    C) (1S,4S)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol\n    D) (1S,4R)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol\n\nOur calculated configuration matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
