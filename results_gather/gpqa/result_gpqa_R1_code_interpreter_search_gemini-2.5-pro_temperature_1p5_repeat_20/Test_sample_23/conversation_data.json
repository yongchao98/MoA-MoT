    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`, using integer atomic masses.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`. This value is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`). Let's assume the intended value is 1/7.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` => `7y = 12x + y` => `6y = 12x` => `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as being widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only substance Z.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C is Z. So, C is a cycloalkane, CnH2n.\n    *   Since hydrogenation of D also produces Z (CnH2n), D must be an unsaturated hydrocarbon with the same carbon skeleton as Z. Because D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic hydrocarbon (an arene).\n    *   The simplest aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6). If n=6, Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12), and D would be benzene (C6H6). This fits the criteria: Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}. Neither decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane.\n    *   If n=7, Z would be methylcyclohexane (C7H14), and D would be toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8). This also fits the criteria.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must contain C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (the cycloalkane CnH2n). This means A and B are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is described as a disproportionation. Y is an equimolar mixture. This suggests the reaction stoichiometry is `A + B → C + D`. This type of reaction, involving hydrogen transfer between molecules, is common over platinum catalysts and is often broadly referred to as disproportionation in this context.\n\n4.  **Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n    *   The reaction is `A + B → C + D`. We have established that C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n) and D is an arene (likely CnH(2n-6) for a monocyclic system).\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms: `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = H_atoms(C) + H_atoms(D)`\n        `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   A and B are unsaturated versions of Z (CnH2n). They are likely a cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) and a cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)).\n    *   Let's check if this fits the hydrogen balance: `(2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of a cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)).\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific Compounds and Solve the Question**\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios depending on the value of n. The smallest possible value for n is 6, as benzene (C6H6) is the smallest neutral aromatic hydrocarbon.\n    *   **Case 1: n = 6**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n        *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H(2*6-2) = C6H10)\n        *   B = A non-conjugated cyclohexadiene, which is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H(2*6-4) = C6H8).\n        *   This scenario fits all the conditions of the problem.\n    *   **Case 2: n = 7**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)\n        *   Y = {Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), Toluene (C7H8)}\n        *   A = A methylcyclohexene (C7H12)\n        *   B = A non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10).\n        *   This scenario also fits all the conditions.\n\n6.  **Distinguishing Between the Cases**\n    *   We have two potential answers for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X:\n        *   Case 1 (n=6): H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n        *   Case 2 (n=7): H atoms = 12 (from C7H12) + 10 (from C7H10) = 22.\n    *   Both 18 and 22 are given as options (C and B). Chemistry problems of this type usually have a single correct answer. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and \"textbook\" example of this type of chemistry. In the absence of information that would invalidate it or point specifically to a higher homolog, the simplest case is the intended answer.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   Based on the most plausible C6 scenario:\n    *   Liquid 1 in X is cyclohexene, C6H10. It has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 in X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8. It has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>"
