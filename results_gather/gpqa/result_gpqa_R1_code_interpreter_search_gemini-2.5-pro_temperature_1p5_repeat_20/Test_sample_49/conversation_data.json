    "This is a problem that can be solved by understanding the general structure of calculations in quantum field theory, specifically how loop diagrams are evaluated.\n\n1.  **The Origin of Factors of 4π:** In quantum field theory, when calculating the value of a Feynman diagram, each closed loop introduces an integral over an undetermined four-momentum, let's call it `k`. In four-dimensional spacetime, this integral is of the form `∫ d⁴k / (2π)⁴`.\n\n2.  **Dimensional Regularization and Loop Factors:** A standard technique to handle the divergences that often appear in these integrals is dimensional regularization. In this method, the calculation is performed in `D` dimensions instead of 4. The key result from performing a loop integral in `D` dimensions is the appearance of a characteristic geometric factor. After performing the momentum-space integral, each loop consistently produces a factor proportional to:\n    `1 / (4π)^(D/2)`\n\n3.  **Specializing to Four Dimensions (D=4):** The problem specifies that the theory is on four-dimensional spacetime. So we set D=4 in the general formula:\n    Factor per loop = `1 / (4π)^(4/2) = 1 / (4π)²`\n\n4.  **Generalizing to L Loops:** If a Feynman diagram has `L` loops, it will involve `L` independent loop integrals. Each integral will contribute a factor of `1/(4π)²`. Therefore, the total factor from all `L` loops will be:\n    Total factor = `(1 / (4π)²)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Given Expression:** The expression provided is:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\n    We can see the term `1/(4pi)^6` in this expression. This is the crucial clue.\n\n6.  **Solving for the Number of Loops (L):** We can now equate the general formula for the loop factor with the one from the scribbled note:\n    `1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)^6`\n\n    By comparing the exponents in the denominator, we get:\n    `2L = 6`\n\n    Solving for `L` gives:\n    `L = 3`\n\nThe other parts of the expression relate to different aspects of the calculation: `alpha^3 * g^2` relates to the coupling constants and the number of vertices, `sqrt(2)` and `8` are numerical factors from symmetries or algebra, and `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of energy scales that depends on the kinematics of the process. However, the power of `(4π)` is a robust indicator of the number of loops.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
