    "Here is a breakdown of the thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, out of all possible cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify All Species:** In a solution of Co(II) and thiocyanate (SCN-), a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The cobalt-containing species are:\n    *   The free hydrated ion: `Co^2+`\n    *   The first complex: `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n    *   The second complex: `[Co(SCN)2]` (this is the one we are interested in)\n    *   The third complex: `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n    *   The fourth complex: `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n3.  **Use Stability Constants (β):** The problem provides overall stability constants (β), which describe the formation of each complex from the free metal ion and the ligand.\n    *   `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN^-]) = 9`\n    *   `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) = 40`\n    *   `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3) = 63`\n    *   `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4) = 16`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Total Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species.\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n5.  **Express Everything in Terms of a Common Variable:** To solve this, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co^2+]`, and the ligand concentration, `[SCN^-]`.\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n    Substituting these into the total concentration equation gives:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN^-] + β2*[SCN^-]^2 + β3*[SCN^-]^3 + β4*[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Define the Percentage (Alpha Fraction):** The percentage of a specific species (in this case, `[Co(SCN)2]`) is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all related species, multiplied by 100. This is known as the mole fraction or alpha fraction (α). We need to find `α2`.\n\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions from steps 4 and 5:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN^-] + β2*[SCN^-]^2 + β3*[SCN^-]^3 + β4*[SCN^-]^4))`\n\n    Notice that `[Co^2+]` cancels from the numerator and denominator, which simplifies the equation greatly:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN^-] + β2*[SCN^-]^2 + β3*[SCN^-]^3 + β4*[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n7.  **Apply Given Concentrations:**\n    *   The total cobalt concentration is `c(Co) = 10^-2 M`.\n    *   The thiocyanate concentration is `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`.\n    *   Since the ligand concentration (`0.1 M`) is significantly higher than the metal ion concentration (`0.01 M`), we can assume that the amount of `SCN-` consumed to form the complexes is small. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of free `[SCN-]` as its initial concentration, `0.1 M`. This is a standard and valid assumption in such problems.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Value:** Now, we just need to plug the numbers into the simplified formula for `α2`. Let `L = [SCN^-] = 0.1`.\n\n    *   **Numerator:** `β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator:** `1 + (β1*L) + (β2*L^2) + (β3*L^3) + (β4*L^4)`\n        `= 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n        `= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n        `= 2.3646`\n\n    *   **α2:** `0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n9.  **Convert to Percentage:** To get the percentage, multiply `α2` by 100.\n    `Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\n10. **Final Answer Selection:** This value is closest to option C. To confirm the calculation precisely, we can use a small script.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# The denominator of the alpha fraction formula is a polynomial in [SCN-]\n# Let's calculate the sum of the terms: 1 + Σ(β_i * [SCN-]^i)\ndenominator_sum = 1 + beta1 * SCN_conc**1 + beta2 * SCN_conc**2 + beta3 * SCN_conc**3 + beta4 * SCN_conc**4\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator_term = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\n\n# The alpha fraction (α2) is the ratio of the specific term to the total sum\nalpha2 = numerator_term / denominator_sum\n\n# The percentage is the alpha fraction multiplied by 100\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n\n> **Execution Output:**\n> ```\n> 16.916180326482276\n> ```\n\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the cobalt species present in the equilibrium. Starting from the free Co(II) ion, it can form complexes by successively adding thiocyanate (SCN-) ligands:\n*   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n*   `[Co(SCN)]+` (monothiocyanato)\n*   `[Co(SCN)2]` (dithiocyanato)\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]-` (trithiocyanato)\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-` (tetrathiocyanato)\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the free metal ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\nWe can substitute these expressions into the equation for the total cobalt concentration:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\nBy factoring out `[Co^2+]`, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)2]` is its mole fraction (α₂) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction is the concentration of the specific species divided by the total concentration of all related species.\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n`α₂ = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels from the numerator and the denominator, simplifying the equation to:\n`α₂ = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nWe are given that the concentration of `[SCN-]` is 0.1 M. Since this is in 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can assume that the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand `[SCN-]` is approximately equal to its initial concentration, 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is not needed to calculate the percentage.\n\nNow we plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1` M\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   1 = 1\n*   `β1 * [SCN-]` = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   `β2 * [SCN-]^2` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   `β3 * [SCN-]^3` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   `β4 * [SCN-]^4` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSum of terms in the denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to `[Co(SCN)2]`, which is `β2 * [SCN-]^2` = 0.4.\n\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches the value calculated by the code (16.916...). Therefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
