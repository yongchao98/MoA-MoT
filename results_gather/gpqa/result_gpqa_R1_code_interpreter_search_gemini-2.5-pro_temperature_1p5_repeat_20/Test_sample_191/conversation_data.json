    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This conductor has a cavity inside, which is also spherical but its center is displaced from the center of the conductor. A positive point charge, $+q$, is placed somewhere within this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of charge induction:**\n    *   The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity).\n    *   To determine the total charge on this inner surface, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   A key property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside its material is zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through our chosen Gaussian surface is zero, because $\\vec{E}=0$ everywhere on the surface. This implies that the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   The charge enclosed is the sum of the point charge $+q$ and the induced charge on the inner surface, $q_{inner}$. So, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   This means the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$. The distribution of this charge might be non-uniform, depending on the position of $+q$ inside the cavity, but the total amount is exactly $-q$.\n\n3.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (total charge = 0).\n    *   Due to induction, a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface.\n    *   To maintain overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. This is a consequence of the law of conservation of charge. So, $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the electric field outside the conductor (Electrostatic Shielding):**\n    *   The total electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges: the point charge $+q$, the charge on the inner surface $q_{inner} = -q$, and the charge on the outer surface $q_{outer} = +q$.\n    *   Let's consider the combined effect of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface. It is a fundamental result of electrostatics (a property of Faraday cages) that the electric field produced by a charge inside a conducting shell and the corresponding induced charge on the inner surface is zero everywhere outside the inner surface.\n    *   Therefore, for the point P which is outside the main conductor (and thus also outside the cavity), the net electric field from the charge $+q$ and the inner surface charge $-q$ is zero.\n    *   This means the electric field at point P is solely due to the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Determine the distribution of the outer charge:**\n    *   The charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   This charge resides on a spherical surface.\n    *   The charges inside the cavity are completely shielded from the outer surface. There are no other external charges in the vicinity.\n    *   Therefore, there are no external electric fields to influence the distribution of charge on the outer surface. To be in a state of stable equilibrium (minimum energy), the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface.\n\n6.  **Calculate the electric field at point P:**\n    *   The problem now simplifies to finding the electric field at a point P due to a uniformly charged spherical shell of radius $R$ and total charge $+q$.\n    *   A well-known result from Gauss's Law is that the electric field outside a uniformly charged sphere is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge is $+q$. The center is the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as $L$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The parameters $r$ (radius of the cavity), $s$ (distance between centers), $l$ (distance from cavity center to P), and $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding. They are provided as distractors. The external field only depends on the net charge that was introduced ($+q$, which gets transferred to the outer surface) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
