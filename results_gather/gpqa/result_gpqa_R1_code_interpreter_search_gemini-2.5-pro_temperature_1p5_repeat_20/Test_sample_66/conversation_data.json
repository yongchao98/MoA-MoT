    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\n\n*   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. The orbital angular momentum quantum number for a p-orbital is $l=1$. So, for the two electrons, we have $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n*   In this coupled state:\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). This means the system is in an eigenstate of the operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### 2. Understand the Measurement and the Final State\n\n*   A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed.\n*   The possible eigenvalues for $L_{1z}$ are $m_{l1}\\hbar$, and for $L_{2z}$ are $m_{l2}\\hbar$. Since $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$, the possible values for both $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ are -1, 0, and 1.\n*   The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n*   This corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled eigenstate where $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. This state is represented by the ket $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n### 3. Apply the Principles of Quantum Mechanics\n\nThere are two primary ways to solve this problem:\n\n#### Method 1: Conservation of the Z-Component of Angular Momentum\n\n1.  The initial state of the system is $|1, 1, 2, -1>$. This is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n2.  The final state we are asking about is $|-1, -1>$. Let's determine the total z-component of angular momentum for this state.\n    $L_z |-1, -1> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |-1, -1> = (m_{l1}\\hbar + m_{l2}\\hbar)|-1, -1> = (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar)|-1, -1> = -2\\hbar |-1, -1>$.\n    So, the state $|-1, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$.\n3.  The measurement process must conserve the total z-component of angular momentum. We are starting in a state where the total z-component is -1 (in units of $\\hbar$) and asking for the probability of ending in a state where the total z-component is -2.\n4.  Since the initial and final states have different total z-components of angular momentum ($-1\\hbar \\neq -2\\hbar$), this transition is forbidden. In quantum mechanics, states that are eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) with different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n5.  The probability of measuring the initial state to be in the final state is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n    $P = |<-1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n    Because the states are orthogonal, their inner product is zero: $<-1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n6.  Therefore, the probability is $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\n#### Method 2: Using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients\n\n1.  The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} <l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m> |m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$.\n2.  A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n3.  We are given the state $|l=2, m=-1>$.\n4.  We want to find the probability of measuring the outcome $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$. This probability is the square of the coefficient of the state $|-1, -1>$ in the expansion of $|2, -1>$.\n    $P(-1, -1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$.\n5.  Let's check the selection rule: $m = -1$, while $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n6.  Since $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$ must be zero.\n7.  Therefore, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nTo be explicit, the expansion for the state $|2, -1>$ is:\n$|2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |m_{l1}=0, m_{l2}=-1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=0>$\nAs you can see, the basis state $|-1, -1>$ is not part of this expansion, meaning the amplitude for finding the system in that state is zero.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion: the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
