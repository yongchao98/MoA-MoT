    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** The two compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Verify the Molecular Formula of the Options**\n\nFirst, let's confirm all the given compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4):** C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-) fit this formula.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2):** C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14. This also fits.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their splitting patterns (multiplicity), and their relative integrations.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 signals total (one 2H singlet, one 12H singlet).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They are not adjacent to other protons, giving one **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three non-equivalent sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in three separate **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, or 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 4 signals total (one 2H singlet, three aliphatic singlets with 6H, 3H, and 3H integrations).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, giving one **singlet** (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent, giving a second **singlet** (6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one 2H singlet, two 6H singlets).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are equivalent, giving one **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups produce:\n        1.  A **quartet** for the CH2 groups (split by the CH3).\n        2.  A **triplet** for the CH3 groups (split by the CH2).\n    *   The problem states all signals are singlets, so **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This also eliminates option B.\n\n**4. Analyze the Combined Spectrum of the Mixture**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations (A, C, D) to see which one matches the observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture.\n\n**Key Data Points for the Mixture:**\n*   Aromatic: Two singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n*   Aliphatic: Three singlets, 2:1:1 ratio. The total aliphatic protons from a 1:1 mixture are 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio means the signals must integrate to 12H, 6H, and 6H respectively.\n\n**Let's test Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** Provides a 2H aromatic singlet and a 12H aliphatic singlet.\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):** Provides a 2H aromatic singlet and two 6H aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **Combined Aromatic Spectrum:** We have one 2H singlet from the first compound and one 2H singlet from the second. Assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, this results in **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals arise from 2 protons, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n\n*   **Combined Aliphatic Spectrum:** We have one 12H singlet from the first compound and two separate 6H singlets from the second compound. Assuming these three signals are all resolved (have different chemical shifts), the mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the data perfectly.\n\nThis combination explains all features of the spectrum without needing to assume any unusual overlaps (accidental degeneracies).\n\n**Why other options are less likely:**\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** The aliphatic signals would be one 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) and three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This would result in four aliphatic signals unless two signals happened to have the exact same chemical shift (accidental degeneracy). To get the 2:1:1 ratio, the two 3H signals from Isodurene would need to be degenerate, which is possible but less straightforward than the explanation provided by option D.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** This combination would give two 6H singlets from the first compound and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from the second. This would result in up to five aliphatic signals. To achieve the observed spectrum, it would require multiple, unlikely accidental degeneracies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only pair that directly predicts an NMR spectrum with two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets.\n\n<<<D>>>"
