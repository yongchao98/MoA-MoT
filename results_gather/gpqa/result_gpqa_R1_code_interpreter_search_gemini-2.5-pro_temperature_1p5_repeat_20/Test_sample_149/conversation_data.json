    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C₈H₉NO. The DoU is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional degree of unsaturation (like a C=C or C=O bond).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂) (according to the n+1 rule, 2 neighboring protons give a 2+1=3 peak triplet).\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is typical for an amino group (-NH₂) due to proton exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen nucleus.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This is a doublet for 2 protons. The chemical shift suggests it's a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like the aldehyde) and an aromatic ring. The doublet splitting indicates it is coupled to a single proton, which is the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:**\n    *   From the NMR, we can piece together the fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH₂ group, and a -CH₂-CHO group.\n    *   Putting them together, we get 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (from the ring) + NH₂ + C₂H₃O (from -CH₂CHO) = C₈H₉NO. This matches the given formula.\n    *   So, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This set of reagents is used to convert a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    The amine group on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to a diazonium group.\n    *   Intermediate 1: **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Adding water to a diazonium salt (often with warming) causes hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Intermediate 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    We are now reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This aldehyde has two acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the carbonyl). Aldehydes with α-hydrogens undergo a base-catalyzed **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **a. Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻ from KOH) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion.\n        `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO + OH⁻ ⇌ [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻ + H₂O`\n\n    *   **b. Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **c. Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide intermediate is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product. The structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B, which is an intermediate, not the final product).\n        Structure: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-C₆H₄-OH`\n\n    *   **d. Dehydration:** The reaction mixture is heated. This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product (dehydration). The α-hydrogen (on C2) and the β-hydroxyl group (on C3) are removed, forming a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal → 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal + H₂O`\n\n    *   **Final Product Structure:** The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde with the following structure:\n        `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO`\n        The IUPAC name for this compound is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived final product with the given options:\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl).\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This perfectly matches the name of the final condensation product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
