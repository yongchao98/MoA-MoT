    "This question asks to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in many-body nuclear physics. The core idea of the impulse approximation is that an interaction with a nucleus can be treated as an interaction with a single, \"free\" nucleon, despite that nucleon being bound within the nucleus. Let's analyze each assumption:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is a foundational assumption. The impulse approximation simplifies a complex many-body interaction into a sum of single-body interactions. It posits that the probe (e.g., a lepton) interacts with just one nucleon at a time. It explicitly neglects processes where the probe interacts with a pair or cluster of nucleons simultaneously (these are known as two-body currents or meson-exchange currents). Therefore, this assumption is essential for treating the interaction as occurring on a quasi-free nucleon.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption deals with what are known as Initial State Interactions (ISI) and Final State Interactions (FSI). For the reaction to be cleanly described as an interaction with a single nucleon, the incoming probe must reach the target nucleon without being deflected by other nucleons (no ISI), and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) must exit the nucleus without further interactions (no FSI). In other words, the rest of the nucleus must be \"transparent\" to the particles involved in the primary reaction. This is a crucial part of the approximation, as FSIs would modify the energy and momentum of the outgoing nucleon, making it look different from a free nucleon reaction.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself (i.e., its composition from quarks and gluons as described by QCD). The impulse approximation, however, is a statement about the *nucleon's behavior within the nucleus*, not about the nucleon's internal dynamics. One can apply the impulse approximation regardless of whether the nucleon is treated as a simple point-like particle or a complex composite object with relativistic quarks. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation itself. It relates to the model of the nucleon's form factors, which is a separate consideration.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the essence of the \"impulse\" in the approximation's name. It assumes the interaction is so rapid (i.e., involves a large momentum transfer) that the timescale of the collision is much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus. During this brief \"impulse,\" the nucleon does not have time to interact with its neighbors or feel the influence of the overall nuclear potential (the binding force). It behaves, for that instant, as a free particle. The binding energy does affect the nucleon's initial state (it's off-shell and has a momentum distribution), but the interaction *dynamics* are treated as free. This assumption is fundamental.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are that the interaction targets a single nucleon (1), this nucleon behaves as if it's free from binding forces during the interaction (4), and there are no further complications from other nucleons before or after the main event (2). Assumption (3) is about the internal structure of the nucleon and is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation for the many-body system.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
