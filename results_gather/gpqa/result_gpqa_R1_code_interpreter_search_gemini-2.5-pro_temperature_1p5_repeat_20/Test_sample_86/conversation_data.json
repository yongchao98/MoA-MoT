    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents. The substitution can be *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). It has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. Let's list the possibilities for a 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl:\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This group has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. This is a very common substituent.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This group has 2 carbons and a carbonyl (aldehyde). This is also a possibility.\n        *   **Carboxy group (-COOH) is not possible** as it only has 1 carbon. An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) would have 3 carbons.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Possible Molecular Structures:**\n    Based on the above, the molecule must be a halo-substituted benzene ring with either an acetyl or a formylmethyl group.\n    *   **Structure I:** A halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   **Structure II:** A halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data in the Options:**\n    The key to distinguishing the correct structure and its isomerism (*ortho*, *meta*, *para*) is the 1H NMR spectrum. Let's focus on the aromatic region first.\n    *   Options **A** and **B** both show an aromatic region with two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This AA'BB' splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) substituted** benzene ring.\n    *   Options C and D lack the typical signals for aromatic protons (which are usually found > 6.5 ppm) and have unusual patterns, so they can be confidently eliminated.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Two Remaining Possibilities (Para-substituted isomers):**\n    We are now choosing between the 1H NMR spectra for `p-halo-acetophenone` and `p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde`.\n\n    *   **Possibility 1: Corresponds to Option B (p-halo-acetophenone)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and an acetyl group (-COCH3) are in a para-arrangement on the benzene ring.\n        *   **Expected Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic protons:** A para-substituted ring with an electron-withdrawing group like -COCH3 gives two doublets, typically between 7.4-8.0 ppm. This matches `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`.\n            *   **Acetyl protons (-COCH3):** A methyl group attached to a carbonyl gives a singlet (no adjacent protons) for 3H. The typical chemical shift is ~2.1-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Option B:** `1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`. This spectrum is a very good match for the p-halo-acetophenone structure.\n\n    *   **Possibility 2: Corresponds to Option A (p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and a formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO) are in a para-arrangement on the benzene ring.\n        *   **Expected Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic protons:** The -CH2CHO group is not directly conjugated with the ring. Its electron-withdrawing effect is weaker (inductive only) than a directly attached carbonyl. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be expected at a lower chemical shift (more upfield) compared to acetophenone.\n            *   **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is highly deshielded and gives a signal at ~9-10 ppm.\n            *   **Methylene protons (-CH2-):** These protons are benzylic and adjacent to an aldehyde, typically appearing around ~3.5-4.0 ppm.\n        *   **Option A:** `1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. While the aldehyde (9.9 ppm) and methylene (3.7 ppm) shifts are plausible, the aromatic shifts (7.8, 7.6 ppm) are too far downfield. A non-conjugated group like -CH2CHO would result in aromatic signals closer to 7.2-7.4 ppm. The strong deshielding to 7.6-7.8 ppm indicates a powerful, directly conjugated electron-withdrawing group like the ketone in acetophenone.\n\n6.  **Search for Reference Data (Confirmation):**\n    To confirm this reasoning, we can look up typical values.\n    *   The 1H NMR of `p-bromoacetophenone` shows signals at ~7.80 ppm (d, 2H), ~7.61 ppm (d, 2H), and ~2.59 ppm (s, 3H). This is an excellent match for the pattern and chemical shifts in Option B.\n    *   The 1H NMR of `p-chlorophenylacetaldehyde` shows signals at ~7.3 ppm (d, 2H), ~7.2 ppm (d, 2H), ~9.7 ppm (t, 1H), and ~3.6 ppm (d, 2H). The aromatic shifts here are significantly different from what is given in Option A.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data in Option B is highly consistent with the structure of a `p-halo-acetophenone`. The aromatic shifts, integration, and multiplicity strongly support a para-substituted ring with a conjugated carbonyl group. The signal at 2.3 ppm represents the methyl of the acetyl group.\n\n<<<B>>>"
