    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Phenotypes of Single Mutants\n\nFirst, let's understand the role of each gene individually by looking at the single knock-out mutants. The wild-type (WT) has 100% resistance.\n\n-   **g1 mutant (G1 knocked out):** 75% resistance. This means the loss of G1 function causes a 25% drop in resistance (100% - 75%). So, G1 contributes moderately to the resistance phenotype.\n-   **g2 mutant (G2 knocked out):** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway.\n-   **g3 mutant (G3 knocked out):** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function causes a 50% drop in resistance (100% - 50%). G3 contributes significantly to resistance, more than G1.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Phenotypes of Double Mutants to Determine Epistasis\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by a mutation in another gene. To determine if gene X is epistatic to gene Y, we compare the phenotype of the double mutant (xy) with the phenotype of the single mutant (x). If they are the same, X is epistatic to Y.\n\n-   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    -   Let's compare this to the single mutants: `g1` is 75%, and `g2` is 0%.\n    -   The phenotype of `g1g2` (0%) is identical to the phenotype of `g2` (0%).\n    -   Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. The `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation.\n\n-   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    -   Let's compare this to the single mutants: `g2` is 0%, and `g3` is 50%.\n    -   The phenotype of `g2g3` (0%) is identical to the phenotype of `g2` (0%).\n    -   Therefore, **G2 is also epistatic to G3**. The `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g3` mutation.\n\n-   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n    -   Let's compare this to the single mutants: `g1` is 75%, and `g3` is 50%.\n    -   The phenotype of `g1g3` (10%) is different from both `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%).\n    -   Therefore, **neither G1 is epistatic to G3, nor is G3 epistatic to G1**. The fact that the combined loss of function is much greater than the sum of individual losses (a 90% drop vs. a 25% + 50% = 75% drop) suggests a synergistic interaction, likely because they function in two parallel pathways contributing to resistance.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on the Epistasis Analysis\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options. The statements about epistasis are the most concrete conclusions we can draw from the data.\n\n-   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    -   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\": **This is CORRECT** based on our analysis.\n\n-   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    -   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": **This is FALSE**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n-   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    -   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": **This is FALSE**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n-   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    -   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": **This is FALSE**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n### 4. Synthesize a Pathway Model and Final Conclusion\n\nSince options B, C, and D contain demonstrably false statements about epistasis, they can be eliminated. Option A is the only one with a correct epistasis claim.\n\nLet's see if the other parts of Option A are plausible.\n-   **\"G2 is epistatic towards G1\"**: This suggests that G2 acts downstream of G1, or that G2 is an essential component required for G1's function. The fact that `g2` has a complete loss-of-function phenotype while `g1` is partial strongly supports a model where G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that both depend on the function of G2.\n    ```\n        Pathway 1 (provides 25% resistance) <-- G1\n                                                  |--> [Resistance]\n        Pathway 2 (provides 50% resistance) <-- G3\n                                                  |\n        Essential Component ------------------<-- G2\n    ```\n    This model fits all the data.\n-   **\"G1 is a transcription factor\"**: The problem states at least one gene is a TF acting upstream. In our proposed model, G1 acts upstream of the final resistance outcome and could certainly be a TF that activates \"Pathway 1\". This is a plausible statement.\n-   **\"G2 and G3 show pleiotropy\"**: Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. We only measured one trait (disease resistance), so we cannot confirm or deny this from the given data. However, in a multiple-choice question, an option with a correct key statement and some unverifiable (but not contradictory) information is far better than options with clearly false statements.\n\nGiven that the epistasis statement in A is correct and the epistasis statements in B, C, and D are false, option A is the only logical choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
