    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   Initial (stoichiometric) concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, $[CaY^{2-}]_{initial}$ = 0.02 M.\n    *   The formation constant for the Ca-EDTA complex, $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    *   The temperature is 25 °C and the pH is assumed to be ideal, which means we can use the given formation constant without worrying about protonation of the EDTA ligand (i.e., we can use $Y^{4-}$ as the form of the free ligand).\n\n2.  **Write the relevant chemical equation:** The Ca-EDTA complex is formed from the reaction of calcium ions with the EDTA ligand ($Y^{4-}$). The equilibrium is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY^{2-}]$\n\n3.  **Write the equilibrium constant expression:** The formation constant ($K_f$) is defined by the concentrations at equilibrium:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY^{2-}]]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We start with the complex, which will dissociate to a small extent to reach equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction ($[CaY^{2-}] \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$), the concentration of $Y^{4-}$ formed will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[CaY^{2-}]$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $Y^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n5.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression:**\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Apply a simplifying assumption:** The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can assume that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n7.  **Solve the simplified equation for x:**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, solve for x, which represents $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\nTo make the calculation easier, let's write it as:\n$x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times \\sqrt{10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nWe know that $\\sqrt{36} = 6$ and $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, so $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.3.\n$x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n8.  **Final Check:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value is much smaller than 0.02 M, confirming our initial assumption was valid. Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option A.\n\nWe can use a python script to get a more precise value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve the equation: K_f = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n# This is a quadratic equation: K_f * x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\na = K_f\nb = 1\nc = -initial_complex_conc\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Solve for x (concentration must be positive)\nx = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation gives $x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, which confirms the manual calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution that was prepared by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex will partially dissociate to reach equilibrium.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equation:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium reaction:\n    $[CaY^{2-}] \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n    where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand.\n\n2.  **Formation Constant ($K_f$):** The equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex is given:\n    $K_{f} = K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    The expression for the formation constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY^{2-}]]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):** We can set up an ICE table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ formed from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species       | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[CaY^{2-}]$  | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$     | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$      | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Calculation:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplifying Assumption:** Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means the complex will dissociate very little, and 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Solve for x:** The equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Take the square root to find x, which represents $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n    Since $\\sqrt{36} = 6$ and $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.3.\n    $x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. The code execution output confirms this calculation with a value of $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
