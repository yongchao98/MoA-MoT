    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-, in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\n    The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   KH2PO4 provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-), which acts as an acid in this context.\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), which acts as a base.\n    The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of the acid and conjugate base.**\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles of H2PO4-\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles of HPO4^2-\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations.**\n    *   [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Determine the governing equilibria.**\n    The solution is a buffer composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- / HPO4^2-. The pH of this solution is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n    H2PO4-  <=>  H+ + HPO4^2-       (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n\n    The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third dissociation, which involves the species HPO4^2-:\n    HPO4^2-  <=>  H+ + PO4^3-       (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\n5.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].**\n    We can use the equilibrium expression for Ka2 to find the [H+] in the buffer solution. We assume the initial concentrations are a good approximation of the equilibrium concentrations because the dissociation is weak.\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    Rearranging for [H+]:\n    [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n\n6.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\n    Using the equilibrium expression for Ka3, we can find [PO4^3-].\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    Rearranging for [PO4^3-]:\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\n    We can substitute the expression for [H+] from step 5 into this equation. We use the buffer-determined [H+] and the initial [HPO4^2-] because the third dissociation (governed by the very small Ka3) will not significantly alter their values.\n\n    This two-step calculation can be done efficiently with a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Calculate moles and initial concentrations\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# We assume initial concentrations are equal to equilibrium concentrations for the buffer calculation.\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# We use the [H+] from the buffer and the initial [HPO4^2-] because Ka3 is very small.\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to match the options\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>6.24e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is 6.24 x 10^-7 M.

    "This problem requires calculating the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-, in a solution containing H2PO4- and HPO4^2-. This is a buffer solution, and the concentration of PO4^3- will be determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of the buffer components:**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), which provides the acid component H2PO4-.\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = Mass of KH2PO4 / Molar mass of KH2PO4\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles.\n    *   The solution also contains disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O), which provides the conjugate base component HPO4^2-.\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O / Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**:\n    *   The solution is a buffer governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid:\n        H2PO4⁻  ⇌  H⁺ + HPO4²⁻      (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸)\n    *   We can use the equilibrium expression to find [H+]. We assume the initial concentrations are a good approximation of the equilibrium concentrations because the dissociation constant is small.\n        Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4³⁻]**:\n    *   The concentration of the orthophosphate ion is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium:\n        HPO4²⁻  ⇌  H⁺ + PO4³⁻      (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²)\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka3:\n        Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\n        [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Now, we substitute the values we calculated: the concentration of HPO4²⁻ from step 2 and the concentration of H⁺ from step 3.\n        [PO4³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n        [PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option B.\n\nThe provided Python script confirms this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Calculate moles and initial concentrations\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\n# The code output was 6.24e-07\n```\n\nFinal Answer: The concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution is 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\n<<<B>>>"
