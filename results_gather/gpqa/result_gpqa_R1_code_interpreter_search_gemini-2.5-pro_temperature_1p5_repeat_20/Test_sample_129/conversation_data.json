    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum redshift for a celestial object so that its Lyman-alpha absorption line can be detected by ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n1.  **Identify the rest wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha ($\\text{Ly}\\alpha$) line of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Consider the limitations of ground-based telescopes:** The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most ultraviolet radiation, primarily due to absorption by the ozone layer. Ground-based optical telescopes can only observe light within the \"atmospheric window.\" The short-wavelength (blue/UV) cutoff for this window is typically around 3200 to 3600 Å. Below this wavelength range, atmospheric absorption becomes prohibitively high for effective observation. Let's use a conservative but common value of 3500 Å as the minimum observable wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs, min}}$).\n\n3.  **Use the redshift formula:** The cosmological redshift ($z$) relates the rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) of an emission or absorption feature to its observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) through the following formula:\n    $$ \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1 + z) $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the minimum redshift:** For the Lyman-alpha line to be detectable, its observed wavelength must be shifted into the observable range. This means $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$ must be greater than or equal to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, min}}$.\n\n    $$ \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} \\ge \\lambda_{\\text{obs, min}} $$\n    $$ \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1 + z) \\ge \\lambda_{\\text{obs, min}} $$\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the minimum redshift ($z_{\\text{min}}$):\n    $$ 1 + z \\ge \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs, min}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} $$\n    $$ z \\ge \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs, min}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} - 1 $$\n\n    Now, we plug in the values:\n    *   $\\lambda_{\\text{rest}} = 1216 \\text{ Å}$\n    *   $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, min}} \\approx 3500 \\text{ Å}$\n\n    ```python\n    # Given values\n    lambda_rest = 1216  # Rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha in Angstroms\n    # Atmospheric cutoff for ground-based optical telescopes is around 3500 Angstroms.\n    lambda_obs_min = 3500  # Minimum observable wavelength in Angstroms\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum redshift z\n    # z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1\n    z_min = (lambda_obs_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n    \n    print(z_min)\n    ```\n\n    The calculation yields a minimum redshift of approximately 1.88.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) 3\n    B) 1.2\n    C) 1.9\n    D) 2.4\n\n    The calculated value of ~1.88 is closest to 1.9. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detectable with ground-based optical telescopes is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
