    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe fundamental principle we'll use is the conservation of energy. In a closed system with a conservative force, the total mechanical energy is constant. For a relativistic particle, the total mechanical energy is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy ($K$) and its potential energy ($U$).\n\n$E_{total} = K + U = \\text{constant}$\n\n**2. Define Kinetic and Potential Energy**\n\n*   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** The kinetic energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is given by:\n    $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy stored in the oscillator at a displacement $x$ from the equilibrium position is:\n    $U(x) = \\int_0^x -F(x') dx' = \\int_0^x kx' dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\nSo, the conserved total mechanical energy of the system is:\n$E_{total} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy at Extreme Points**\n\nWe can evaluate the total energy at two key points in the oscillator's motion and set them equal.\n\n*   **Point 1: Maximum Displacement (Turning Point)**\n    At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass momentarily comes to a stop before changing direction.\n    *   Displacement: $x = A$\n    *   Speed: $v = 0$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n    *   Kinetic Energy: $K = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$\n    *   Potential Energy: $U = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n*   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position (Center of Oscillation)**\n    At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero, and the mass reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$.\n    *   Displacement: $x = 0$\n    *   Speed: $v = v_{max}$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Kinetic Energy: $K = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n    *   Potential Energy: $U = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n**4. Solve for the Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$)**\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, we can equate the energy at Point 1 and Point 2:\n$(\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nNext, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nTo solve for $v_{max}$, we can perform the following algebraic steps:\n1.  Square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n2.  Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n3.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n4.  Finally, take the square root of both sides and multiply by $c$ to get $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\nThis expression matches option D.\n\n**Check the Classical Limit:**\nIn the classical limit, the speeds are much less than $c$, which corresponds to the potential energy being much smaller than the rest mass energy ($kA^2 \\ll mc^2$). Let $\\epsilon = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\ll 1$. Using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$ for small $x$:\n$\\frac{1}{(1+\\epsilon)^2} = (1+\\epsilon)^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2\\epsilon$\n$v_{max}^2/c^2 \\approx 1 - (1 - 2\\epsilon) = 2\\epsilon$\n$v_{max}^2 \\approx 2\\epsilon c^2 = 2 \\left(\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right) c^2 = \\frac{kA^2}{m}$\n$v_{max} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$\nThis is the correct classical result, which gives confidence in our relativistic derivation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
