    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions**\n    *   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** This is the mean free path of the *residual gas molecules colliding with each other*. In this scenario, all particles (the colliding particle and the target particle) are of the same type (gas molecules) and are in thermal motion.\n    *   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** This is the mean free path of the *beam electrons colliding (scattering) with the residual gas molecules*. In this scenario, the colliding particles (electrons) are very different from the target particles (gas molecules).\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area that a particle presents for a collision.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   For gas molecules colliding with each other, all particles are moving. The kinetic theory of gases accounts for the relative motion of the particles. This introduces a factor of the square root of 2 into the standard formula.\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule in a gas of identical molecules is:\n        **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules, and `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for two gas molecules. The `√2` (approximately 1.414) factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   The electrons are accelerated by a 1000 kV potential. This gives them extremely high kinetic energy, and their velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light, far exceeding the thermal velocities of the gas molecules.\n    *   From the perspective of the ultra-fast electron, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets.\n    *   When the colliding particle is much faster than the target particles, the `√2` factor is not used.\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a fast electron moving through a gas is:\n        **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron and a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2**\n    Let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n    **λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n6.  **Analyze the Cross-Sections (σ)**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size (van der Waals diameter, `d`) of the molecules. It is typically modeled as σ_gg ≈ πd².\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This is the scattering cross-section. It's more complex as it involves the electromagnetic interaction between the electron and the molecule's electron cloud and nucleus. However, for a high-energy electron, the interaction is only significant for very close passes. A simple hard-sphere model would treat the electron as a point particle and the gas molecule as a sphere of radius r = d/2. In this case, the cross-section would be σ_eg ≈ πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4 = σ_gg/4. Other models for high-energy scattering also suggest that σ_eg can be smaller than σ_gg.\n    *   However, for a first-order approximation, it is common to assume the cross-sections are of the same order of magnitude (σ_gg ≈ σ_eg).\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio and Conclude**\n    *   **Case 1: Assume similar cross-sections (σ_gg ≈ σ_eg)**. This is the most straightforward comparison based on the kinetic theory models.\n        λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2\n        λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1\n    *   **Case 2: Use the hard-sphere model (σ_eg ≈ σ_gg/4)**.\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / (σ_gg/4)) = 4√2\n        λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1\n\n    In either case, and in any physically realistic scenario, the removal of the `√2` from the denominator due to the high electron speed is the dominant factor. This means **λ2 is significantly greater than λ1**.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    Our primary estimate is `λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1`.\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect, as our estimate of 1.414 is not less than 1.22.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1...: Incorrect. The physics is different.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **Correct**. Our calculated value of `λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1` satisfies this condition. The number `1.22` is simply a value that is less than the theoretical lower bound of `√2`, making this the only valid choice.\n\nThe key insight is that electrons, being much faster than gas molecules, effectively \"see\" a field of stationary targets, allowing them to travel a longer average distance between collisions compared to a gas molecule moving amongst other moving gas molecules.\n\n<<<D>>>"
