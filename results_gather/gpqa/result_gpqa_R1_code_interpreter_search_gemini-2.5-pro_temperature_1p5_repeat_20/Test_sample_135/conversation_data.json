    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    The problem describes a vector field `f(r)` that points radially outward from the origin and has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2`. In spherical coordinates, this vector field can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **State the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇ · f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n    The integral is: `I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ · f) dV`\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface that encloses the volume. The theorem states:\n    `∫∫∫_V (∇ · f) dV = ∮∮_S (f · dS)`\n    Here, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n    *Note on a potential pitfall:* One might be tempted to first calculate the divergence `∇ · f`. In spherical coordinates, `∇ · f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`. Since `f_r = 1/r^2`, we get `∇ · f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`. If we integrate 0 over the volume, we get 0. However, this calculation is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. The vector field `f(r)` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and its divergence is also undefined there. The Divergence Theorem correctly handles this singularity at the origin.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    We will now calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, which is the flux of the field `f` through the surface of the sphere `S`.\n\n    *   **The field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius is constant, `r = R`. So the vector field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **The differential surface area vector:** For a sphere, the outward-pointing normal vector is always in the radial direction, so `n_hat = r_hat`. The differential surface area vector `dS` is given by `dS = n_hat * dS`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element. In spherical coordinates, `dS = R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`. Therefore, `dS = r_hat * (R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi))`.\n    *   **The dot product:** We need to compute `f · dS`:\n        `f · dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] · [ r_hat * (R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)) ]`\n        Since `r_hat · r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n        `f · dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`\n        `f · dS = sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`\n        Notice that the `R^2` terms cancel out, meaning the result will be independent of the radius of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Integral:**\n    Now we integrate `f · dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The integration limits are `phi` from `0` to `2π` and `theta` from `0` to `π`.\n    `∮∮_S (f · dS) = ∫_(phi=0)^(2π) ∫_(theta=0)^π sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= ( ∫_0^(2π) d(phi) ) * ( ∫_0^π sin(theta) d(theta) )`\n\n    *   Evaluate the `phi` integral:\n        `∫_0^(2π) d(phi) = [phi]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    *   Evaluate the `theta` integral:\n        `∫_0^π sin(theta) d(theta) = [-cos(theta)]_0^π = (-cos(π)) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    `∮∮_S (f · dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the original volume integral is equal to this surface integral.\n    `∫∫∫_V (∇ · f) dV = 4π`\n\n    The result is `4π`. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 4 π\n    B) 4/3 π R\n    C) 0\n    D) 1\n\n    The correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
