    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical system:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential energy of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means that the restoring force is the same in all directions, so the angular frequency $\\omega$ is constant for oscillations along the x, y, and z axes.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Hamiltonian and Schrödinger Equation:** The Hamiltonian for this system is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. In Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, the potential is $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The time-independent Schrödinger equation is $H\\psi = E\\psi$.\n\n3.  **Separate the variables:** The Hamiltonian can be separated into three independent parts, one for each Cartesian coordinate:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 i^2$ for $i=x, y, z$.\n    This means the total energy E is the sum of the energies from three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators: $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$.\n\n4.  **Recall the energy levels of a 1D harmonic oscillator:** The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator along a single axis (say, the x-axis) are given by:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n5.  **Determine the energy levels of the 3D harmonic oscillator:** By summing the energies for the three independent dimensions, we get the total energy for the 3D system:\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    Here, $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. Let's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels can then be expressed more compactly as:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n6.  **Identify the excited states and their energies:**\n    *   **Ground State:** $N = 0$. $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $N = 1$. $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N = 2$. $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N = 3$. The energy of this state is:\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the degeneracy of the third excited state:** The degeneracy is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same energy level. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $N = 3$.\n\n    We can list the combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    *   One number is 3, the others are 0: (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   One number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   All three numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1). This gives 1 state.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Alternatively, we can use the general formula for the degeneracy of the $N$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$.\n    For the third excited state ($N=3$):\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy. This matches option B. The energy expressions in options C and D correspond to a particle in a spherical box, which is a different physical system.\n\n<<<B>>>"
