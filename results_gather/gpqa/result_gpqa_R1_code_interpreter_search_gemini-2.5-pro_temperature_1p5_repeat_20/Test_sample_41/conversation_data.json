    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital distance).\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n    When we take the ratio of equilibrium temperatures for two planets orbiting the same star (so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and having the same albedo `A`, the formula simplifies significantly.\n\n    `T_eq_i / T_eq_j = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_i))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_j))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)]`\n    `T_eq_i / T_eq_j = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)`\n\n2.  **Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the orbital distances.**\n    We are given:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n    *   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n\n    Using the formula from Step 1:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = 1.4` => `a2 / a1 = 1.4^2 = 1.96`\n    *   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = (a3 / a2)^(1/2) = 2.3` => `a3 / a2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29`\n\n    To find the relationship between Planet 3 and Planet 1, we can multiply these ratios:\n    `a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96`\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3`\n    Therefore, the ratio of the periods is:\n    `(P3 / P1)^2 = (a3 / a1)^3`\n    `P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)`\n\n4.  **Note on extraneous information.**\n    The problem provides the ratios of the planets' masses and mentions the TTV discovery method and the albedo value.\n    *   **Masses and TTV:** The masses of the planets are generally negligible compared to the mass of the host star. Therefore, we can use the simplified version of Kepler's Third Law, and the mass information is not needed for this calculation. It provides context but is not part of the calculation itself.\n    *   **Albedo:** Since the albedo is the same for all three planets, it cancels out when we calculate the ratio of the temperatures. If the albedos were different, we would need to include them in the calculation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final result.**\n    Now we substitute the value of `a3 / a1` into the equation from Step 3. I will use a python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given temperature ratios\nT_eq1_over_T_eq2 = 1.4\nT_eq2_over_T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n# From the equilibrium temperature formula, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).\n# Therefore, T_eq_i / T_eq_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i).\n\n# Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes\n# a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2\na2_over_a1 = T_eq1_over_T_eq2**2\n\n# a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2\na3_over_a2 = T_eq2_over_T_eq3**2\n\n# Calculate the overall ratio of semi-major axes between Planet3 and Planet1\na3_over_a1 = a3_over_a2 * a2_over_a1\n\n# Apply Kepler's Third Law: (P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3, so P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)\nP3_over_P1 = a3_over_a1**(1.5)\n\nprint(f\"{P3_over_P1:.1f}\")\n```\n>>>\n33.4\n\n<<<A>>>",
