    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_2$), which is $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $R$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $T$ is the star's effective surface temperature.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can write the luminosities for Star_1 and Star_2:\n    $L_1 = 4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    The ratio $L_1 / L_2$ is therefore:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information about Radii:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2.\n    $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2 \\implies \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n\n    Substituting this into our ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** To find the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$), we need to use the information about the peak emission wavelengths.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars.\n    *   The peak wavelength emitted by a star in its own rest frame ($\\lambda_{max}$) is related to its temperature by Wien's Displacement Law: $T = b / \\lambda_{max}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n    *   The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) due to the Doppler effect. The relationship is: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{max} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Apply the Doppler Effect:**\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s. Therefore, its observed peak wavelength is equal to its rest-frame peak wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. Its observed peak wavelength is shifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{max,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   This gives us the relationship between the rest-frame peak wavelengths:\n        $\\lambda_{max,1} = \\lambda_{max,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Connect Wavelengths to Temperatures:**\n    *   From Wien's Law, $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{max,1}$ and $T_2 = b / \\lambda_{max,2}$.\n    *   The ratio of the temperatures is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b / \\lambda_{max,1}}{b / \\lambda_{max,2}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{max,2}}{\\lambda_{max,1}}$.\n    *   From the Doppler effect step, we know $\\frac{\\lambda_{max,2}}{\\lambda_{max,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Now substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_{r2}/c)^4}$\n\n    We now compute the numerical value:\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n    *   $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s\n    *   $\\frac{v_{r2}}{c} = \\frac{700}{299792.458} \\approx 0.0023349$\n\n    Plugging this value into the equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 0.0023349)^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1.0023349)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.009378} \\approx 2.2291$\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 2.23. This matches option B. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
