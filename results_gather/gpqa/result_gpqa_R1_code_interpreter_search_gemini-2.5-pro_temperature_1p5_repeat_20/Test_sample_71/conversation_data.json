    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (let's call it **N-OtBu**) and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium Iodide (NaI).\n\nThe first step is to identify the reactive species generated from 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with NaI. This reagent is complex, and its name could be a source of confusion. However, a very common and analogous reaction is the generation of *o*-xylylene (also known as *o*-quinodimethane, **OQ**) from 1,2-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene using NaI. *o*-Xylylene is a highly reactive diene used in Diels-Alder reactions. Given the context of the reaction (a diene source reacting with a dienophile), it is highly probable that the intended reaction generates *o*-xylylene or a similar reactive diene. Let's assume the reagent provided, despite its complex name, serves as a precursor to *o*-xylylene (**OQ**).\n\n**OQ** then acts as a diene in a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition with the dienophile **N-OtBu**. **N-OtBu** has two double bonds, and the reaction uses 2 equivalents of the **OQ** precursor, so two successive Diels-Alder reactions will occur.\n\n*   **Reaction:** **N-OtBu** + 2 **OQ** → Product **1**\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction typically proceeds on the less sterically hindered *exo* face of the norbornadiene system. In the reaction, the diene (**OQ**) adds across a double bond of the dienophile (**N-OtBu**). This reaction converts the double bond to single bonds and forms a new fused ring system. Specifically, an *o*-xylylene adduct results in a -CH₂-(*o*-C₆H₄)-CH₂- group fused to the norbornane skeleton. After two such additions, one across the C2=C3 bond and another across the C5=C6 bond, we obtain Product **1**.\n\nProduct **1** is a symmetrical molecule with a central bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core, a *tert*-butoxy group at C7, and two identical polycyclic adducts fused at the C2,C3 and C5,C6 positions.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n\nAqueous acid readily cleaves *tert*-butyl ethers. The *tert*-butoxy group (-O*t*Bu) at C7 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard deprotection step.\n\n*   Product **1** (-O*t*Bu) → Product **2** (-OH)\n\nThe overall polycyclic skeleton of the molecule remains unchanged.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **2** is treated with SO₃·pyridine in DMSO.\n\nThis set of reagents corresponds to the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing alcohols. Product **2** has a secondary alcohol at the C7 position. This alcohol is oxidized to a ketone.\n\n*   Product **2** (C7-OH) → Product **3** (C7=O)\n\nProduct **3** is the ketone corresponding to alcohol **2**. The symmetrical polycyclic structure is maintained.\n\n### Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **3** is heated at 150 °C.\n\nThis is the crucial step. Heating complex molecules often induces pericyclic reactions. Product **3** is a thermal protection/adduct of 7-ketonorbornadiene. The Diels-Alder reaction is reversible, and heating can trigger a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. The large adducts attached to the norbornane core can be removed upon heating. Let's consider the sequence of events:\n\n1.  **Partial retro-Diels-Alder:** The heating causes one of the two adducts to be eliminated, regenerating one double bond in the norbornane core. This is an equilibrium process.\n    *   **3** (bis-adduct ketone) ⇌ **M'** (mono-adduct ketone) + **OQ**\n    *   **M'** is a 7-norbornenone derivative. Specifically, it is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-7-one core with one remaining *o*-xylylene adduct fused at the C2,C3 position.\n\n2.  **Irreversible Cheletropic Elimination:** 7-Norbornenone derivatives are known to be thermally unstable. They readily undergo a cheletropic elimination (a type of pericyclic reaction) to extrude carbon monoxide (CO), which is an irreversible process driven by the formation of the stable CO gas.\n    *   **M'** (a 7-norbornenone derivative) → **4** (a cyclohexadiene derivative) + CO\n\nThe extrusion of CO from a substituted 7-norbornenone results in a substituted cyclohexa-1,3-diene. We need to trace the atoms to determine the structure of the final product **4**. The original C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 atoms of the norbornenone core form the new six-membered ring of cyclohexadiene. The adduct was at positions C2 and C3 of the norbornenone. These positions correspond to carbons C6 and C5 of the resulting cyclohexa-1,3-diene, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the final product **4** is a **cyclohexa-1,3-diene** molecule where the **C5 and C6 atoms are bridged by the -CH₂-(*o*-C₆H₄)-CH₂- group** that was the remaining adduct.\n\n### Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of product **4** to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure of 4:** A cyclohexa-1,3-diene ring. A -CH₂-(*o*-phenylene)-CH₂- group bridges the C5 and C6 positions.\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (Cₛ). The plane passes through the center of the phenylene ring and bisects the C5-C6 bond, the C1=C2 bond, and the C3=C4 bond.\n\nNow, let's count the sets of equivalent protons:\n\n1.  **Vinylic Protons:**\n    *   The protons on the double bonds are H1, H2, H3, and H4.\n    *   The symmetry plane makes H1 equivalent to H4.\n    *   The symmetry plane makes H2 equivalent to H3.\n    *   H1/H4 are in a different chemical environment than H2/H3.\n    *   This gives **2 distinct sets** of vinylic protons.\n\n2.  **Aliphatic Methine Protons:**\n    *   These are the protons at the bridgehead carbons C5 and C6 of the diene ring.\n    *   The symmetry plane makes H5 equivalent to H6.\n    *   This gives **1 distinct set** of methine protons.\n\n3.  **Methylene Bridge Protons:**\n    *   The bridge is -CH₂-Ar-CH₂-. The two CH₂ groups are equivalent due to the symmetry plane.\n    *   Within one CH₂ group, the two protons are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule and there's no local plane bisecting the H-C-H angle. They are in different chemical environments (one pointing \"in\", one \"out\").\n    *   This gives **2 distinct sets** of methylene protons.\n\n4.  **Aromatic Protons:**\n    *   The phenylene ring (-C₆H₄-) has 4 protons.\n    *   The symmetry plane bisects this ring, making protons on one side equivalent to those on the other.\n    *   There are two types of protons on one half of the ring (e.g., *ortho* and *meta* to one of the CH₂ attachments).\n    *   This gives **2 distinct sets** of aromatic protons.\n\n**Total number of distinct hydrogen atoms:**\n2 (vinylic) + 1 (methine) + 2 (methylene) + 2 (aromatic) = **7**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
