    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information into Molecular Fragments:**\n\n*   **Structure Core:** The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore **C6H4**. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two signals for aromatic hydrogens, which is characteristic of a symmetrically substituted ring, most likely a para (1,4) substitution.\n\n*   **Functional Group (FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an **ester group (-COO-)**. This group contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (**C1O2**).\n\n*   **Alkenyl Group (¹H NMR):** The NMR spectrum shows two signals for vinyl hydrogens (protons on a C=C double bond). The splitting pattern is described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\".\n    *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** indicates a proton that is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and also to three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This is a classic pattern for a proton in a `-CH=CH-CH3` group, specifically the one attached to the same carbon as the methyl group (`-CH-CH3`).\n    *   A **doublet (d)** would then correspond to the other vinyl proton (`-CH=`), which is only coupled to the first vinyl proton.\n    *   This evidence strongly points to the presence of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for three carbons and five hydrogens (**C3H5**).\n\n*   **Alkyl Groups (¹H NMR):** The NMR spectrum shows two signals for -CH3 groups.\n    *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**) we just identified.\n    *   Therefore, there must be a second, distinct **methyl group (-CH3)** elsewhere in the molecule. This fragment contributes one carbon and three hydrogens (**C1H3**).\n\n*   **Absence of Other Groups (¹H NMR):** The problem explicitly states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**. This is a critical piece of information that rules out structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other similar alkyl chains.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to determine the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   From the aromatic ring (C6H4): 6 C\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 1 C\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 C\n    *   From the second methyl group (-CH3): 1 C\n    *   **Total Carbon = 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 11 C**\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   From the aromatic ring (C6H4): 4 H\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5 H\n    *   From the second methyl group (-CH3): 3 H\n    *   **Total Hydrogen = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 H**\n\n*   **Oxygen (O) atoms:**\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2 O\n    *   **Total Oxygen = 2 O**\n\nPutting it all together, the molecular formula of the compound is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verify the Conclusion:**\n\n*   The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches one of the given options.\n*   We can also check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2 to ensure it is consistent with our proposed structure.\n    *   DoU formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n    *   DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n*   The required structural features are a benzene ring (DoU = 4), a C=C double bond (DoU = 1), and a C=O double bond (DoU = 1). The total required DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The calculated DoU for the formula C11H12O2 matches the structural requirements perfectly.\n*   The other chemical formulas provided are inconsistent with the spectroscopic data. For example, C11H14O2 (DoU=5) would lack the vinyl C=C bond, and C12H14O2 (DoU=6) would require adding a CH2 group, which is explicitly absent.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
