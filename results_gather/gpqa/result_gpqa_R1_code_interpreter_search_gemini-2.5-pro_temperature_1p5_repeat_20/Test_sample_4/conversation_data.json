    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Operators and the Direction Vector\n\nThe problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThese are the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle (like a muon).\n\nThe operator is to be calculated along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A general unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis. In Cartesian coordinates, this vector is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n### 2. Construct the Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$\n\nThe operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_n$, is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = P_x (\\sin\\theta) + P_y (0) + P_z (\\cos\\theta)$\n$P_n = (\\sin\\theta) \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) + (\\cos\\theta) \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n\nWe can factor out the constant $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 3. Set up the Eigenvalue Equation\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $\\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n \\psi = \\lambda \\psi$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $P_n$ and $\\lambda$:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ cancels from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 4. Solve for the Eigenvector Components\n\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n1)  $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n2)  $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b\\sin\\theta = a - a\\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis gives us the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The unnormalized eigenvector can be written by choosing a value for $a$. A convenient choice is $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$, which gives $b = \\cos(\\theta/2)\\tan(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nSo, the unnormalized eigenvector is:\n$\\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 5. Normalize the Eigenvector\n\nThe normalization condition requires that the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components is equal to 1:\n$|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$\n$\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n\nOur choice of components already satisfies the normalization condition. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$\\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### 6. Compare with the Options\n\nLet's review the given options:\nA) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$: Incorrect dimensions (contains $\\hbar$) and represents a specific direction, not an arbitrary one.\nB) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$: For the x-z plane, this would be $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$, which is not the correct eigenvector for an arbitrary angle $\\theta$.\nC) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$: This exactly matches our derived result.\nD) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$: Incorrect dimensions and is not a normalized vector for an arbitrary angle $\\theta$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
