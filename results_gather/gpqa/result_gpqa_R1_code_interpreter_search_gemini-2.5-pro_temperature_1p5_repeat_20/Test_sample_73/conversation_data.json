    "This problem deals with radioactive decay, which is governed by the principles of exponential decay. A key characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\".\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Model the decay process:**\n    The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) until time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability that the atom decays within a time `t` is therefore:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n2.  **Use the given information to find the decay constant `λ`:**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    Solving for the survival probability part:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n    We don't need to solve for `λ` explicitly. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the memoryless property:**\n    The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. Because the process is memoryless, the fact that it has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior.\n\n    Therefore, the problem is equivalent to asking for the probability that a *new* atom will decay within a 150-minute interval. We need to calculate `P_decay(150)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the required probability:**\n    We need to find `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    We can rewrite the exponent using the relationship we found in step 2:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Substituting the value from step 2:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    Now, we can calculate the final probability:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a simple calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of surviving 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n# This survival probability is P_survival(100) = 0.68\n\n# We want to find the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this is the same as\n# the probability of a fresh atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# This is P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150).\n\n# We know P_survival(t) = (P_survival(100))^(t/100).\n# So, P_survival(150) = (0.68)^(150/100) = 0.68**1.5\n\n# The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\n\nprint(f\"{prob_decay_150:.4f}\")\n```\nThe probability is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 52%\nB) 44%\nC) 48%\nD) 40%\n\nThe calculated value of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a problem about radioactive decay, which follows an exponential decay model. A fundamental property of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed without decaying.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:**\n    Let `P_survival(t)` be the probability that the atom *does not* decay within a time interval `t`. The decay process is described by the formula:\n    `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant for this specific type of atom.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Value:**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n\n    This means the probability of *surviving* for 100 minutes is:\n    `P_survival(100) = 1 - P_decay(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n    So, we have the relationship: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    The question asks for the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. Because the decay process is memoryless, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant. The atom doesn't \"age\" or get \"closer\" to decaying.\n\n    Therefore, the problem simplifies to: What is the probability that a brand-new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval? We need to calculate `P_decay(150)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    First, let's find the survival probability for 150 minutes, `P_survival(150) = e^(-λ * 150)`. We can relate this to the value we found in step 2:\n\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\n    Substituting the value from step 2:\n    `P_survival(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    The python script calculated this value:\n    `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\n    So, the probability of surviving 150 minutes is approximately 56.07%.\n\n5.  **Find the Decay Probability:**\n    The probability of decaying within 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150)`\n    `P_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n    This corresponds to a probability of 43.93%.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to the given option B.\n\n    A) 52%\n    B) 44%\n    C) 48%\n    D) 40%\n\n<<<B>>>"
