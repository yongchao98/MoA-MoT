    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating salts A and B is passed through three tubes. We can deduce the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H2O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H2O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H2O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO2 or SO2, which would form a precipitate (CaCO3 or CaSO3) and increase the mass of the tube. The fact that the mass did not change indicates that no such acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O2) or nitrogen oxides like N2O. The reaction is the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the reagents used.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   A very common inert gas produced in decomposition reactions of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N2).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nFrom the products, we can determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture. The total mass of the mixture is 7.20 g, which must equal the total mass of the products by the law of conservation of mass.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H2O produced.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 * Moles of H2O = 2 * 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol * 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H2O and in the oxidizing gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O from H2O = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Moles of O from the oxidizing gas = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining element must be nitrogen, which forms the final unreactive gas C (N2).\n    *   Assuming Gas C is N2, Moles of N atoms = 2 * Moles of N2 = 2 * 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.2 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n\n*   **Mass Check:** Total mass of elements = Mass(H) + Mass(O) + Mass(N) = 0.4 g + 4.0 g + 2.8 g = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our elemental analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts A and B are composed of H, N, and O. They are in an equimolar mixture. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A and `n` be the number of moles of salt B. The entire sample consists of `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\nFrom our elemental analysis, the `n(A) + n(B)` mixture contains:\n*   0.4 mol H atoms\n*   0.2 mol N atoms\n*   0.25 mol O atoms\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of A and one unit of B must have an atom ratio of H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get integers, we multiply by 20, giving a ratio of 8 : 4 : 5.\nSo, the combined chemical formula of (A + B) is **H8N4O5**.\n\nWe need to find two common nitrogen- and oxygen-containing salts (likely ammonium salts of oxoacids) that add up to this formula. Let's consider:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2): Formula is H4N2O2.\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3): Formula is H4N2O3.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(H4N2O2) + (H4N2O3) = H8N4O5.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, we can identify Salt A as **NH4NO2** and Salt B as **NH4NO3** (or vice versa).\n\n**4. Verify the Hypothesis with Decomposition Reactions**\n\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts matches the observed products.\n*   `NH4NO2(s) -> N2(g) + 2H2O(g)`\n*   `NH4NO3(s) -> N2O(g) + 2H2O(g)`\n\nIf we heat `n` moles of each salt:\n*   Products: `n` moles of N2, `n` moles of N2O, and (2n + 2n) = `4n` moles of H2O.\n\nNow, let's trace these gases through the tubes:\n1.  **Tube 1:** Absorbs `4n` moles of H2O. From step 1, we know this is 0.2 mol. So, `4n = 0.2` => `n = 0.05` mol.\n2.  Gases leaving Tube 1 are `n` mol N2 and `n` mol N2O (i.e., 0.05 mol N2 and 0.05 mol N2O).\n3.  **Tube 2:** No reaction.\n4.  **Tube 3:** The oxidizing gas N2O reacts: `N2O + Cu -> N2 + CuO`.\n    *   0.05 mol of N2O reacts, consuming 0.05 mol of O atoms (Mass = 0.05*16 = 0.80 g). This matches the mass increase of the tube.\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N2.\n5.  **Final Gas C:** The final gas is the initial N2 (0.05 mol) plus the N2 produced from N2O (0.05 mol). Total N2 = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches the moles of Gas C.\n\nAll calculations are consistent with A = NH4NO2 and B = NH4NO3, and n = 0.05 mol.\nA final check on mass: M(NH4NO2)=64 g/mol, M(NH4NO3)=80 g/mol.\nTotal Mass = 0.05 mol * (64 + 80) g/mol = 0.05 * 144 = 7.2 g. This is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH4NO2):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms (N)\n    *   4 Hydrogen atoms (H)\n    *   2 Oxygen atoms (O)\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH4NO3):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms (N)\n    *   4 Hydrogen atoms (H)\n    *   3 Oxygen atoms (O)\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nAlternatively, we found the combined formula for (A+B) is H8N4O5. The total number of atoms is 8 (H) + 4 (N) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\nThe correct answer is 17.\n\n<<<D>>>"
