    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also have O-H peaks, they are typically less broad and centered around 3300-3600 cm⁻¹. The position at 3000 cm⁻¹ overlapping with C-H stretches is classic for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid is found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretching vibration, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond. The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain at least two oxygen atoms.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene functional group (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as:\n    *   Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragment, [COOH]⁺, strongly corroborates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 4. Integrating the Evidence and Using the Degree of Unsaturation\n\nLet's synthesize the information:\n1.  The compound is a **carboxylic acid**, so its formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n2.  The compound contains a **C=C double bond** in addition to the carboxylic acid group.\n\nNow, we must choose between the two remaining options: C6H12O2 and C6H10O2. We can use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to do this. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n\nThe formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for formulas containing only C, H, and O).\n\n*   Our evidence shows the molecule contains:\n    *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) -> 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) -> 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining candidate formulas:\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option B):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    This formula has only one degree of unsaturation, which would be accounted for by the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not have an additional degree of unsaturation needed for the C=C double bond. This represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid).\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option C):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches our requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This represents an unsaturated carboxylic acid (like a hexenoic acid).\n\n**Final Conclusion:** All spectroscopic evidence points towards an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C6H10O2 is the only one that has two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2, accommodating both the carboxylic acid and the alkene functional groups.\n\n<<<C>>>"
