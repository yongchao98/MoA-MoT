    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** This value indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine would show none.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹) and fits well with a conjugated **ester (-COOR)**. A ketone or aldehyde is possible but less likely when considering all the data together.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet splitting pattern (n+1=3, so n=2) means this methyl group is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This is the upfield part of a classic **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet splitting pattern (n+1=4, so n=3) means this methylene group is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is significantly downfield, which is characteristic of protons on a carbon attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal, together with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an **ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.0 ppm):** This shift is typical for protons on a heteroatom.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This is a hallmark of **amine protons (-NH₂)**. The broadening is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the primary amine found in the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This region is characteristic of **aromatic protons** on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons on the ring, meaning it is disubstituted.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** The simple pattern of two doublets strongly suggests a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Shift Difference:** One pair of protons is at 7.0 ppm (more shielded) and the other is at 8.0 ppm (more deshielded). This indicates the two substituents have different electronic effects. The electron-donating group (-NH₂) shields its ortho protons (making them appear upfield, at 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing group (-COOR ester) deshields its ortho protons (making them appear downfield, at 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring to which these two groups are attached.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data and the molecular formula.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (wrong C=O stretch) and is meta-substituted (wrong aromatic NMR pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. The ester group is CH₃CH₂COO-. Its NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the C=O at a much more upfield position (~2.4 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm. The signal at 4.5 ppm is only explained by a -O-CH₂- group.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
