    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to analyze a set of experimental data from ¹H NMR and LC-MS for a newly synthesized peptide and find the most plausible explanation among the given choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Experimental Data:**\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Data:**\n        *   **Observation:** Two peaks for a single alpha-proton (Hα).\n        *   **Characteristic 1:** Similar chemical shifts. This suggests the two chemical environments are very similar, which is expected for isomers.\n        *   **Characteristic 2:** Combined integral is 1H. This confirms the two peaks originate from a single proton in the molecule, but this proton exists in two different states or species.\n        *   **Characteristic 3:** Roughly equal integrals. This implies the two species are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Constraint:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out. This is an important piece of information, telling me not to look for explanations involving J-coupling. This points towards the presence of two distinct chemical species.\n\n    *   **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n        *   **Implication:** There are two different chemical species in the sample that are separable by the chromatography column. They have different physical/chemical interactions with the stationary phase.\n        *   **Characteristic 1:** Equal intensities. This reinforces the NMR observation that the two species are in a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Observation:** Both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum (MS).\n        *   **Implication:** The two species have the exact same molecular weight.\n        *   **Observation:** The mass spectrum is consistent with the *expected* molecule.\n        *   **Implication:** The two species are not impurities with a different formula (like a precursor or a side-product with a different structure), but are isomers of the target peptide.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows both species have the *same mass* as the *expected product*. This option is inconsistent with the MS data. **Eliminate A.**\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images.\n        *   **Mass:** They have the same molecular formula, so they would have the same mass. This fits the MS data.\n        *   **Separability:** They have different physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they can be separated by standard achiral chromatography (LC). This fits the LC data.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are different compounds, they will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that protons in different chemical environments (like the Hα) would show distinct peaks for each diastereoisomer. This fits the NMR data.\n        *   **In the context of peptides:** How can diastereomers form?\n            1.  **Racemization:** If one of the chiral amino acids (e.g., an L-amino acid) racemizes during synthesis to form some of the D-amino acid, the final peptide will be a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., L-L-L... and L-D-L...).\n            2.  **Cis/Trans Isomerism:** The peptide (amide) bond has a high barrier to rotation. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. These isomers are a form of diastereomer (specifically, atropisomers or rotamers). This is especially common for peptide bonds involving proline, where the energy difference between *cis* and *trans* is small, often leading to ~1:1 mixtures. The environment of the Hα protons adjacent to this bond would be different in the *cis* and *trans* forms, giving two NMR peaks. These rotamers are often separable by LC.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This option is highly consistent with all pieces of experimental data.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This suggests a side reaction where an amino group is acylated twice, or something similar. This would create a product with a completely different structure and a higher molecular weight. This is inconsistent with the MS data showing the mass of the *expected* molecule. **Eliminate C.**\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They have identical chemical shifts and would produce a single set of peaks, not two. To see two sets of peaks, a chiral resolving agent would be needed. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers co-elute and cannot be separated. They would produce a single peak, not two. To separate them, a chiral stationary phase would be required. This is inconsistent with the LC data.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This option is fundamentally incompatible with both the NMR and LC observations. **Eliminate D.**\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   By eliminating options A, C, and D, option B is the only remaining possibility.\n    *   The explanation of a diastereomeric mixture perfectly aligns with all the evidence: two species that are isomers (same mass), but are physically distinct enough to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR. The specific phenomenon is likely cis/trans isomerism around a peptide bond or racemization at an alpha-carbon during synthesis, both of which result in a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
