    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n\n    The problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant for both. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, most terms cancel out when we take the ratio:\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a_1)) * ( (2 * a_2) / R_star) )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    The problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1.\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max). We can relate the semi-major axis (`a`) to the RV data.\n\n    First, the maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K_star) is related to the Doppler shift by:\n    K_star = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\n    This means K_star is directly proportional to Δλ_max. So, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\n    Second, for a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), K_star is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by the following formula (assuming edge-on orbit, sin(i)≈1, which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods):\n    K_star = (M_p / M_star) * v_planet = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K_star = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Let's rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K_star² = M_p² * (G / (M_star * a))\n    a = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K_star²)\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1. Note that G and M_star are constants and will cancel out:\n    a_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K_star2²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K_star1²) ]\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2² / K_star2²) * (K_star1² / M_p1²)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_star1 / K_star2)²\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Ratios:**\n    *   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5/7\n    *   RV semi-amplitude ratio: K_star1 / K_star2 = 3/4\n\n    Substitute these into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\n    a_2 / a_1 = (25/49) * (9/16)\n    a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n8.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** To compare with the given options, we compute the decimal value of the ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio a2/a1\n# Mass ratio squared: (Mp2/Mp1)^2 = (5/7)^2\n# RV amplitude ratio squared: (K_star1/K_star2)^2 = (0.03/0.04)^2 = (3/4)^2\nratio_a2_a1 = (5/7)**2 * (3/4)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the ratio a2/a1\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(ratio_a2_a1)\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.54\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_1), we use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K_star) is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max) by:\nK_star = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nThis shows that K_star is directly proportional to Δλ_max. Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\nK_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude is given by (assuming an edge-on orbit, sin(i)=1, which is a good assumption for transiting planets):\nK_star = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\na = G * M_p² / (M_star * K_star²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1. The terms G and M_star will cancel out as they are the same for both planets.\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2² / K_star2²) / (M_p1² / K_star1²)\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_star1 / K_star2)²\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Planet 1 mass (M_p1) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Planet 2 mass (M_p2) = 5 Earth masses\n*   RV ratio (K_star1 / K_star2) = 3/4\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\na_2 / a_1 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536, which rounds to 0.54. This value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
