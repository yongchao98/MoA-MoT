    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Premise:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This is a key assumption, meaning the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:** We want to count stars. A convenient way to do this is to consider a thin spherical shell of space around the observer (us).\n    *   Let the shell be at a distance `d` from us.\n    *   Let the thickness of this shell be an infinitesimally small amount `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this spherical shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax:** The question asks for the relationship in terms of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance (when `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds).\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   This implies `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Connect the Differentials:** We have an expression for `dN` that involves `dd`, but we need it in terms of `d(plx)`. We can find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)` by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Using calculus, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives us a substitution for `dd`:\n        `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases, which is correct. When considering the number of stars in a given positive range of parallax, we are interested in the magnitude.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Combine:** Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`.\n    *   Original equation: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * [- (1/plx²) * d(plx)]`\n    *   Simplify the expression: `dN = -4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx\". This is precisely the term `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = -4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Final Interpretation:** The term `dN/d(plx)` represents the density of stars as a function of parallax. Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax varies as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
