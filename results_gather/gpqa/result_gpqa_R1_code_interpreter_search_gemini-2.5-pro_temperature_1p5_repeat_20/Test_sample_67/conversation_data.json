    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin is described by the spin operator vector `S = (Sx, Sy, Sz)`.\n*   The magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the spin is in the eigenstate of `Sz` that corresponds to the lowest energy.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_i = -μ · B = -γS · (B k̂) = -γB Sz`.\n*   The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   To be aligned with the field, the system must be in the lowest energy state, which is `E_+`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B_new = -γS · (Bĵ) = -γB Sy`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time Evolution of the Expectation Value\nWe want to find the oscillation frequency of `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t)`. We can find `<Sz>(t)` by considering the time evolution of the spin expectation value `<s>`. According to Ehrenfest's theorem, the expectation value of the spin operator evolves according to the classical equation of motion for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field:\n\n`d<s>/dt = γ (<s> x B)`\n\nHere, `B = Bĵ` and `<s> = <Sx>î + <Sy>ĵ + <Sz>k̂`.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n`d/dt (<Sx>î + <Sy>ĵ + <Sz>k̂) = γ (<Sx>î + <Sy>ĵ + <Sz>k̂) x (Bĵ)`\n\nLet's compute the cross product:\n*   `î x ĵ = k̂`\n*   `ĵ x ĵ = 0`\n*   `k̂ x ĵ = -î`\n\nSo, `d/dt (<Sx>î + <Sy>ĵ + <Sz>k̂) = γB (<Sx>k̂ - <Sz>î)`\n\nThis gives a set of coupled differential equations for the components of `<s>`:\n1.  `d<Sx>/dt = -γB <Sz>`\n2.  `d<Sy>/dt = 0`\n3.  `d<Sz>/dt = γB <Sx>`\n\n### 4. Solve the Differential Equations\n*   From equation (2), `<Sy>(t)` is a constant. We can find its value at `t=0`.\n    `<Sy>(0) = <+z|Sy|+z> = 0`. So, `<Sy>(t) = 0` for all `t`.\n\n*   Let's define the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. The equations become:\n    1.  `d<Sx>/dt = -ω <Sz>`\n    3.  `d<Sz>/dt = ω <Sx>`\n\n*   To solve for `<Sz>`, we can differentiate equation (3) and substitute equation (1):\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = ω (d<Sx>/dt)`\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = ω (-ω <Sz>)`\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = -ω² <Sz>`\n\n*   This can be rewritten as the standard simple harmonic oscillator equation:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² + ω² <Sz> = 0`\n\n*   The general solution for `<Sz>(t)` is:\n    `<Sz>(t) = A cos(ωt) + C sin(ωt)`\n\n*   We use the initial conditions at `t=0` to find the constants A and C.\n    *   `<Sz>(0) = <+z|Sz|+z> = ħ/2`.\n    *   At `t=0`, `<Sz>(0) = A cos(0) + C sin(0) = A`. So, `A = ħ/2`.\n    *   From equation (3), `d<Sz>/dt` at `t=0` is `ω <Sx>(0)`. We know `<Sx>(0) = <+z|Sx|+z> = 0`.\n    *   So, `d<Sz>/dt` at `t=0` is `0`.\n    *   Differentiating our general solution: `d<Sz>/dt = -Aω sin(ωt) + Cω cos(ωt)`.\n    *   At `t=0`, this gives `d<Sz>/dt = -Aω(0) + Cω(1) = Cω`.\n    *   Since `d<Sz>/dt` at `t=0` is 0, we have `Cω = 0`, which means `C = 0`.\n\n*   Substituting A and C back into the solution for `<Sz>(t)`:\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) cos(ωt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t) = γ(ħ/2) cos(ωt)`\n\nSubstituting `ω = γB`:\n`<μz>(t) = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nThe time-dependent part of this expression is `cos(γBt)`. This describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function, which is `γB`.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is this angular frequency.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
