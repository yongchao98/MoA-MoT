    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactants and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester) with an ethyl group at the C4 position. The chiral center is this C4 carbon. The reactions yield different enantiomers: `(R)` from reaction A and `(S)` from reaction B.\n    *   The structure is: `O1-C6-C5-C4(Et)-C3-C2(=O)`\n    *   The chiral center C4 has four different groups attached: 1) H, 2) Ethyl (`-CH2CH3`), 3) `-CH2-C(=O)-O-` (part of the ring), and 4) `-CH2-CH2-O-` (part of the ring).\n\n*   **Starting Material (Options):** The proposed starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Let's decipher the IUPAC name to get the structure. \"Pentanoic acid\" means a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at C1.\n    *   `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-iBu`\n    *   This can be more simply described as a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n    *   The structure has one chiral center at C3, which will become the C4 in the lactone product. The substituents on this chiral carbon are: 1) H, 2) Ethyl (`-CH2CH3`), 3) `-CH2-COOH`, and 4) `-CH2-COOiBu`.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reactions**\n\nThis problem hinges on the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`.\n\n*   **Reaction with BH3 (Borane):** Borane (`BH3`, usually as `BH3Â·THF`) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids (`-COOH`) to primary alcohols (`-CH2OH`). It typically does not reduce esters (`-COOR`) under the same conditions.\n*   **Reaction with LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride):** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than `NaBH4`. It reduces esters to primary alcohols. While it can also reduce carboxylic acids, the reduction of esters is generally much faster. Therefore, in a molecule containing both functional groups, `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester.\n\n### **3. Trace the Reaction Pathways and Stereochemistry**\n\nLet's determine if the stereochemical descriptor (R or S) changes during each reaction sequence. This depends on whether the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority ranking of the substituents on the chiral center changes.\n\n**Let's assign priorities to the groups on the chiral C3 of the starting material:**\n*   Gp1: `-CH2-COOiBu` (isobutoxycarbonylmethyl)\n*   Gp2: `-CH2-COOH` (carboxymethyl)\n*   Gp3: `-CH2-CH3` (ethyl)\n*   Gp4: `-H`\nTo compare Gp1 and Gp2, we look past the `-CH2-C(=O)-` part. Gp1 has an `-O-iBu` group, while Gp2 has an `-OH` group. Comparing `-O-C...` with `-O-H...`, the carbon in isobutyl takes priority over hydrogen. Thus, **Priority(Gp1) > Priority(Gp2)**.\nThe ethyl group's `-CH2-` is attached to a `C`, while for Gp1 and Gp2, it's attached to a `C` that is then attached to three oxygens (counting double bond twice). Thus, **Priority(Gp2) > Priority(Gp3)**.\nThe final priority order for the starting material is: **`Gp1 > Gp2 > Gp3 > Gp4`**.\n\n**Let's assign priorities to the groups on the chiral C4 of the product lactone:**\n*   P'a: `-CH2-C(=O)O-` (ring portion towards the carbonyl)\n*   P'b: `-CH2-CH2-O-` (ring portion towards the ether oxygen)\n*   P'c: `-CH2-CH3` (ethyl)\n*   P'd: `-H`\nComparing P'a and P'b: The first carbon in P'a is part of a carbonyl `C=O`, while in P'b it's a `CH2`. More precisely, looking at the atoms attached to the second carbon in the chain from C4: for P'a, it's a carbon attached to `(O,O,O)`; for P'b, it's a carbon attached to `(O,H,H)`. Therefore, **Priority(P'a) > Priority(P'b)**. Comparing P'b and P'c(ethyl): The second carbon in P'b is attached to `(O,H,H)`, while in ethyl it's `(H,H,H)`. Thus, **Priority(P'b) > Priority(P'c)**.\nThe final priority order for the product is: **`P'a > P'b > P'c > P'd`**.\n\n**Pathway B: `B + BH3 -> (S)-product`**\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH3` selectively reduces the acid group (`Gp2`). `B (iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH)` becomes an intermediate hydroxy-ester `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The new alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl (`Gp1`).\n3.  **Stereochemical Analysis:** Let's see how the groups map from starter to product.\n    *   `Gp1` (ester part) becomes `P'a` (carbonyl part of the lactone).\n    *   `Gp2` (acid part) becomes `P'b` (ether part of the lactone).\n    *   `Gp3` (ethyl) remains `P'c` (ethyl).\n    *   Mapping: Starter Priority 1 (`Gp1`) -> Product Priority 1 (`P'a`). Starter Priority 2 (`Gp2`) -> Product Priority 2 (`P'b`).\n    *   Since the priority order of the groups is preserved, the stereochemical configuration is **retained**.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** For the product to be `(S)`, the starting material `B` must also be **(S)**.\n\n**Pathway A: `A + LiBH4 -> (R)-product`**\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH4` selectively reduces the ester group (`Gp1`). `A (iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH)` becomes an intermediate hydroxy-acid `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The new alcohol attacks the acid carbonyl (`Gp2`).\n3.  **Stereochemical Analysis:** Let's see how the groups map.\n    *   `Gp1` (ester part) becomes `P'b` (ether part of the lactone).\n    *   `Gp2` (acid part) becomes `P'a` (carbonyl part of the lactone).\n    *   `Gp3` (ethyl) remains `P'c` (ethyl).\n    *   Mapping: Starter Priority 1 (`Gp1`) -> Product Priority 2 (`P'b`). Starter Priority 2 (`Gp2`) -> Product Priority 1 (`P'a`).\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. Swapping the priority of two groups on a chiral center leads to the **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** For the product to be `(R)`, the starting material `A` must be **(S)** (since S inverts to R).\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same enantiomer, (S). This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
