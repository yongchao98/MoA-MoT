    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four listed exoplanets has the highest density. Density is mass divided by volume (ρ = m/V).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option Systematically:**\n\n    *   **Option (a): An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n        *   This is essentially a description of Earth itself.\n        *   We can use Earth's average density as a baseline. Earth's density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this ρ_E.\n        *   So, Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **Option (b): A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n        *   The density is explicitly given in the description.\n        *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n        *   This is very close to Earth's density, just slightly lower.\n\n    *   **Option (c): A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n        *   This describes a \"Super-Earth\".\n        *   Key concept: For rocky bodies with the same bulk composition, density is not constant with mass. As mass increases, the force of gravity increases. This stronger self-gravity compresses the material more tightly.\n        *   Think of it like stacking pillows. A single pillow has a certain fluffiness (density). A stack of five pillows will be compressed by the weight of the pillows above, making the bottom pillow much flatter and denser. The average density of the whole stack will be higher than the density of a single pillow.\n        *   Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth will be significantly denser due to this gravitational compression.\n        *   Conclusion: Density(c) > Density(a).\n\n    *   **Option (d): A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n        *   This describes a \"sub-Earth\".\n        *   Using the same logic as in option (c), but in reverse. A planet with less mass will have weaker self-gravity.\n        *   The materials will be less compressed compared to Earth.\n        *   Therefore, this planet will be less dense than Earth.\n        *   Conclusion: Density(d) < Density(a).\n\n3.  **Compare the Densities:**\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to compression)\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less compression)\n\n4.  **Formulate the Final Conclusion:**\n    *   By comparing the densities, we can establish the following order: Density(d) < Density(b) ≈ Density(a) < Density(c).\n    *   The planet described in option (c) clearly has the highest density.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Answer:** The planet from option (c) is the one with the highest density. The question asks to choose from the letters A, B, C, and D, where B corresponds to option (c).\n\n<<<B>>>"
