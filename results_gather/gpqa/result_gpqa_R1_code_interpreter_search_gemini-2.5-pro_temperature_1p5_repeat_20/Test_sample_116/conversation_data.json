    "A molecule shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each of the given compounds for chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl derivative. In many substituted biphenyls, if the four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are occupied by bulky groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted due to steric hindrance. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which can lead to chirality.\n    *   In this molecule, the ortho-positions are substituted with nitro groups (-NO₂) and methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃). Both are sufficiently bulky to prevent the rings from becoming coplanar.\n    *   The molecule is forced into a twisted, stable, non-planar conformation.\n    *   This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. As a result, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Chirality in this type of molecule often arises from a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one attached to the -OH group). It is bonded to the following four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It is a diphenyl ketone.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the carbon-oxygen double bond.\n    *   More importantly, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the molecule.\n    *   Any molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry is achiral, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   This molecule is planar. The plane containing all its atoms is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, it possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\n<<<D>>>"
