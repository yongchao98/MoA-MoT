    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n*   **What is tautomerism?** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where structural isomers interconvert rapidly. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Condition for keto-enol tautomerism:** A key requirement for a ketone (or an aldehyde) to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an \"alpha-hydrogen\". The process involves the migration of this alpha-hydrogen to the carbonyl oxygen and a shift of the pi-bond.\n\n    `R₂CH-C(=O)R' <=> R₂C=C(OH)R'`\n    `(keto form)       (enol form)`\n\n*   **Analysis of benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   Let's examine the alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=O groups). The alpha-carbons are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   Each of these alpha-carbons is part of a C=C double bond and is already bonded to another carbon within the ring. They do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n    *   Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   Let's examine the alpha-carbons. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha to two carbonyl groups.\n    *   Each of these carbons (C2, C4, C6) has two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Because it has multiple, highly acidic alpha-hydrogens (positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups), cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and very stable compound.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n*   **What is optical isomerism?** This occurs when a molecule is \"chiral,\" meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Condition for optical isomerism:** The most common cause of chirality in a molecule is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group).\n    *   This carbon is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (`-H`)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (`-OH`)\n        3.  A methyl group (`-CH₃`)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (`-COOCH₃`)\n    *   All four groups are different from each other.\n    *   Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). It will show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. It is the *trans*-isomer.\n    *   The molecule is built around a central `C=C` double bond.\n    *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) and is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it cannot show optical isomerism. (It does show *geometrical isomerism*, with its cis-isomer being dimethyl maleate).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
