    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Product from NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the reaction product using the provided 1H and 13C NMR spectra.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** A singlet for 3 protons in the aromatic methyl region (~2.3 ppm) strongly suggests a methyl group attached to the benzene ring. Combining this with the para-substitution pattern, we can identify a *p-tolyl group* (`CH3-C6H4-`).\n    *   **δ 197.7 (13C NMR):** This signal in the 13C NMR spectrum is definitive for a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically a ketone or aldehyde conjugated with a double bond or aromatic ring.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These are two doublets in the vinylic region, each representing one proton. The fact that they are doublets implies they are coupled to each other, indicating they are on adjacent carbons in a double bond (`-CH=CH-`). This forms an α,β-unsaturated system with the carbonyl group.\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** A singlet for 3 protons, likely another methyl group. Since it's a singlet, it must be attached to a carbon with no adjacent protons, such as the carbonyl carbon. This suggests an acetyl group (`-CO-CH3`).\n    *   **δ 28.4 and δ 21.3 (13C NMR):** These correspond to the two methyl carbons. δ 21.3 is typical for an aromatic methyl group (on the tolyl), and δ 28.4 is consistent with an acetyl methyl group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Putting all these pieces together—a *p-tolyl group*, a *trans C=C double bond*, and an *acetyl group*—we can construct the product molecule: (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, also known as **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    The structure is: `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CO-CH3`\n\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C11H12O.\n    (p-tolyl = C7H7) + (CH=CH = C2H2) + (CO = CO) + (CH3 = CH3) = C(7+2+1)H(7+2+3)O = C10H12O. Wait, my carbon count is wrong.\n    p-tolyl group is C7H7.\n    Structure: p-tolyl--CH=CH--CO--CH3.\n    C count: (6 for ring + 1 for tolyl-CH3) + (1 for =CH) + (1 for =CH) + (1 for CO) + (1 for acetyl-CH3) = 7 + 4 = 11 carbons. So C11.\n    H count: (4 for ring + 3 for tolyl-CH3) + (1 for =CH) + (1 for =CH) + (3 for acetyl-CH3) = 7 + 5 = 12 hydrogens. So H12.\n    O count: 1 from carbonyl.\n    Formula is C11H12O, which matches the starting material. The deduced structure is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Evaluate the Reactants**\n\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction involves Compound X (C11H12O), a non-nucleophilic base (DABCO), and heat. This suggests a base-catalyzed rearrangement or isomerization reaction. The starting materials are all epoxides. The reaction is a known base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyloxirane (an epoxide adjacent to a double bond).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    The product contains a *p-tolyl group*. Since the reaction conditions do not facilitate methyl migration onto or rearrangement of the benzene ring, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a p-tolyl group.\n\n    *   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Contains a *phenyl* group, not a p-tolyl group. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `-(CH=CH)-(C6H4)-CH3`, which contains the required *p-tolyl* moiety. This is a plausible candidate. Its formula is C11H12O.\n    *   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** Formula is C10H10O, which does not match C11H12O. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Contains a *phenyl* group, not a p-tolyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the Reaction Pathway for Option B**\n\nOnly option B has the correct carbon skeleton (the p-tolyl group) to form the observed product. Let's confirm the mechanism.\n\n1.  **Reactant:** 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane is a vinyloxirane: `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-[CH(O)CH2]`\n2.  **Deprotonation:** The base (DABCO) removes the most acidic proton, which is the proton on the epoxide carbon that is also allylic to the C=C double bond.\n3.  **Rearrangement:** The resulting anion undergoes rearrangement and ring-opening to form a dienolate anion: `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(O-)=CH2`.\n4.  **Tautomerization:** After protonation, the resulting dienol quickly tautomerizes to the more stable conjugated ketone, which is our identified product: **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\nThis reaction is a known transformation and provides a direct pathway from reactant B to the product identified by NMR. Therefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
