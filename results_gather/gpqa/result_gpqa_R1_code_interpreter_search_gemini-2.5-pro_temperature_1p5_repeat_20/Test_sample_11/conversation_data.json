    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary charged pion (Pi+) into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). To find the kinetic energies of the product particles, we will apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the framework of special relativity.\n\n**1. Decay Reaction:**\nThe decay process is given by:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\n**2. Given Information:**\n*   The Pi(+) meson is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero (p_pi = 0) and its initial kinetic energy is also zero.\n*   Rest mass energy of Pi(+) (M_pi * c^2) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of mu(+) (M_mu * c^2) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered to be a massless particle in this context (M_nu = 0).\n\n**3. Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   Initial Energy (E_initial) = Total energy of the stationary pion = M_pi * c^2\n    *   Final Energy (E_final) = Total energy of the muon (E_mu) + Total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n    *   Therefore: M_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\n\n    The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy (m*c^2).\n    M_pi * c^2 = (KE_mu + M_mu * c^2) + (KE_nu + M_nu * c^2)\n    Since M_nu = 0, this becomes:\n    M_pi * c^2 = KE_mu + M_mu * c^2 + KE_nu\n    139.6 MeV = KE_mu + 105.7 MeV + KE_nu\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    *   Initial Momentum (p_initial) = 0 (since the pion is stationary).\n    *   Final Momentum (p_final) = Momentum of the muon (p_mu) + Momentum of the neutrino (p_nu)\n    *   Therefore: 0 = p_mu + p_nu\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**4. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\nE^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2\n\n*   For the muon (mu+):\n    E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2\n\n*   For the neutrino (nu):\n    Since it is massless (M_nu = 0), the relation simplifies to:\n    E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 => E_nu = p*c\n    For a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (KE_nu = E_nu).\n\n**5. Calculation:**\nWe can use a standard formula for a two-body decay of a particle at rest (A -> B + C). The kinetic energy of particle B is given by:\nKE_B = [(M_A - M_B - M_C)(M_A + M_B - M_C)(M_A - M_B + M_C)(M_A + M_B + M_C)] / (8 * M_A^2)\nThis simplifies to a more convenient form. Let's solve it from the conservation laws we derived.\n\nFrom energy conservation, we have E_mu = M_pi * c^2 - E_nu.\nFrom momentum conservation, we have E_nu = p*c.\nSubstituting E_nu into the E_mu equation gives E_mu = M_pi * c^2 - p*c.\n\nNow, substitute this E_mu into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n(M_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2\n\nExpand the left side:\n(M_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (M_pi * c^2) * (p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2\n\nThe (p*c)^2 terms cancel out:\n(M_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (M_pi * c^2) * (p*c) = (M_mu * c^2)^2\n\nSolve for p*c:\n2 * (M_pi * c^2) * (p*c) = (M_pi * c^2)^2 - (M_mu * c^2)^2\np*c = [(M_pi * c^2)^2 - (M_mu * c^2)^2] / [2 * (M_pi * c^2)]\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values to find the energies.\n\n```python\n# Given values in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest mass energy of Pi(+)\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest mass energy of mu(+)\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (p*c)\n# p*c = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi) in units of MeV\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) is equal to its total energy (E_nu),\n# which is equal to p*c since it's massless.\nke_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy of the muon (E_mu) can be found from the energy-momentum relation:\n# E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)\ne_mu = (pc**2 + m_mu_c2**2)**0.5\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nke_mu = e_mu - m_mu_c2\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.79 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu+) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (nu).

    "This problem involves the two-body decay of a stationary pion. To find the kinetic energies of the resulting particles (muon and neutrino), we must apply the laws of conservation of energy and momentum within the framework of special relativity.\n\n**1. Principles and Initial State**\n\n*   **Decay Reaction:** Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu\n*   **Initial State:** The pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n    *   Initial momentum, `p_initial` = 0.\n    *   Initial total energy, `E_initial`, is its rest mass energy, `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n\n**2. Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum after the decay must also be zero.\n    `p_final = p_mu + p_nu = 0`\n    This means the muon (mu+) and neutrino (nu) must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this magnitude be `p`.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n    Here, `E_mu` and `E_nu` are the *total* relativistic energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation:\n`E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m * c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the muon (mu+):\n    `E_mu^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the neutrino (nu): In particle physics problems of this type, neutrinos are considered to be effectively massless (`m_nu = 0`).\n    `E_nu^2 = (pc)^2 + (0)^2  =>  E_nu = pc`\n    For a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, so `KE_nu = E_nu = pc`.\n\n**4. Solving for the Energies**\n\nWe have a system of equations to solve. We can express `E_mu` in terms of `E_nu` from the energy conservation equation:\n`E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy-momentum equation for the muon:\n`(m_pi * c^2 - E_nu)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nSince `E_nu = pc`, we can substitute `pc` with `E_nu`:\n`(m_pi * c^2 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the left side:\n`(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nThe `E_nu^2` terms cancel out. Now, we can solve for `E_nu`:\n`(m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 = 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * E_nu`\n`E_nu = [ (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c^2) ]`\n\nThis gives us the total energy (and kinetic energy) of the neutrino. We can then find the kinetic energy of the muon.\n\n**5. Calculation**\nLet's use the given values:\n*   `m_pi * c^2` = 139.6 MeV\n*   `m_mu * c^2` = 105.7 MeV\n\nWe will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n# This is also the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) since it is massless.\ne_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon can be found from the conservation of energy.\n# Total energy released = KE_mu + KE_nu\n# m_pi * c^2 = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + KE_nu\n# So, KE_mu = m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2 - KE_nu\nke_mu = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - e_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {e_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe calculation yields a kinetic energy of approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.78 MeV for the neutrino. Rounding the neutrino's energy to one decimal place gives 29.8 MeV.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The decay of the stationary charged pion (Pi+) into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu) is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in special relativity.\n\n1.  **Given Data:**\n    *   Rest mass energy of Pi+ (`m_pi * c^2`): 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest mass energy of mu+ (`m_mu * c^2`): 105.7 MeV\n    *   Rest mass of neutrino (`m_nu * c^2`): 0 MeV (assumed)\n    *   The initial pion is at rest, so its initial kinetic energy is 0 and its initial momentum is 0.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial momentum is zero, the final momentum of the system must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude (`p`).\n    `p_mu = p_nu = p`\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n    *   Initial Energy: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   Final Energy: `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n    Where `E_mu` and `E_nu` are the total relativistic energies of the muon and neutrino.\n    Therefore, `139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu`.\n\n4.  **Relativistic Energy Calculation:**\n    The total energy (E) is related to momentum (p) and rest mass energy (`m*c^2`) by `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n    *   For the neutrino (massless): `E_nu = pc`. The kinetic energy `KE_nu` is its total energy, so `KE_nu = pc`.\n    *   For the muon: `E_mu^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`.\n\n5.  **Solving the System:**\n    From the conservation of energy, we can write the muon's total energy as:\n    `E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu`\n\n    Substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n    `(139.6 - E_nu)^2 = (pc)^2 + (105.7)^2`\n\n    Since `E_nu = pc`, we can replace `pc` with `E_nu`:\n    `(139.6 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (105.7)^2`\n\n    Expanding the equation and solving for `E_nu` (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy) gives:\n    `KE_nu = E_nu = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6) â‰ˆ 29.8 MeV`\n\n    Now, we find the muon's kinetic energy using the energy conservation principle:\n    Total energy released as kinetic energy = `m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2 - m_nu * c^2`\n    `KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV`\n    `KE_mu = 33.9 - KE_nu = 33.9 - 29.8 = 4.1 MeV`\n\n    A more precise calculation was performed by the code:\n    *   `KE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV`\n    *   `KE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV`\n\n    These calculated values, when rounded, are **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino.
