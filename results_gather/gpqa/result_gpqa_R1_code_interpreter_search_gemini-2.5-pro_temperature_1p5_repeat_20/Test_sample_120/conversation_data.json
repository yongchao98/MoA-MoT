    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct product.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   **Core Structure**: `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is cyclohexene oxide. It's a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons. The IUPAC numbering for bicyclic systems starts at a bridgehead carbon (let's say C1), goes around the longest path (C2-C3-C4-C5), then the next longest path (C6, the other bridgehead), and finally the shortest bridge (the oxygen atom, numbered 7).\n    *   **Substituents**: There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**: The absolute configurations are given as 1R, 3R, 4R, and 6S. This defines a specific enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Visualize the 3D Structure of the Starting Material:**\n    To determine the course of the reaction, we need to understand the 3D arrangement of the atoms. We can establish the relative \"up\" or \"down\" positions of the substituents based on the given R/S configurations. Let's assume the plane of the cyclohexane ring is horizontal.\n    *   The epoxide is a `bicyclo[4.1.0]` system, meaning the fusion is `cis`. Let's assume the oxygen atom (O7) is on the \"top\" face (beta, or 'up'). This means the C1-O and C6-O bonds point 'up'.\n    *   Let's determine the orientation of the substituents needed to match the R/S labels:\n        *   **At C1 (1R)**: It has a methyl group. The priorities are O > C6 > C2 > Me. For the configuration to be 'R', with the O-bond 'up', the methyl group must be on the opposite face, i.e., 'down' (alpha).\n        *   **At C6 (6S)**: It has a hydrogen atom. The priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. For the configuration to be 'S', with the O-bond 'up', the hydrogen must be on the opposite face, i.e., 'down' (alpha).\n        *   **At C3 (3R)**: It has a methyl group. Following the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules for this chiral center within the ring, to get a '3R' configuration, the methyl group must be 'down' (alpha).\n        *   **At C4 (4R)**: It has a methyl group. Similarly, to get a '4R' configuration, the methyl group must be 'down' (alpha).\n\n    **Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n    *   Epoxide Oxygen: 'Up' (beta)\n    *   C1-Methyl: 'Down' (alpha)\n    *   C3-Methyl: 'Down' (alpha)\n    *   C4-Methyl: 'Down' (alpha)\n    *   C6-Hydrogen: 'Down' (alpha)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Reagent**: Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, effectively a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction**: The reaction is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n    *   **Regioselectivity Rule**: The problem states, \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\" We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n        *   C1 is bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon (considering the carbon skeleton).\n        *   C6 is bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen. It is a tertiary carbon.\n        *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic attack will occur here.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity Rule**: The problem states, \"inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is a typical Sₙ2-type mechanism. The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen).\n\n4.  **Predict the Product Structure:**\n    *   The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6.\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is 'up', so the Me⁻ attacks from the 'down' side.\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks. The electrons move to the oxygen atom.\n    *   An acidic workup (implied) protonates the resulting alkoxide at C1. The C1-O bond was 'up' and remains 'up', so the final product has an -OH group pointing 'up'.\n    *   At C6, inversion occurs. The original substituent (an H atom that was 'down') is pushed 'up'. The new methyl group from the reagent ends up in the 'down' position.\n    *   The configurations of the other methyl groups (at C1, C3, and C4) are not affected by the reaction.\n\n    **Summary of Product Structure (before IUPAC renumbering):**\n    *   At C1: OH is 'up'; original Me is 'down'.\n    *   At C3: Me is 'down'.\n    *   At C4: Me is 'down'.\n    *   At C6: New Me is 'down'; H is 'up'.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name and Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is numbered C1. We then number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locant numbers.\n    *   Our product has an OH at the original C1 position. So, `new C1 = old C1`.\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions: `old C1`, `old C3`, `old C4`, and `old C6`.\n    *   Let's see the locants when numbering from `new C1`:\n        *   Counter-clockwise: Me groups are at `1 (on C1)`, `2 (on old C6)`, `4 (on old C4)`, `5 (on old C3)`. Locants: (1, 2, 4, 5).\n        *   Clockwise: Me groups are at `1 (on C1)`, `3 (on old C3)`, `4 (on old C4)`, `6 (on old C6)`. Locants: (1, 3, 4, 6).\n    *   The set (1, 2, 4, 5) is lower than (1, 3, 4, 6). So, the correct IUPAC name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n    Now, we must determine the absolute stereochemistry (R/S) for the final product at the chiral centers (C1, C2, C4, C5).\n    *   **Product substituents ('up'/'down') with IUPAC numbering:**\n        *   **C1:** OH('up'), Me('down')\n        *   **C2 (old C6):** Me('down'), H('up')\n        *   **C4 (old C4):** Me('down'), H('up')\n        *   **C5 (old C3):** Me('down'), H('up')\n    *   **Assigning R/S configurations** (This involves visualizing the molecule in a chair conformation and applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules):\n        *   **C1:** Priorities are O > C2 > C6 > Me. The configuration is **R**.\n        *   **C2:** Priorities are C1 > C5 > Me > H. The configuration is **S**.\n        *   **C4:** Priorities are C5 > C3 > Me > H. The configuration is **R**.\n        *   **C5:** Priorities are C4 > C6 > Me > H. The configuration is **R**.\n\n    The resulting stereochemistry is **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
