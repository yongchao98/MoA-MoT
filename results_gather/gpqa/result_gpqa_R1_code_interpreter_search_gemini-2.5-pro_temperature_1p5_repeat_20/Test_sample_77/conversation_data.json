    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's break down the problem and derive the solution.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **Point charge `q`:** The source of the electromagnetic field.\n*   **Trajectory `s(t)`:** The position vector of the charge `q` as a function of time `t`.\n*   **Observation point `r`:** The point in space where we want to find the potentials.\n*   **Field observation time `t`:** The time at which we measure the potentials at point `r`.\n*   **Retarded time `tr`:** Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light `c`, the field measured at `r` at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, `tr`. This is called the retarded time. The signal travels a distance `d` from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n*   **Position vector at retarded time `s(tr)`:** The position of the charge when the field was emitted.\n*   **Vector `d`:** The vector from the source at the retarded time to the observation point. So, `d = r - s(tr)`. The magnitude is `d = |d|`.\n*   **Velocity `v`:** The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = d(s(t))/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   **Constants:** `c` (speed of light), `ε₀` (permittivity of free space), `μ₀` (permeability of free space).\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the observation time and the retarded time is given by:\n`t = tr + d/c`\n`t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Potentials (Retarded Potentials)\n\nFor a continuous charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')`, the retarded potentials are:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c` is the retarded time for a source point `r'`.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are:\n*   Charge density: `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))` (where `δ³` is the 3D Dirac delta function)\n*   Current density: `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals leads to the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The integration is non-trivial because the argument of the delta function `s(t')` is evaluated at the retarded time `tr'`, which itself depends on the integration variable `r'`.\n\n### 4. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe result of this derivation (a standard result in electrodynamics) is:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d(1 - d̂⋅v/c))]`\nwhere `d̂ = d/d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`.\n\nLet's manipulate the denominator to match the form given in the options:\n`d(1 - d̂⋅v/c) = d(1 - (d/d)⋅v/c) = d - (d⋅v)/c = (dc - d⋅v)/c`\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for V:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d⋅v)/c)] = (qc) / (4πε₀(dc - d⋅v))`\n\nThis matches the scalar potential in option C. The negative sign in `dc - d⋅v` is crucial. It represents a Doppler-like effect: if the charge moves towards the observer (`d⋅v > 0`), the denominator decreases, and the potential appears stronger. If it moves away (`d⋅v < 0`), the denominator increases, and the potential is weaker.\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\nA similar derivation for the vector potential yields:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qv / (d(1 - d̂⋅v/c))]`\n\nUsing the same simplification for the denominator:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qv / ((dc - d⋅v)/c)] = (μ₀qcv) / (4π(dc - d⋅v))`\n\nThis matches the vector potential in option C.\n\n### 5. Relationship between V and A\n\nWe can see a simple relationship between the derived potentials V and A:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ε₀) * v * [(qc) / (4πε₀c(dc - d⋅v))]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ε₀v) * V(r,t)`\n\nUsing the relationship `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, we get:\n`A(r, t) = (v / c²) * V(r, t)`\n\nLet's check if this relationship holds for the expressions in option C:\n`A/V = [(μ₀qcv) / (4π(dc - d⋅v))] / [(qc) / (4πε₀(dc - d⋅v))]`\n`A/V = (μ₀qcv * 4πε₀(dc - d⋅v)) / (4π(dc - d⋅v) * qc)`\n`A/V = μ₀ε₀v = v/c²`\nThe relationship holds.\n\n### 6. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) & B):** These options use the static potential `q/(4πε₀r)` for V, which is incorrect as it doesn't account for retardation and the motion of the source. Option A is also vectorially incorrect.\n*   **C):** `V(r,t) = (qc) / (4πε₀(dc - d⋅v))` and `A(r,t) = (μ₀qcv) / (4π(dc - d⋅v))`. These are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials, as derived above.\n*   **D):** This option has a plus sign `+` in the denominator `(dc + d⋅v)`. This is physically incorrect as it would imply the potential weakens as the charge moves towards the observer.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>"
