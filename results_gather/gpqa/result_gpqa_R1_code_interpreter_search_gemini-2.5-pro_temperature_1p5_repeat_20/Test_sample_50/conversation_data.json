    "This problem can be solved using the method of images in electrostatics.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System and the Method of Images\n\n*   We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V = 0).\n*   The charge `q` will induce a distribution of surface charge on the sphere.\n*   The method of images allows us to replace the complex system of the charge `q` and the induced surface charge on the sphere with a simpler equivalent system. This equivalent system consists of the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere.\n*   The image charge `q'` and its position `b` are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) becomes zero, satisfying the grounded condition.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThis placement of `q'` ensures that the potential created by both `q` and `q'` is zero at all points on the spherical surface `r=R`. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are identical in both the real system and the image system.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center. This work is done against the attractive force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\n\nThe force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is due to the attraction of the induced charges. In our image system, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n\n*   Force on `q` at position `x`: `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n    The distance between the charge at `x` and its image at `b=R^2/x` is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates an attractive force (towards the sphere).\n\n*   The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field:\n    `U = W_ext = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx = - ∫[∞, d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n    Using the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`:\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫[∞, d^2-R^2] du/u^2`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]_[∞, d^2-R^2]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1 / (d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula\n\nA more direct method uses the general formula for electrostatic energy for a system of charges and conductors: `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`.\n\nIn our case, the system consists of the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere. The potential of the sphere is `V_sphere = 0`. The energy is therefore half the product of the point charge `q` and the potential at its location created by all *other* charges (i.e., the induced surface charges on the sphere).\n\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nThe potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charges (`V_induced`) is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n\n*   `V_induced = V_from_q'(at d) = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n*   Distance from `q'` (at `b`) to `q` (at `d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n*   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n*   `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n*   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The factor of `1/2` is crucial and arises because the induced charges (and thus the potential they create) are themselves dependent on the presence of `q`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
