    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This indicates a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means this methyl group has no protons on the adjacent carbon atom.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to the carbonyl of an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with one proton (-CH-). This suggests an allylic methyl group, like CH₃-CH=.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.5 ppm):** This value is in the vinyl region, meaning the proton is part of a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet, 'd') and a set of three protons (giving the quartet, 'q'). This is consistent with a proton in a CH₃-C**H**=CH- fragment.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinyl region (-CH=CH-). The high chemical shift (downfield) suggests it's attached to a carbon that is also bonded to the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom (-CH=CH-O-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry.\n\n**2. Determine the Carbon Skeleton (Propenyl vs. Butenyl)**\n\nLet's count the total protons described by the signals, excluding the acetate methyl group:\n*   1.6 ppm (3H) + 5.5 ppm (1H) + 7.0 ppm (1H) = 5 protons.\n\nNow let's compare this to the possible structures:\n*   **Propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-):** Has 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 protons. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl group (e.g., CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-):** Has 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7 protons. This does not match the data.\n\nTherefore, the compound must be a **propenyl acetate**, which eliminates options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and B (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The geometry of the double bond is determined by the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons (the signals at 5.5 ppm and 7.0 ppm).\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm has a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The established rules for vinyl proton coupling are:\n    *   **Trans**-coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) typically have a large J-value of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis**-coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) have a smaller J-value of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely in the range for a **trans** double bond.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusions:\n*   The compound is an **acetate**. (from 2.1 ppm signal)\n*   The alkyl group is **propenyl**. (from proton count)\n*   The double bond has a **trans** configuration. (from J = 16.0 Hz)\n\nCombining these facts, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
