    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2      H\n                   C=C\n             H          CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** A *trans*-alkene undergoing a *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   **Intermediate Product:** The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These are two enantiomers. The two propyl groups are *trans* on the epoxide ring.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent performs acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by water, which is an *anti*-addition with respect to the epoxide ring (and overall, an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the original alkene).\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Let's trace the hydrolysis for each enantiomer of the epoxide intermediate.\n        1.  **(4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺:** Anti-attack by water at either C4 or C5 inverts the stereochemistry at the point of attack.\n            *   Attack at C4 (R) -> gives (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack at C5 (R) -> gives (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            These two products, (4S,5R) and (4R,5S), are the same molecule. This molecule has two chiral centers with opposite configurations and identical substituents, so it is a **meso compound**.\n        2.  **(4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺:** A similar anti-attack occurs.\n            *   Attack at C4 (S) -> gives (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack at C5 (S) -> gives (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            Again, the product is the same **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction starts with (E)-oct-4-ene and produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2      CH2CH2CH3\n                   C=C\n             H          H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition epoxidation.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** A *cis*-alkene undergoing a *syn*-addition results in a meso compound.\n    *   **Intermediate Product:** The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces **meso-(4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane**. This is a single, achiral meso compound. The two propyl groups are *cis* on the epoxide ring.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is the same *anti*-addition ring-opening reaction.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** We start with the single meso-epoxide. Attack can occur at C4 or C5.\n        *   **meso-(4R,5S)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺:**\n            *   Anti-attack at C4 (R) -> inverts configuration to (S), giving **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n            *   Anti-attack at C5 (S) -> inverts configuration to (R), giving **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   The two products, (4S,5S)-diol and (4R,5R)-diol, are **enantiomers**. Since attack at C4 and C5 is equally probable, they are formed in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction starts with (Z)-oct-4-ene and produces a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they **cannot be separated**. The racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**. The meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and **can be separated**. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will have different retention times, appearing as two separate peaks.\n    *   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique retention time and will be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
