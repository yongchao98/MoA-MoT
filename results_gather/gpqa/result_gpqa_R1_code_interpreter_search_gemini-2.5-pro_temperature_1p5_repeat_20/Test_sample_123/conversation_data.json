    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The number of unstable particles, N, decreases over time according to the formula N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ'), where N₀ is the initial number of particles and τ' is the mean lifetime of the particles in the observer's reference frame (the lab frame).\n    *   **Time Dilation:** Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (τ') is longer than their lifetime in their own rest frame (τ, the proper lifetime). This is described by the time dilation formula: τ' = γτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Travel Time:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius R and travel outwards. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is t_lab = R/v ≈ R/c.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** The fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is N/N₀. We can find this by substituting the travel time (t_lab) into the decay equation:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ')\n    Substituting t_lab = R/c and τ' = γτ, we get:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γ * cτ))\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Scenario:** We are given the following information for the first case:\n    *   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n    *   Detector radius, R = 30 m\n    *   Fraction of surviving particles, N/N₀ = 1/3\n\n    We can plug these values into our survival equation:\n    1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))\n\n    The term `cτ` represents the mean distance a particle travels in its own rest frame before decaying. It's a constant property of the particle type. We can solve for the constant ratio `R/(cτ)` which characterizes the experimental setup and the particle type.\n    ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n    -ln(3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n    ln(3) = 30 / (20 * cτ)\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Scenario:** Now, we want to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂, required for a different fraction of particles to survive.\n    *   Required fraction of surviving particles, N/N₀ = 2/3\n    *   Detector radius, R = 30 m (same detector)\n    *   Unknown Lorentz factor, γ₂\n\n    The survival equation for this scenario is:\n    2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n    -ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n    ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n5.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** We now have two equations:\n    (1) ln(3) = 30 / (20 * cτ)\n    (2) ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n    Let's rearrange both to solve for the constant term `30/(cτ)`:\n    From (1): 30/(cτ) = 20 * ln(3)\n    From (2): 30/(cτ) = γ₂ * ln(1.5)\n\n    Since both expressions are equal to the same constant, we can set them equal to each other:\n    γ₂ * ln(1.5) = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    Now, solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:** To get the numerical answer, we can use a calculator or a simple Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Lorentz factor from the first scenario\ngamma1 = 20\n\n# Calculate the new Lorentz factor, gamma2\n# gamma2 = gamma1 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))\ngamma2 = 20 * (math.log(3) / math.log(1.5))\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\nThe output of this calculation is approximately 54.18.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is ~54.18. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 54\n    B) 28\n    C) 40\n    D) 68\n\n    The closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem describes the decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n`N(t) / N₀ = exp(-t / τ')`\nwhere `N₀` is the initial number of particles, `N(t)` is the number of particles at time `t`, and `τ'` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame.\n\nDue to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame `τ'` is related to the proper lifetime `τ` (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n`τ' = γ * τ`\n\nThe particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the radius `R` of the detector is:\n`t = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, the survival fraction becomes:\n`N / N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nThe term `c*τ` is the mean decay length in the particle's rest frame, a constant for this type of particle.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n- Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n- Survival fraction, `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n- Detector radius, `R = 30 m`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n`-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n`ln(3) = 30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n\nThis equation relates the known quantities to the constant `c*τ`.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- Required survival fraction, `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n- Detector radius, `R = 30 m`\n- Unknown Lorentz factor, `γ₂`\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n`2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n`ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n**Solving for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂`:**\nWe now have two equations:\n1. `ln(3) = 30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n2. `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\nWe can set up a ratio between the two equations to eliminate the `30 / (c * τ)` term:\n`ln(3) / ln(1.5) = (30 / (20 * c * τ)) / (30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n`ln(3) / ln(1.5) = γ₂ / 20`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n\nUsing the provided code calculation output:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
