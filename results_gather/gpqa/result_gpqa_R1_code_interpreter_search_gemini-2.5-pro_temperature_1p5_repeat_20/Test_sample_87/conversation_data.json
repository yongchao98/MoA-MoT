    "*   **Analyze the experiment:** The experiment tracks a viral antigen (rotavirus capsid protein) from oral delivery to the immune system.\n*   **Location of Response:** The antigen reaches the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, a key site for initiating mucosal immunity.\n*   **Cellular Response:** Inside the Peyer's patches, a specific cell population is \"proliferating.\" This indicates an adaptive immune response where lymphocytes that recognize the antigen are selected and expanding.\n*   **Genetic Change:** Sequencing the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells reveals \"high variability.\" The variable heavy chain (VH) is part of the antibody (or B-cell receptor) that directly binds to the antigen. High variability in this specific region among a clone of proliferating cells suggests a process is actively introducing mutations to fine-tune antigen binding.\n*   **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B-cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) *before* a B cell encounters an antigen. The cells in the Peyer's patch have already undergone VDJ recombination to have a receptor in the first place. This process generates the initial repertoire, not the increased variability seen *during* an immune response.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), altering the antibody's effector function. It does *not* affect the variable region, so it wouldn't cause variability there.\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps clear pathogens. It is not a process that involves genetic changes in lymphocytes.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a biological mechanism that occurs in activated B cells proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates variants of the original B cell, some with higher affinity for the antigen. This process is directly responsible for the \"high variability\" observed in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of the proliferating B-cell population.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells within a Peyer's patch after antigen exposure is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
