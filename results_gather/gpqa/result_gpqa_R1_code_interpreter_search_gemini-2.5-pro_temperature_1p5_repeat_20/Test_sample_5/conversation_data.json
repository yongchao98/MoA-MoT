    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Potential**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often best to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's convert this potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n**2. Coordinate Transformation**\n\nThe relationships between Cartesian and polar coordinates are:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\n*   The term r^2 becomes x^2 + y^2.\n*   The term r cos(θ) is simply x.\n\nSo, the potential becomes:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k x^2\n\n**3. Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nNow, group the terms with x and y:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k x^2 + 3/2 k x^2) + 1/2 k y^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 k) x^2 + 1/2 k y^2\nV(x, y) = 2k x^2 + 1/2 k y^2\n\n**4. Identify the Physical System**\n\nThis potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent potentials: one that depends only on x and one that depends only on y.\n*   V_x(x) = 2k x^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 k y^2\n\nThis is the potential for an anisotropic two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. The motion in the x-direction is independent of the motion in the y-direction.\n\n**5. Solve the Separated Schrödinger Equations**\n\nThe total energy E of the system will be the sum of the energies from the x and y motions: E = E_x + E_y.\n\nThe energy levels of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential V(z) = 1/2 mω^2 z^2 are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω, where n is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nWe need to find the angular frequencies ω_x and ω_y for our system.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    V_x(x) = 2k x^2. We match this to the standard form 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2.\n    1/2 mω_x^2 = 2k\n    ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 k y^2. We match this to the standard form 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2.\n    1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k\n    ω_y^2 = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of E_{n_x} and E_{n_y}:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression by factoring out the common term ℏ*sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**7. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). This matches option B.\n\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
