    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. Since the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use this equation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:**\n    The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy state (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (`N_i`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the energy levels (constants for a specific transition).\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n    Let's define the excitation ratio as `R = N_j / N_i`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `R = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T)]` (where `C = g_j / g_i` is a constant)\n\n2.  **Applying to the Two Stars:**\n    We have two stars, star_1 and star_2, with temperatures T_1 and T_2, respectively. We can write the excitation ratio for each star:\n\n    *   For star_1: `R_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n    *   For star_2: `R_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n3.  **Using the Observational Data:**\n    The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the excitation ratio `R_1` is two times the excitation ratio `R_2`:\n\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `R_1` and `R_2`:\n\n    `C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Equation:**\n    The constant `C` (the ratio of statistical weights) cancels out from both sides:\n\n    `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n    To solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    `ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n5.  **Final Algebraic Steps:**\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Find a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n6.  **Substituting the Given Physical Constants:**\n    The problem provides the energy difference: `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    The value of the Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Let's compute the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\n    `ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n\n    Substituting this value back into our equation:\n\n    `1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n    This gives us the final relationship:\n\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n7.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    This result matches option B.\n\n    *   A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect sign.\n    *   B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - **Correct.**\n    *   C) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect form.\n    *   D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect denominator.\n\n<<<B>>>"
