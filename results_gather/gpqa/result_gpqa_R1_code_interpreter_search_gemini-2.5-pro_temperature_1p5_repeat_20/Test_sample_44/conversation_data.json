    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We are dealing with four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions. A key property of identical fermions is that they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n2.  **Define Single-Particle States:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The allowed energy levels for a single particle in this potential are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n    The problem provides the energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n\n    For each energy level `n`, a spin-1/2 particle can have two possible spin orientations: spin up ($m_s = +1/2$) or spin down ($m_s = -1/2$). Therefore, a complete single-particle quantum state is defined by the pair of quantum numbers (n, $m_s$). According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** fermions (one with spin up and one with spin down).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    The ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy for the system. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n    *   Place the first two fermions into the lowest energy level, n=1. They will have opposite spins. The energy contribution is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n    *   Place the next two fermions into the second lowest energy level, n=2. They will also have opposite spins. The energy contribution is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\n    The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible total energy. To get this state from the ground state, we need to promote a particle with the smallest possible energy jump. This is achieved by moving a particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   We promote one fermion from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration of the system is:\n        *   Two particles in n=1 (Energy: $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$)\n        *   One particle in n=2 (Energy: $1 \\times E_2 = 4E$)\n        *   One particle in n=3 (Energy: $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E$)\n\n    The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    $E_{1st\\_excited} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the third lowest total energy. We need to find the next possible energy value above the first excited state (15E). Let's examine the possible low-energy configurations:\n\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2). Energy = 10E.\n    *   **First Excited State Configuration:** (2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3). Energy = 15E.\n\n    Now, let's look for other excitations from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes (1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration becomes (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3).\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n    Comparing the energies we have found: 10E (ground), 15E (1st excited), and 18E. The energy 18E is the next lowest value after 15E.\n    Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe energies of the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
