    "This problem requires us to determine the total energy of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n### **1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines the unit of energy as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\n### **2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number *n* and the spin magnetic quantum number *ms* (which can be +1/2 for spin up or -1/2 for spin down).\n\nThis implies that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### **3. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy E₁ = 1²E = 1E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state (E_gs) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n### **4. First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is:\n    *   n=1: two particles\n    *   n=2: one particle\n    *   n=3: one particle\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state (E_1st) is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n### **5. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** {2 particles at n=1, 2 at n=2}. Energy = 10E.\n*   **First excitation (already found):** {2 at n=1, 1 at n=2, 1 at n=3}. Energy = 15E.\n*   Let's find the next possible higher energy states:\n    *   **Possibility (a): Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: {1 at n=1, 2 at n=2, 1 at n=3}\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$\n    *   **Possibility (b): Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: {2 at n=1, 2 at n=3}\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$\n    *   **Possibility (c): Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n        *   Configuration: {2 at n=1, 1 at n=2, 1 at n=4}\n        *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the first excited state has energy 15E, and the second excited state has energy 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
