    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and identify its products.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This creates a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, so its (S) configuration is retained.\n    *   The reduction of the prochiral ketone at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed. Their configurations will be (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C3. They are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and identify its products.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction Type:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" implies both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   Both ketone groups are reduced to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   New chiral centers are created at C2 and C4. For a symmetric molecule like this with two new chiral centers, we can have up to 2² = 4 stereoisomers, but we must check for meso compounds.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Because the molecule is symmetric, the (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) forms are identical and represent a single achiral meso compound, which possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (These two form a racemic mixture)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:** The enantiomeric pair are diastereomers of the meso compound. In total, three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   The total mixture contains five stereoisomers: two diastereomers from Reaction I and three stereoisomers (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound) from Reaction II.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomers), and meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will not be separated and will elute together as **one peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has a different polarity and will be separated, giving **a second peak**.\n        *   So, the products from Reaction II will produce a total of 2 peaks on a normal-phase column.\n    *   **Overall:** The products from Reaction I are C₇ ether-alcohols, while the products from Reaction II are C₅ diols. They have different molecular formulas, structures, and functionalities. It is extremely unlikely that any of the products from Reaction I will have the same retention time as products from Reaction II.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** Therefore, we sum the peaks from each group: 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers, as they form transient diastereomeric interactions with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times. Chiral HPLC also separates diastereomers. In essence, it can separate all different stereoisomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since a chiral column can resolve all different stereoisomers (both enantiomers and diastereomers), and we have five distinct stereoisomers in our mixture, we expect to see five separate peaks (assuming an ideal, effective column, which is the standard assumption in such problems).\n    *   **Total Peaks:** Each of the five compounds will give its own peak. So, we will observe **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclude and select the correct option.**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
