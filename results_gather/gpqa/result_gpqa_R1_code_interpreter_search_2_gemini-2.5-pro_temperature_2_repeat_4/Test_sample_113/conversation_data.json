    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the addition of a cyanide group (from NaCN) and a hydroxyl group to a ketone (butan-2-one). This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The cyanide ion (`CN⁻`) from `NaCN` is a nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This initial attack breaks the pi bond of the carbonyl group and forms an alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   To obtain the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this negatively charged oxygen atom in the alkoxide intermediate must be protonated (gain a proton, H⁺).\n3.  **Determine Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons.\n    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acidic solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water), which is an excellent proton source. This will protonate the alkoxide intermediate to form the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   `NaHSO₃` is sodium bisulfite. It can also add to carbonyls to form bisulfite addition products, but it is not the correct reagent to complete the cyanohydrin formation started by `NaCN`.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be `H₃O⁺`. This eliminates options B and D. We are left with options A and C.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction converts a nitrile group (`-C≡N`) into a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). This is a hydrolysis reaction of a nitrile.\n2.  **Analyze the conditions:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires water (`H₂O`), which is shown as a reactant. The reaction needs to be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   The product is a carboxylic acid, not a carboxylate salt.\n3.  **Determine Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is commonly used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate and yields the carboxylic acid directly under acidic conditions.\n    *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could technically catalyze the reaction, it would be extremely slow and inefficient compared to a strong acid like HCl. Therefore, HCl is the more suitable reagent.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B should be `HCl`.\n\n*   **Final Selection:**\n\n*   From the first reaction, we determined `A = H₃O⁺`.\n*   From the second reaction, we determined `B = HCl`.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct option is the one where A is `H₃O⁺` and B is `HCl`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
