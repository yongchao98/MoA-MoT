    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the initial reaction.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (N):** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This is a norbornadiene derivative, which is a common dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Reactant 2 Precursor:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium Iodide (NaI).\n*   **Conditions:** Elevated temperature.\n\nThe combination of a bis(dihalomethyl) compound with sodium iodide is a known method for generating a highly reactive diene *in situ*. Specifically, reacting 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with NaI produces **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**, an isomer of o-xylylene, sometimes called iso-o-xylylene. Let's call this diene **D**.\nThe reaction mixture contains diene **D** and dienophile **N** at elevated temperatures. This is a setup for a Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\nThe problem states that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used for every one equivalent of **N**. Norbornadiene **N** has two equivalent double bonds. This strongly suggests a double Diels-Alder reaction, where one molecule of **N** reacts with two molecules of diene **D**.\nThe product, **1**, is a symmetric bis-adduct.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product **1**.\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n\nAqueous acid is commonly used to remove acid-labile protecting groups. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) is a protecting group for alcohols that is readily cleaved under acidic conditions to yield an alcohol (-OH). The other parts of the complex molecule are likely stable to these conditions.\nSo, Product **1** (with a C7-O-tBu group) is converted to Product **2** (with a C7-OH group). The overall structure and symmetry are maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product **2**.\n*   **Reagent:** SO₃·pyridine complex in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n\nThis is a very mild and specific set of reagents for oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. Product **2** has a secondary alcohol at the C7 position of the norbornane core. Oxidation converts this -CH(OH)- group into a ketone (C=O).\nProduct **3** is therefore the C7-keto derivative of the bis-adduct.\n\n**Step 4: Heating of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product **3**.\n*   **Condition:** Heated at 150°C.\n\nProduct **3** is a complex molecule formed via two Diels-Alder reactions. Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, known as a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, is favored by high temperatures. Heating Product **3** will likely cause it to decompose back into its constituent parts.\nThe retro-Diels-Alder reaction of Product **3** will yield:\n*   Two molecules of the diene **D** (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene).\n*   One molecule corresponding to the central dienophile fragment. This would be **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n\nThe reaction does not stop here. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination at temperatures well below 150°C to extrude a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\nSo, the final products of the reaction sequence are **benzene**, **carbon monoxide**, and two molecules of the diene **D**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on \"final product 4\".\nLet's analyze the potential products:\n*   **Benzene:** Has 6 identical hydrogen atoms. So, it has **1** chemically distinct hydrogen. This is not among the options (4, 10, 8, 7).\n*   **Carbon Monoxide:** Has no hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Diene D (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene):** This is the only other organic product. It is plausible that the question refers to this molecule.\n\nLet's determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens in diene **D**.\n\n**Analysis of Diene D's Structure (C₈H₈):**\nThe structure of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene is a six-membered ring with double bonds at positions C1-C2 and C3-C4, and exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂) at positions C5 and C6. The molecule has C₂v symmetry assuming it is planar.\n\nLet's label the hydrogens and analyze their equivalence based on the C₂v symmetry (which includes a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes).\nLet's draw the structure to analyze:\n```\n     H(b) H(b)\n      C==C\n     /    \\\nH(a)-C      C-H(a)\n    |      |\n    C------C\n   //      \\\\\n H(c)=C       C=H(c)\n H(d)       H(d)\n```\nNo, this representation is misleading. A better representation:\n```\n      H(b)\n H(b)-C3=C2-H(b)\n     |    |\nH(a)-C4   C1-H(a)\n     \\   /\n      C5=C6\n     /   \\\n  H(c)   H(d) (attached to C5)\n  H(c)   H(d) (attached to C6)\n```\nLet's use a standard drawing:\nA six membered ring C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6. Double bonds are at C1=C2, C3=C4. At C5, there's an exocyclic double bond C5=CH₂. At C6, there's an exocyclic double bond C6=CH₂.\n\nThe protons can be grouped by chemical environment and symmetry:\n1.  **H1 and H4:** These are vinylic protons on the cyclohexadiene ring. They are equivalent by the C₂ rotation axis that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This gives **1 signal**.\n2.  **H2 and H3:** These are also vinylic protons on the ring. They are equivalent to each other by the same C₂ rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n3.  **Methylene Protons at C5 (=CH₂):** The two protons on this carbon are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic. One proton is \"cis\" to the C4 atom of the ring, and the other is \"trans\". They are in different chemical environments.\n4.  **Methylene Protons at C6 (=CH₂):** Similarly, the two protons on this carbon are diastereotopic.\n5.  The C₂ rotation axis makes the entire group at C5 equivalent to the group at C6. Therefore, the \"cis\" proton at C5 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton at C6. This gives **1 signal** for these two protons.\n6.  Similarly, the \"trans\" proton at C5 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton at C6. This gives **1 signal** for these two protons.\n\nIn total, we have four sets of chemically distinct (non-equivalent) hydrogen atoms:\n*   Set 1: {H1, H4}\n*   Set 2: {H2, H3}\n*   Set 3: {H_cis at C5, H_cis at C6}\n*   Set 4: {H_trans at C5, H_trans at C6}\n\nThus, there are **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product **D**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
