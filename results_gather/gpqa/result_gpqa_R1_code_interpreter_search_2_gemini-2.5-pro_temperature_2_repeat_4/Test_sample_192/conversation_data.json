    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n    *   **Given:** \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". Let's represent parallax by `plx`. This statement describes how the distribution of stars relates to their parallax. Parallax is a continuous variable, so \"number of stars\" must refer to a density or distribution function. The most natural interpretation is the number of stars per unit parallax, which we can write as `dN/d(plx)`.\n        So, the given relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    *   **To Find:** \"How does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This explicitly asks for the number of stars per unit distance, which we can write as `dN/dr`. We need to find its proportionality with distance `r`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Physical Relationship**\n    The parallax (`plx`) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (`r`). The standard definition is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    (when `plx` is in arcseconds and `r` is in parsecs).\n\n3.  **Relate the Two Distributions Using the Chain Rule**\n    We need to find a relationship between `dN/dr` and `dN/d(plx)`. We can use the chain rule for differentiation. The number of stars `dN` in a small range is the same regardless of whether we define that range in terms of distance or parallax.\n    `dN = (dN/dr) * dr`\n    `dN = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Therefore, we can write:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`**\n    Using the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve**\n    Now, substitute the known proportionalities and the derivative back into the chain rule equation. We are interested in proportionality, so we can ignore the negative sign (it just indicates that as `r` increases, `plx` decreases).\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n    The expression is currently in terms of both `plx` and `r`. We need it solely in terms of `r`. Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n    `dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n    Simplify the expression:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (r⁻²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance `r` changes in proportion to `r³`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
