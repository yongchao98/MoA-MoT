    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the given metric and the concept of area**\n\nThe problem provides a metric, which is a rule for measuring distances on a surface. The metric is given in Cartesian coordinates (x, y) as:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is of the general form $ds^2 = g_{11}dx^2 + 2g_{12}dxdy + g_{22}dy^2$. By comparing the given metric with the general form, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g$:\n$g_{11} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n$g_{22} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n$g_{12} = g_{21} = 0$\n\nThe metric tensor can be written as a matrix:\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe area of a surface is calculated by integrating the area element $dA$ over the entire surface. The area element is defined by the metric tensor as:\n$dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**2. Calculate the area element**\n\nFirst, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor $g$:\n$\\det(g) = g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}g_{21} = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) - 0 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2$\n\nNext, we find the square root of the determinant:\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2} = \\left|\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right|$\n\nThe term \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" and the form of the denominator $(4-x^2-y^2)$ implies that the surface is defined for $x^2+y^2 < 4$. In this domain, the denominator $(4-x^2-y^2)$ is always positive. Therefore, we can drop the absolute value bars.\n\nSo, the area element is:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**3. Define the region of integration**\n\nThe metric becomes singular when the denominator is zero, i.e., when $x^2+y^2=4$. This is a circle of radius 2. The term \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" indicates that we should calculate the area over the disk defined by $x^2+y^2 < 4$.\n\n**4. Set up and evaluate the area integral**\n\nThe total area A is the double integral of the area element $dA$ over the disk $D$ where $x^2+y^2 < 4$.\n$A = \\iint_{D} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nThis integral is much easier to evaluate in polar coordinates. We perform a change of variables:\n$x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n$y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\nThis implies $x^2 + y^2 = \\rho^2$.\nThe area element in Cartesian coordinates $dx \\, dy$ becomes $\\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$ in polar coordinates.\nThe region of integration $D$ ($x^2+y^2 < 4$) in polar coordinates is $0 \\le \\rho < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$.\n\nSubstituting these into the area integral:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\cdot (\\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta)$\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n$A = \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho \\right)$\n$A = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n\nThe integral with respect to $\\rho$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ approaches infinity as $\\rho$ approaches 2. We must evaluate it using a limit:\n$A = 64\\pi \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{0}^{b} \\frac{\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution $u = 4-\\rho^2$. Then $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, which gives $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2}du$.\nThe limits of integration also change:\n- When $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4-0^2 = 4$.\n- When $\\rho = b$, $u = 4-b^2$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$\\int_{4}^{4-b^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}du\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{4}^{4-b^2} \\frac{1}{u} du = -\\frac{1}{2} [\\ln|u|]_{4}^{4-b^2}$\n$= -\\frac{1}{2} (\\ln|4-b^2| - \\ln|4|) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln 4 - \\ln(4-b^2))$\n(We can drop the absolute value on the second term as $b \\to 2^{-}$ means $4-b^2$ is positive).\n\nNow, we take the limit as $b \\to 2^{-}$:\n$\\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln 4 - \\ln(4-b^2))$\nAs $b$ gets closer to 2, $4-b^2$ approaches $0^+$, and $\\ln(4-b^2)$ approaches $-\\infty$.\nSo, the limit is $\\frac{1}{2} (\\ln 4 - (-\\infty)) = +\\infty$.\n\nThe integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area is:\n$A = 64\\pi \\cdot (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\n**5. Analysis of the options**\nThe multiple-choice options are:\nA) $+\\infty$\nB) 0\nC) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)$\nD) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)$\n\n- Options C and D are functions of the coordinates (x, y), but the total area of a surface must be a single value (a number or infinity), not a function. Thus, C and D are incorrect.\n- Option B suggests the area is zero. However, the area element $dA$ is strictly positive everywhere inside the disk, so its integral over a finite region cannot be zero. Thus, B is incorrect.\n- Option A is $+\\infty$, which matches our direct calculation.\n\nTherefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.\n\n<<<A>>>"
