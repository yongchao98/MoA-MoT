    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the uncertainty, $\\Delta P_z$, of the operator $P_z$ for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Uncertainty**\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta A$ of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the standard deviation:\n$(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\nTherefore, $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$, where:\n*   $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$.\n*   $\\langle A^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A^2|\\psi\\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\nIn this problem, we need to find $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$.\n\n**3. Identify the Given Information**\n*   The matrix for the operator $P_z$ is:\n    $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The state of the system is given by the column vector (ket):\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The conjugate transpose of the state vector (bra) is:\n    $\\langle\\psi| = (|\\psi\\rangle)^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$\n\nFirst, apply the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, multiply the result by the bra $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n**5. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(1) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & (0)(0) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)(-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, apply the operator $P_z^2$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, multiply the result by the bra $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\nNow we plug the calculated expectation values back into the uncertainty formula:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nTake the square root to find the uncertainty:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n**Alternative Method (using eigenvalues and probabilities)**\nThe basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = \\hbar$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\\lambda_3 = -\\hbar$. The state $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$ can be written as $|\\psi\\rangle = c_1|u_1\\rangle + c_2|u_2\\rangle + c_3|u_3\\rangle$.\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$ is $p_i = |c_i|^2$.\n*   $p_1 = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$ (for eigenvalue $\\hbar$)\n*   $p_2 = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$ (for eigenvalue $0$)\n*   $p_3 = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$ (for eigenvalue $-\\hbar$)\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i \\lambda_i = (1/4)(\\hbar) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-\\hbar) = \\hbar/4 - \\hbar/4 = 0$.\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i \\lambda_i^2 = (1/4)(\\hbar)^2 + (1/2)(0)^2 + (1/4)(-\\hbar)^2 = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$.\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n$\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
