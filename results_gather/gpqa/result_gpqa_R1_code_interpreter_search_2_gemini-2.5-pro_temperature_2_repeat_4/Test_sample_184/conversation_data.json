    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by calculating the square of the Hamiltonian operator, $H^2$.\n\n1.  **The Hamiltonian Operator:**\n    The Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}$. Here, $\\varepsilon$ is a constant with dimensions of energy, $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector ($n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$), and $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n2.  **Squaring the Hamiltonian:**\n    Let's compute $H^2$:\n    $H^2 = ( \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} )^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2$\n\n3.  **Using the Pauli Matrix Identity:**\n    The Pauli matrices obey a very useful identity:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{A})(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{B}) = (\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B})I + i \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B})$\n    where $\\vec{A}$ and $\\vec{B}$ are any two vectors, and $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n4.  **Applying the Identity to our case:**\n    To find $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2$, we can use the identity with $\\vec{A} = \\vec{n}$ and $\\vec{B} = \\vec{n}$.\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = (\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n})I + i \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$\n\n5.  **Simplifying the expression:**\n    We use the properties of the unit vector $\\vec{n}$:\n    *   The dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1: $\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n} = |\\vec{n}|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n    *   The cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector: $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n} = \\vec{0}$.\n    \n    Substituting these into the equation from step 4:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (1)I + i \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{0}) = I + 0 = I$.\n    So, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})$ is just the identity matrix.\n\n6.  **Finding H²:**\n    Now we can substitute this result back into our expression for $H^2$ from step 2:\n    $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n\n7.  **Relating H² to the Eigenvalues of H:**\n    Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian $H$. This means there is a corresponding non-zero eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ such that:\n    $H |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n\n    If we apply the operator $H$ to both sides of this equation again, we get:\n    $H (H |\\psi\\rangle) = H (\\lambda |\\psi\\rangle)$\n    $H^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda (H |\\psi\\rangle)$\n    Since $H |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, we can substitute this into the right side:\n    $H^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda (\\lambda |\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n\n8.  **Solving for the Eigenvalues:**\n    We now have two expressions for $H^2 |\\psi\\rangle$:\n    *   From step 6: $H^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2 I |\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n    *   From step 7: $H^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n    \n    Equating these two expressions, we get:\n    $\\lambda^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n    \n    Since $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenvector, it cannot be the zero vector. Therefore, we can divide by $|\\psi\\rangle$ to get the equation for the eigenvalues:\n    $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n    \n    Taking the square root of both sides gives the possible values for the eigenvalues:\n    $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
