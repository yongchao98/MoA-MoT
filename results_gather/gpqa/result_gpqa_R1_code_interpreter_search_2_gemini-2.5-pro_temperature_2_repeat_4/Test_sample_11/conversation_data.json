    "This is a classic problem in relativistic kinematics, specifically a two-body decay problem. We need to use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) (`m_pi`): 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) (`m_mu`): 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The Pi(+) is stationary, so its initial velocity and momentum are zero.\n*   The neutrino (`nu`) is assumed to be massless, which is a standard approximation in this context. Therefore, `m_nu = 0`.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (`E_initial`):**\n    Since the Pi(+) is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    `E_initial = m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV`\n\n*   **Final Energy (`E_final`):**\n    The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`).\n    `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n    The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy (KE): `E = m*c² + KE`.\n    So, `E_final = (m_mu * c² + KE_mu) + (m_nu * c² + KE_nu)`\n    Since `m_nu = 0`, this simplifies to `E_final = (m_mu * c² + KE_mu) + KE_nu`.\n\n*   **Applying conservation of energy:**\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_pi * c² = m_mu * c² + KE_mu + KE_nu`\n    `139.6 MeV = 105.7 MeV + KE_mu + KE_nu`\n    This gives us our first equation:\n    `KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV` (Equation 1)\n\n### 2. Conservation of Momentum\n\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n*   **Initial Momentum (`p_initial`):**\n    Since the Pi(+) is stationary, its initial momentum is zero.\n    `p_initial = 0`\n\n*   **Final Momentum (`p_final`):**\n    The final momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon (`p_mu`) and the neutrino (`p_nu`).\n    `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`\n\n*   **Applying conservation of momentum:**\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This implies that the momentum vectors are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p_mu| = |p_nu|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n### 3. Combining Energy and Momentum\n\nWe will use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n\n*   **For the neutrino (massless):**\n    `E_nu² = (p_nu*c)² + (m_nu*c²)²`\n    Since `m_nu = 0`, we get `E_nu² = (p*c)²`, which means `E_nu = p*c`.\n    Also, for a massless particle, `E_nu = KE_nu`. Thus, `KE_nu = p*c`.\n\n*   **For the muon:**\n    We can solve for its total energy, `E_mu`.\n    From the energy conservation equation: `E_nu = m_pi*c² - E_mu`\n    Since `E_nu = p*c`, we have `p*c = m_pi*c² - E_mu`.\n    Now, substitute this into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n    `E_mu² = (p_mu*c)² + (m_mu*c²)²`\n    `E_mu² = (p*c)² + (m_mu*c²)²`\n    `E_mu² = (m_pi*c² - E_mu)² + (m_mu*c²)²`\n    `E_mu² = (m_pi*c²)² - 2*(m_pi*c²)*E_mu + E_mu² + (m_mu*c²)²`\n    Cancel `E_mu²` from both sides:\n    `0 = (m_pi*c²)² - 2*(m_pi*c²)*E_mu + (m_mu*c²)²`\n    Rearrange to solve for `E_mu`:\n    `2*(m_pi*c²)*E_mu = (m_pi*c²)² + (m_mu*c²)²`\n    `E_mu = [ (m_pi*c²)² + (m_mu*c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_pi*c²) ]`\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nNow we plug in the given values (in units of MeV):\n\n```python\n# Rest masses in MeV/c^2\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (m_pi**2 + m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# From conservation of energy, E_pi = E_mu + E_nu\n# E_nu = E_pi - E_mu\n# For a massless neutrino, E_nu = KE_nu\nKE_nu = m_pi - E_mu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n> KE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\n> KE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (when rounded).\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem involves a two-body decay of a stationary particle. We will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\nThe decay is given by:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\nWhere:\n*   `Pi(+)` is the pion (initial particle).\n*   `mu(+)` is the muon (product particle).\n*   `nu` is the neutrino (product particle).\n\n**Given:**\n*   The `Pi(+)` is stationary, which means its initial momentum is zero and its initial total energy is its rest energy.\n*   Rest energy of `Pi(+)`, `m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`.\n*   Rest energy of `mu(+)`, `m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`.\n*   The neutrino (`nu`) is considered to be massless, so its rest energy `m_nu * c^2 = 0`.\n\n### Step 1: Conservation of Energy\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n`E_initial = E_final`\n\n*   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy.\n    `E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n\n*   Final Energy (`E_final`): This is the sum of the total energies of the products. The total energy of a particle is `E = KE + m*c^2`.\n    `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n    `E_final = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + (KE_nu + m_nu * c^2)`\n    Since the neutrino is massless (`m_nu = 0`), its total energy is just its kinetic energy (`E_nu = KE_nu`).\n    `E_final = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2 + KE_nu`\n\n*   Equating initial and final energy:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2 + KE_nu`\n    `139.6 MeV = KE_mu + 105.7 MeV + KE_nu`\n    Rearranging gives us our first important relation:\n    `KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV` (Equation 1)\n\n### Step 2: Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n`p_initial = p_final`\n\n*   Initial Momentum (`p_initial`): Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n    `p_initial = 0`\n\n*   Final Momentum (`p_final`): This is the vector sum of the momenta of the products.\n    `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`\n\n*   Equating initial and final momentum:\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This tells us that the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n### Step 3: Using the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\nWe can express the total energy of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`) using the momentum `p`:\n*   For the neutrino (`m_nu = 0`):\n    `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0^2  => E_nu = p*c`\n\n*   For the muon:\n    `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nNow we can solve for the energies. Substitute `p*c = E_nu` into the muon's equation:\n`E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nFrom our energy conservation equation, we can write `E_nu` in terms of `E_mu`:\n`m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu  => E_nu = m_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n\nSubstitute this into the equation above:\n`E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the squared term:\n`E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi * c^2)*E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nThe `E_mu^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`0 = (m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi * c^2)*E_mu + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nNow, solve for the total energy of the muon, `E_mu`:\n`2*(m_pi * c^2)*E_mu = (m_pi * c^2)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n`E_mu = [ (m_pi * c^2)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c^2) ]`\n\n### Step 4: Calculation\nPlug in the rest energy values:\n`E_mu = [ (139.6)^2 + (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n`E_mu = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n`E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2`\n`E_mu ≈ 109.816 MeV`\n\nThis is the **total** energy of the muon. To find its **kinetic energy**, subtract its rest energy:\n`KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`\n`KE_mu = 109.816 - 105.7`\n`KE_mu ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n\nNow, we find the kinetic energy of the neutrino using Equation 1:\n`KE_nu = 33.9 MeV - KE_mu`\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - 4.116`\n`KE_nu ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
