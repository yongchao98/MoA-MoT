    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. We will analyze each compound for chirality. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons), but the overall molecular symmetry determines if the compound is chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: Cl-CH=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms directly attached to the double bond (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) and the two carbons of the double bond lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Since this molecule is planar, it has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex molecule, but its IUPAC name provides the necessary information.\n    *   The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E). The \"(3aR,7aS)\" part specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers.\n    *   The naming of a single stereoisomer with specific R/S configurations means that this molecule is just one of several possible stereoisomers. Unless this particular combination leads to a meso compound (which is highly unlikely for such a complex, asymmetric structure), the molecule is chiral.\n    *   A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as the substituents on C3 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other -CH(CH₃)COOH group). This symmetry allows for the possibility of a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. For molecules with two identical chiral centers, the (R,S) and (S,R) isomers are meso.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   Therefore, it is an **achiral** meso compound and is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) configuration is enantiomeric to the (2S,3S) configuration. These isomers do not have an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **chiral** and optically active. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are not superimposable.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The \"(R)\" in the name indicates that C1 is a chiral center and specifies its absolute configuration.\n    *   Let's verify C1 is a chiral center. The four groups attached to C1 are: -H, -OH, -CH₂-CH= (path to the double bond via C2), and -CH₂-CH₂-CH= (path to the double bond via C6). These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Since a single enantiomer, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, is specified, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The non-standard \"(1s,3s,5s)\" notation most reasonably implies that all three -OH groups have the same relative stereochemistry, meaning they are all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   In a chair conformation, this corresponds to all three -OH groups being either all axial or all equatorial.\n    *   In either conformation, the molecule possesses a threefold axis of rotation (C₃) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σᵥ). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**. Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Structure: (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The cyclopentyl ring contains only CH₂ groups, so no chiral centers there.\n    *   In the butanone chain:\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp².\n        *   C2 (-CH₂-) and C3 (-CH₂-) are bonded to two hydrogens each. Not chiral.\n        *   C4 (-CH(CH₃)₂) is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups (-CH₃), and the rest of the molecule. Since it has two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. It possesses conformations with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are the ones that are chiral.\n-   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: Inactive\n-   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: **Active**\n-   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Inactive (meso)\n-   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: **Active**\n-   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: **Active**\n-   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: Inactive\n-   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<B>>>"
