    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles:** The problem involves uncertainty in position (Δx) and asks for the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). This points directly to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **Choose the appropriate form of the Uncertainty Principle:** We are given the uncertainty in position (Δx) and want to find the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). We can start with the position-momentum uncertainty principle, as it directly uses the given Δx. The principle states:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n    *   Δp_x is the uncertainty in momentum in the x-direction.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π), approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n    The \"minimum uncertainty\" corresponds to the equality:\n    Δp_x_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n3.  **Relate uncertainty in momentum (Δp_x) to uncertainty in energy (ΔE):**\n    The energy (E) of a particle is a function of its momentum (p). The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp_x) using the following differential relationship, which is valid for small uncertainties:\n    ΔE ≈ |dE/dp_x| ⋅ Δp_x\n\n    To find dE/dp_x, we need the energy-momentum relation. The electron's speed (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), so we must use the relativistic formula for total energy:\n    E² = (p_x c)² + (m_e c²)²\n    where m_e is the rest mass of the electron.\n\n    Differentiating this equation with respect to p_x:\n    2E ⋅ (dE/dp_x) = 2p_x c²\n    dE/dp_x = (p_x c²) / E\n\n    We also know the relativistic expressions for momentum (p_x = γ m_e v) and energy (E = γ m_e c²), where γ is the Lorentz factor. Substituting these into the expression for dE/dp_x:\n    dE/dp_x = ( (γ m_e v) c² ) / (γ m_e c²) = v\n\n    This gives us a simple and powerful relationship: the rate of change of energy with respect to momentum is the particle's velocity.\n    Therefore, ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp_x.\n\n4.  **Combine the equations and calculate the value:**\n    Now we can find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE_min:\n    ΔE_min = v ⋅ Δp_x_min = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n    We have the following values:\n    *   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n    Substitute these values into the equation.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in J·s\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34\n# Speed of the electron in m/s\nv = 2e8\n# Uncertainty in position in m\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9\n\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum\n# delta_p_min = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy using the relationship Delta_E = v * Delta_p\ndelta_E_min = v * (h_bar / (2 * delta_x))\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{delta_E_min:.4e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n1.0546e-16\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.0546 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The calculated value is ΔE_min ≈ 1.05 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n    The options are:\n    A) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n    B) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n    C) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n    D) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\n    Our result is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning used to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle:** The problem deals with the \"uncertainty\" in position (Δx) and asks for the \"uncertainty\" in energy (ΔE). This immediately points to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **Relate Position and Momentum:** The most direct form of the Uncertainty Principle connects position and momentum:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n    *   Δp_x is the uncertainty in momentum in the x-direction.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π), which is approximately 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n    The problem asks for the *minimum* uncertainty, so we use the equality:\n    Δp_x_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n3.  **Relate Momentum and Energy:** We need to connect the uncertainty in momentum (Δp_x) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). For a particle with velocity v, the relationship between a small change in energy (dE) and a small change in momentum (dp) is given by:\n    dE/dp_x = v\n    This relationship holds for both classical and relativistic physics.\n    We can therefore approximate the relationship between uncertainties as:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp_x\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** Now we can combine the equations from steps 2 and 3 to find an expression for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE_min):\n    ΔE_min = v ⋅ Δp_x_min = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n5.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:** The final step is to plug in the given values into this combined formula.\n    *   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n    ΔE_min = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ [ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 10⁻¹⁰ m) ]\n    ΔE_min = (2 × 10⁸) ⋅ (0.527 × 10⁻²⁴) J\n    ΔE_min ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n    This calculation was verified using the provided Python code, which yielded the result `1.0546e-16` J.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is ΔE_min ≈ 1.0546 × 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n    Looking at the given options:\n    A) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n    B) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n    C) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n    D) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\n    The result is clearly on the order of magnitude of 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<A>>>"
