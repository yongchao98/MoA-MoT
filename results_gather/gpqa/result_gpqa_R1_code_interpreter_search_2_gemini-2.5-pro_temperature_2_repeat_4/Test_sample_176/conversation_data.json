    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Fundamental Physics:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $A$ is the surface area of the star ($A = 4 \\pi R^2$)\n    *   $R$ is the radius of the star\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n    *   $T$ is the surface temperature of the star\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    I can write the luminosity for each star:\n    $L_1 = 4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    The ratio is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information for Radius:**\n    The problem states: \"Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.\"\n    This means $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    So, the radius term in my ratio is $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n    The equation becomes: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n5.  **Analyze the Given Information for Temperature:**\n    To find the temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$, I need to use the other pieces of information. The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,obs}$).\n    So, $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$.\n\n6.  **Connect Observed Wavelength to Temperature:**\n    *   The temperature of a star is related to its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,emitted}$) by Wien's Displacement Law: $T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{max,emitted}}$, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    *   The observed wavelength is different from the emitted wavelength due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). The relationship for non-relativistic speeds is: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_r}{c}\\right)$, where 'c' is the speed of light.\n\n7.  **Formulate an Equation for Temperature Ratio:**\n    I can express the emitted wavelength in terms of the observed wavelength and radial velocity:\n    $\\lambda_{max,emitted} = \\frac{\\lambda_{max,obs}}{1 + v_r/c}$\n    Now, I can substitute this into Wien's Law:\n    $T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{max,obs} / (1 + v_r/c)} = \\frac{b (1 + v_r/c)}{\\lambda_{max,obs}}$\n\n    Since $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$, I can write the ratio of the temperatures:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b(1+v_{r1}/c)/\\lambda_{max,obs,1}}{b(1+v_{r2}/c)/\\lambda_{max,obs,2}} = \\frac{1+v_{r1}/c}{1+v_{r2}/c}$\n\n8.  **Substitute the Velocity Values:**\n    The problem gives:\n    *   $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s $= 700,000$ m/s\n    *   The speed of light, c, is approximately $3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n\n    Plugging these into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1 + 0/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Now I substitute this temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation from step 4:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}\\right)^4$\n\n    This calculation involves raising a number to the fourth power, so it's best to use a calculator or a short script for precision.\n\n10. **Execute Python Code for Precise Calculation:**\n    I'll write a Python script to compute the final value. It will use a more precise value for the speed of light for better accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Values from the problem\nR_ratio_squared = 1.5**2  # This is 2.25\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio (T1/T2)\nT_ratio = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio (L1/L2)\nL_ratio = R_ratio_squared * (T_ratio**4)\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n2.229158913926889\n\n11. **Final Conclusion:**\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.229. This value is closest to the option ~2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extra information not needed for the calculation based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's law.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_2$), which is $L_1/L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the formula:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    where $A$ is the star's surface area ($A = 4\\pi R^2$), $R$ is its radius, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is its surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can express the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    The ratio is therefore:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Radius Information:** The problem states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). This means the ratio of their radii is:\n    $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This requires relating the surface temperature to the observable properties given.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law** relates a star's surface temperature to its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{emitted}$): $T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{emitted}}$, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars.\n    *   The observed and emitted wavelengths are related by the **Doppler effect** due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$):\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + \\frac{v_r}{c})$\n        where 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for the emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{emitted} = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{1 + v_r/c}$.\n    *   Now substitute this into Wien's law: $T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{obs}/(1 + v_r/c)} = \\frac{b(1 + v_r/c)}{\\lambda_{obs}}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Temperatures ($T_1/T_2$):**\n    Using the formula derived above for both stars:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b(1 + v_{r1}/c)/\\lambda_{obs,1}}{b(1 + v_{r2}/c)/\\lambda_{obs,2}}$\n    Since the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$), the formula simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1 + v_{r1}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n\n7.  **Substitute the Velocity Values:**\n    *   $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^5$ km/s (speed of light)\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1 + 0/c}{1 + 700/c} = \\frac{1}{1 + 700/c}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the equation from step 4:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 700/c}\\right)^4$\n    The calculation gives a result very close to 2.23.\n\nThe provided Python code output `2.229107561148499` confirms this calculation. When rounding to two decimal places, this becomes 2.23. The information regarding the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe value 2.23 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
