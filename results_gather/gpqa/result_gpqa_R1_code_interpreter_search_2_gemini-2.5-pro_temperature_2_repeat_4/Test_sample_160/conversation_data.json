    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula depends on the nature of the colliding particles.\n\n*   **λ1: MFP of Gas Molecules:** This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. In this case, the particles are all of the same type (or a mix, but treated as a uniform gas) and are in thermal motion, described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\n*   **λ2: MFP of Electrons:** This refers to the average distance an electron from the high-energy beam travels before it collides (scatters) with a gas molecule.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Equation for λ1**\n\nFor a gas of identical particles in thermal motion, the mean free path is given by the standard formula from kinetic theory:\n\nλ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for gas molecule-gas molecule collisions. This is often approximated by σ_gg = πd², where `d` is the kinetic diameter of the gas molecule.\n*   The factor `√2` arises from averaging over the relative velocities of the colliding gas molecules, which all have similar speeds.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Equation for λ2**\n\nFor a beam of very fast, light particles (electrons) moving through a gas of relatively slow, heavy particles (gas molecules), the formula for the mean free path is slightly different.\n\nThe electrons from a 1000 kV TEM are moving at nearly the speed of light. The gas molecules, even at room temperature, are moving thousands of times slower. From the perspective of the fast-moving electron, the gas molecules are essentially stationary targets.\n\nWhen the target particles are considered stationary, the `√2` factor (which accounts for the target's motion) is omitted. The formula becomes:\n\nλ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n### **4. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n### **5. Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\n*   **σ_gg:** This is the kinetic cross-section for two molecules bumping into each other, dominated by short-range van der Waals forces.\n*   **σ_eg:** This is the cross-section for a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron scattering off a molecule. The interaction is Coulombic. A key principle in particle physics is that as the energy of the incident particle (the electron) increases, the scattering cross-section generally *decreases*. The very fast electron has less time to interact with the molecule's electric field, making a significant scattering event less probable. Therefore, it's physically expected that `σ_eg < σ_gg`.\n\nThis means the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is greater than 1.\n\nEven if we make the most conservative, simplifying assumption that the effective collision cross-sections are roughly equal (i.e., `σ_gg ≈ σ_eg`), the ratio becomes:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ ≈ √2 * 1\nλ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 1.414\n\nSo, under the most conservative assumption, λ2 is approximately 1.414 times larger than λ1. If we use the more physically accurate picture where `σ_eg < σ_gg`, then the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` would be even larger than 1.414.\n\n### **6. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe have concluded that **λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**. Let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   A) λ2 < λ1:  **Incorrect**. λ2 is larger than λ1.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: **Incorrect**. Our minimum value for the ratio λ2/λ1 is ~1.414, which is not less than 1.22.\n*   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: **Incorrect**. The underlying physics predicts they will be different.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **Correct**. Our derived relationship, λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁, comfortably satisfies the condition that λ₂ is greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ₁. The value 1.22 serves as a lower bound that is easily surpassed by the physical reality.\n\nThe core reason for the difference is that λ1 accounts for the relative motion between all gas particles (the `√2` factor), while λ2 considers the gas molecules as stationary targets for the much faster electrons. This alone makes λ2 larger than λ1 by a factor of ~1.414.\n\n<<<D>>>"
