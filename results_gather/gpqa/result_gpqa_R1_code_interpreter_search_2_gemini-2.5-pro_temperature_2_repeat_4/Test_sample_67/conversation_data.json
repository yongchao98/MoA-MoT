    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    Initially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the `+Z` direction. This means the spin of the particle is also aligned with the `+Z` direction. For a spin-1/2 particle, this corresponds to the spin-up state along the z-axis. We denote this state vector as `|+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [[1], [0]]` and `|-z> = [[0], [1]]`, the initial state at `t=0` is:\n    `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`\n\n2.  **Define the Hamiltonian for t > 0:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to point in the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude `B`. The Hamiltonian `H` for the interaction between a magnetic moment `μ` and a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ · B`.\n    Since the magnetic moment operator is `μ = γS` (where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio), the Hamiltonian for `t ≥ 0` becomes:\n    `H = -μ_y * B = -γ * S_y * B`\n    The spin-y operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix:\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the particle `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, and the solution is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z> = exp(iγBS_yt/ħ)`\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω_L = γB`. The expression becomes:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iω_L*t * S_y/ħ) |+z>`\n    Substituting `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iω_L*t * (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) |+z> = exp(i(ω_L*t/2)σ_y) |+z>`\n    We can use the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σ_k`, where `I` is the identity matrix. Here, `θ = ω_L*t/2` and `k=y`.\n    The evolution operator `U(t) = exp(i(ω_L*t/2)σ_y)` is:\n    `U(t) = cos(ω_L*t/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]] + i*sin(ω_L*t/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ω_L*t/2), sin(ω_L*t/2)], [-sin(ω_L*t/2), cos(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|+z> = [[1], [0]]`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ω_L*t/2), sin(ω_L*t/2)], [-sin(ω_L*t/2), cos(ω_L*t/2)]] * [[1],[0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ω_L*t/2)], [-sin(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n    In terms of the basis vectors, this is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ω_L*t/2)|+z> - sin(ω_L*t/2)|-z>`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Spin:**\n    We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`. Let's first calculate `<S_z>(t)`.\n    `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`\n    The operator `S_z` is `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    First, let's find `S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n    `S_z|ψ(t)> = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(ω_L*t/2)], [-sin(ω_L*t/2)]] = (ħ/2) * [[cos(ω_L*t/2)], [sin(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n    Now we calculate the inner product `<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`. The bra vector is `<ψ(t)| = [cos(ω_L*t/2), -sin(ω_L*t/2)]`.\n    `<S_z>(t) = [cos(ω_L*t/2), -sin(ω_L*t/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[cos(ω_L*t/2)], [sin(ω_L*t/2)]]`\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos^2(ω_L*t/2) - sin^2(ω_L*t/2))`\n    Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos^2(θ) - sin^2(θ)`:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * ω_L*t/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(ω_L*t)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(ω_L*t)`\n    Substituting `ω_L = γB`:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos((γB)t)`\n    This expression describes an oscillation of the form `A*cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω = γB`. The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which in this context is the angular frequency.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor Precession, where the expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the magnetic field direction with an angular frequency `ω_L = γB`, called the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
