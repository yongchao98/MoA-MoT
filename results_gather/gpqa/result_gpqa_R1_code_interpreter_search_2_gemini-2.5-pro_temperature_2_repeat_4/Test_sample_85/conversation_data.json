    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Materials and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Materials (A and B):** The options suggest the starting materials are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's determine the structure from this name.\n    *   The parent chain is a pentanoic acid, which means a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) group at C1.\n    *   There is an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) at C3.\n    *   At C5, there is a `5-isobutoxy-5-oxo` substituent. This describes an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`).\n    *   Putting it together, the structure is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid:\n        `iBuOOC-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        The numbers in parentheses show the standard IUPAC numbering for a pentanoic acid derivative.\n    *   The chiral center is at C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group, a hydrogen, a `-CH2COOH` group, and a `-CH2COOiBu` group.\n\n*   **Product:** The products are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This is a δ-lactone, a six-membered ring containing an ester linkage.\n    *   The name indicates the ethyl group is at position 4.\n    *   This lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. (`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`).\n    *   There is a discrepancy in the carbon chain length between the provided starting material name (a C5 diacid derivative) and the product name (which would arise from a C6 diacid derivative). However, the options only differ by stereochemistry, not by carbon count. This suggests the core of the problem lies in the stereochemical outcome of the reactions, and we should assume the reactions proceed as written, regardless of the carbon count mismatch. The functional group transformations are the key.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\nLet's trace the two reaction pathways:\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH₄` reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is not affected.\n    `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-acid (`5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`) cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the δ-lactone product.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine if the R/S configuration changes. This depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) before and after the reaction.\n    *   **Before reaction (Starting Material):** The groups on the chiral C3 are H, `-CH₂CH₃` (Et), `-CH₂COOH` (group X), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (group Y).\n        *   Comparing X and Y: Y (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has priority over X (`-CH₂COOH`) because at the third atom from the chiral center, Y has an oxygen bonded to a carbon (from the isobutyl group), while X has an oxygen bonded to a hydrogen.\n        *   Priority order: `(-CH₂COOiBu) > (-CH₂COOH) > (-CH₂CH₃) > -H`. Let's call this `P1 > P2 > P3 > P4`.\n    *   **After reduction (Hydroxy-acid intermediate):** Group Y becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH` (group Y'). Group X is unchanged.\n        *   Comparing X and Y': X (`-CH₂COOH`) now has priority over Y' (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) because the carbon in the carboxyl group is bonded to two oxygens.\n        *   New priority order: `(-CH₂COOH) > (-CH₂CH₂OH) > (-CH₂CH₃) > -H`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority of the two main groups attached to the chiral center has swapped. The group that was P1 is now P2, and the group that was P2 is now P1. When the priority of two groups on a chiral center swaps, the R/S descriptor inverts.\n    *   Therefore, this reaction path causes inversion of stereochemistry: `(S)-starting material → (R)-lactone` and `(R)-starting material → (S)-lactone`.\n    *   Since the product of Reaction 1 is the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material **A** must be the **(S)-isomer**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is not affected.\n    `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` → `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification under acidic workup to form the same δ-lactone product.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** Let's check the CIP priorities again.\n    *   **Before reaction (Starting Material):** Priority order is `(-CH₂COOiBu) > (-CH₂COOH) > (-CH₂CH₃) > -H`.\n    *   **After reduction (Hydroxy-ester intermediate):** The group `-CH₂COOH` becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The group `-CH₂COOiBu` is unchanged.\n        *   The priority order remains `(-CH₂COOiBu) > (-CH₂CH₂OH) > (-CH₂CH₃) > -H`. The relative priorities of the groups have not changed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the spatial arrangement and the priority order of the groups around the chiral center are preserved, the R/S descriptor is retained.\n    *   Therefore, this reaction path retains stereochemistry: `(S)-starting material → (S)-lactone` and `(R)-starting material → (R)-lactone`.\n    *   Since the product of Reaction 2 is the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material **B** must also be the **(S)-isomer**.\n\n### **3. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
