    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The annihilation produces four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. We are given that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" and we need to find the velocity of the resulting A particles.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nThis is a particle physics problem, and the fundamental principles to use are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after the annihilation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have one proton ($p$) and one antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). A proton and an antiproton have the same rest mass.\n*   **Energy:** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a common way to say its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of an antiproton is the same, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 \\approx 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Momentum:** Since both particles are assumed to be at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_i$) is zero.\n\n**4. Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$. They all have the same rest mass, $m_A$. We are given that the rest mass energy is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Momentum:** By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_f$) must also be zero.\n    *   $P_f = P_i = 0$.\n    *   To have a total momentum of zero, the four particles must fly off in directions such that their momentum vectors cancel out. Due to the symmetry of the problem (no initial momentum to define a preferred direction), we can assume the available energy is distributed equally among the four product particles. This means they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n*   **Energy:** The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. The energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Since all four A particles have the same mass and speed, they have the same energy, $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n**5. Solve for the Velocity ($v$)**\n\nNow, we equate the initial and final energies:\n$E_i = E_f$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nNow, plug in the known values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nFinally, we can find the velocity, $v$, from the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$. The velocity is usually expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.769c$.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated value of 0.769c is closest to 0.77c.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely, we can use a script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Known values\nm_p_c2 = 938.272 # Rest mass energy of proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300.0   # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# 1. Total initial energy (assuming particles are at rest)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# 2. Total final energy\n# E_final = 4 * E_A = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n\n# 3. Conservation of Energy: E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# gamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\ngamma = (m_p_c2) / (2 * m_A_c2)\n\n# 4.

    "This problem involves the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton, a process governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis\n\n*   **Particles:** We have a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. Let's denote this mass as $m_p$. From standard tables, the rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Energy:** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume the system is effectively at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{\\text{initial}}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    $E_{\\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n    $E_{\\text{initial}} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   **Momentum:** Since both particles are considered to be at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_{\\text{initial}}$) is zero.\n\n### 2. Final State Analysis\n\n*   **Particles:** The annihilation produces two particles of type $A^{+}$ and two of type $A^{-}$, for a total of four particles. We are given they all have the same rest mass $m_A$, with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_{\\text{final}}$) must be equal to the total initial momentum.\n    $P_{\\text{final}} = P_{\\text{initial}} = 0$\n    For the total final momentum to be zero, the momentum vectors of the four resulting particles must cancel each other out.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** Due to the conservation of energy, the total energy of the system remains constant.\n    $E_{\\text{final}} = E_{\\text{initial}}$\n    The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. The energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is its velocity.\n    Because the initial momentum is zero and the four final particles have the same mass, the energy must be distributed equally among them. This means they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n    Therefore, the total final energy is:\n    $E_{\\text{final}} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nNow we can set the initial and final energies equal to solve for the unknown velocity:\n\n$E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nNow, we plug in the given mass-energy values:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNext, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity, $v$. It's common to express this as $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1-\\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$ we found:\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.769c$.\n\nComparing this result with the options provided:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity of 0.769c is closest to 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>"
