    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the State Vector and Normalize It\n\nThe electron state `|alpha>` is proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nFirst, we write this as a vector in the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, where `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`.\nLet the unnormalized state be `|psi_un> = [(1+i), (2-i)]^T`.\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to find its norm and divide by it. The squared norm is `<psi_un|psi_un>`.\n`<psi_un|psi_un> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`= |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2`\n`= (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2)`\n`= (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is `N = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nSo, the normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nIn vector form:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator Matrix and Find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `0` otherwise. In the 2x2 `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this translates to:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix, `A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`lambda`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - lambda*I) = 0`:\n`det( [[-lambda, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -lambda]] ) = (-lambda)(-lambda) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n`lambda_1 = +hbar/2`\n`lambda_2 = -hbar/2`\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors.\n**For `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:**\n`(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [x, y]^T = (hbar/2) * [x, y]^T`\n`[y, x]^T = [x, y]^T` => `y = x`.\nThe eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]^T`. Normalizing it gives `|v1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n**For `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:**\n`(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [x, y]^T = (-hbar/2) * [x, y]^T`\n`[y, x]^T = [-x, -y]^T` => `y = -x`.\nThe eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]^T`. Normalizing it gives `|v2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the particle in a specific eigenstate is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state `|alpha>` onto that eigenstate.\n\n**Probability `P1` (for `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`):**\n`P1 = |<v1|alpha>|^2`\nFirst, find the inner product `c1 = <v1|alpha>`:\n`c1 = [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|) ] * [ (1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]`\n`c1 = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)*(1+i) + (1)*(2-i) ]`\n`c1 = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ 1+i+2-i ] = 3/sqrt(14)`\nNow, find the probability:\n`P1 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n**Probability `P2` (for `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`):**\n`P2 = |<v2|alpha>|^2`\nFirst, find the inner product `c2 = <v2|alpha>`:\n`c2 = [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|) ] * [ (1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]`\n`c2 = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)*(1+i) - (1)*(2-i) ]`\n`c2 = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ 1+i-2+i ] = (-1+2i)/sqrt(14)`\nNow, find the probability:\n`P2 = |(-1+2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n(Check: `P1 + P2 = 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`)\n\nThe probabilities are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated using the eigenvalues and their corresponding probabilities:\n`<A> = P1 * lambda_1 + P2 * lambda_2`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5)`\n`<A> = 4*hbar / 28 = hbar / 7`\n\nAlternatively, we can compute it using `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`:\n`<alpha| = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i]`\n`A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n`<A> = <alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ (2 - 2i - i + i^2) + (2 + 2i + i + i^2) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ 2 ] = 2*hbar / 14 = hbar / 7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of `A` are `9/14` (≈ 0.64) and `5/14` (≈ 0.36), and the average value of the operator `A` is `hbar / 7`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
