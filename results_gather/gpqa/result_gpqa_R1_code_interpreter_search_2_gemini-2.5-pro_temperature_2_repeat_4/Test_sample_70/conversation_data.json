    "The user has provided a new code output but the thinking process and the final result remain the same. The slight variation in the output is likely due to floating-point representation differences between environments but does not affect the outcome.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical laws:**\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit. Mathematically, P² ∝ a³. This can be rewritten as a ∝ P^(2/3).\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by T_eq ∝ ( (1-A) / a² )^(1/4), where A is the albedo and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n\n2.  **Simplify the relationships for this specific problem:**\n    *   The problem states that all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo (A). This means the only variable affecting the equilibrium temperature is the semi-major axis (a).\n    *   Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the semi-major axis: T_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) which simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/√a or T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).\n\n3.  **Combine the laws to find the relationship between Temperature and Period:**\n    *   We want to find the ratio of temperatures, T_4 / T_2. Using the relationship from step 2, we get:\n        T_4 / T_2 = (a_4)^(-1/2) / (a_2)^(-1/2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2).\n    *   Now, we use Kepler's Third Law (from step 1) to express the ratio of semi-major axes in terms of the ratio of orbital periods:\n        a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3).\n    *   Substitute this into the temperature ratio equation:\n        T_4 / T_2 = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2).\n\n4.  **Simplify the final expression:**\n    *   Using the rule of exponents (x^a)^b = x^(a*b), we get:\n        T_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2)) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3).\n\n5.  **Calculate the value:**\n    *   From the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   This means P_2 is proportional to 2, and P_4 is proportional to 3.5.\n    *   The ratio of their periods is P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5.\n    *   Now, we compute the final ratio:\n        T_4 / T_2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3).\n\n6.  **Interpret the Code Output:**\n    *   The python script calculated this exact value: `(2 / 3.5)**(1/3)`.\n    *   The output `0.8298...` confirms the result of the calculation.\n    *   Rounding this value to two decimal places gives approximately 0.83.\n\n7.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) ~0.69\n    *   B) ~0.83\n    *   C) ~0.75\n    *   D) ~0.57\n    *   The calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
