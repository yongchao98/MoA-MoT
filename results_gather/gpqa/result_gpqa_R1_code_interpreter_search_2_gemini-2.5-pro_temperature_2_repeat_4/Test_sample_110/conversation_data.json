    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. It involves an enolizable ketone (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one), a strong and sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK), and a Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one **α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. The t-BuOK base will abstract the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate. This regioselectivity is unambiguous.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C6 acts as a nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n\n4.  **Protonation:**\n    *   After the initial conjugate addition, an intermediate enolate is formed from the ethyl acrylate part.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated during the workup step to yield the final stable product, regenerating the ester carbonyl group.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The fragment added to C6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   The product molecule has the cyclohexanone ring with the following substituents: C1 is C=O, C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 now has a methyl group and a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n\n6.  **Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. The main chain is the propanoate, and the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent.\n    *   `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`: The name indicates that the cyclohexyl ring is attached to carbon-3 (the β-carbon) of the propanoate chain, which is correct.\n    *   Now, we need to name the cyclohexyl substituent itself. According to IUPAC rules for naming substituents, the point of attachment to the main chain is numbered as C1. In our product, this is the original C6 of the ketone.\n        *   **C1 of substituent:** Point of attachment. This carbon also has a methyl group (from the original 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one).\n        *   **Numbering the ring:** We number the ring to give the highest priority functional group (the ketone's C=O group) the lowest possible number. Numbering from C1 towards the carbonyl group makes it C2.\n        *   **C2 of substituent:** Contains the oxo (`=O`) group.\n        *   **C3 of substituent:** Corresponds to the original C2 of the ketone. It has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. The acidic component is 1-nitropropane, the base is potassium hydroxide (KOH), and the Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (α-carbon) in 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-C**H**₂-NO₂) are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group.\n    *   The strong base, KOH, removes one of these α-protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion). The nucleophile is `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 (the β-carbon) of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by the solvent, water (H₂O), to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The fragment from 1-nitropropane is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)−`.\n    *   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile after attack is `−CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Combining these gives the final structure: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n6.  **Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the molecule is named as a substituted alkanenitrile.\n    *   The carbon of the CN group is defined as C1. We number the longest carbon chain including the CN carbon.\n    *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Arranging the substituents alphabetically, the name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> **Correct**\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> Incorrect A, Incorrect B\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> Incorrect A, Correct B\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> Correct A, Incorrect B\n\nOnly option A correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
