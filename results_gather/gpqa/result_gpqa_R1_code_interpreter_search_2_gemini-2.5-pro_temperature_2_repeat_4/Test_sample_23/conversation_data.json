    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass percentage of hydrogen is given by `%H = (y * 1) / (12x + y) * 100`, using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1).\n    *   `14.28 = 100y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `1.7136x + 0.1428y = y`.\n    *   `1.7136x = 0.8572y`.\n    *   `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. The formula CnH2n corresponds to a saturated cycloalkane. The mass fraction for any CnH2n is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixtures**\n    *   Mixture **X** contains two equimolar liquids (A and B). It decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Mixture **Y** contains two equimolar liquids (C and D). It does not decolorize bromine water, so C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   The reaction `X → Y` is described as a disproportionation catalyzed by platinum upon heating. This suggests a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. Given that the products (Y) are saturated/aromatic and the reactants (X) are unsaturated, this is likely an intermolecular hydrogen transfer where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated.\n    *   Let's assume the reaction is `A + B → C + D`, where A and B are the components of X, and C and D are the components of Y. To get an equimolar mixture Y, the stoichiometry must be 1:1.\n    *   Since one part gets hydrogenated and the other dehydrogenated, let's say B is hydrogenated to C (saturated), and A is dehydrogenated to D (more unsaturated or aromatic).\n    *   `B + [H] → C` (C is saturated).\n    *   `A - [H] → D`.\n    *   However, mixture Y (C and D) does *not* decolorize bromine water. This means D must also be a saturated compound or an aromatic compound like benzene, which does not react with bromine water. For D to be saturated is impossible if it comes from the dehydrogenation of A. Therefore, D must be an aromatic compound. The simplest stable aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   If D is benzene (C6H6), then C must be the corresponding saturated cycloalkane, cyclohexane (C6H12), to maintain the same carbon skeleton across all species (since hydrogenation of both X and Y yields a single product Z).\n    *   So, we hypothesize: `Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}`. This mixture is indeed made of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water.\n\n3.  **Confirm the Identity of Z and the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y ({benzene, cyclohexane}) under severe conditions would convert benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in pure cyclohexane. Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Let's check the other conditions for Z: it is widely used as a solvent, and its H mass fraction is 14.28%. Cyclohexane fits these perfectly.\n    *   The problem states \"hydrogenation ... gives **only one** substance ... Z\". This is a critical clue. If we had chosen a substituted cycloalkane like methylcyclohexane (from a C7 skeleton), its precursor toluene upon hydrogenation would produce methylcyclohexane, which is chiral and exists as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. This is not strictly \"one substance\". Hydrogenation of xylenes would give diastereomeric mixtures. The only way to guarantee an achiral, single-substance product is to start with an unsubstituted ring. This confirms the C6 skeleton is the correct choice.\n    *   Therefore, C = Cyclohexane (Z) and D = Benzene.\n\n4.  **Determine the Components of Mixture X**\n    *   The reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer: `A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)`.\n    *   This is a 1:1 reaction producing an equimolar mixture Y, as stated.\n    *   The reaction must be balanced in terms of atoms. The total number of hydrogens in the reactants (one molecule of A and one of B) must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms = H atoms in benzene + H atoms in cyclohexane = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   So, `H(A) + H(B) = 18`.\n    *   A and B must be C6 unsaturated rings that hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   In the reaction, A is dehydrogenated to benzene, and B is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   `A → C6H6`. The most likely precursor is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which loses 2H.\n    *   `B → C6H12`. The most likely precursor is a cyclohexene (C6H10), which gains 2H.\n    *   The number of hydrogens transferred is balanced (2H lost by A = 2H gained by B).\n    *   So, **A = cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** and **B = cyclohexene (C6H10)**.\n    *   `H(A) + H(B) = 8 + 10 = 18`. This matches our calculation.\n    *   The problem states X has no conjugated bonds. This means the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not the conjugated 1,3-isomer.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   Mixture X consists of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H8) + (H atoms in C6H10) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
