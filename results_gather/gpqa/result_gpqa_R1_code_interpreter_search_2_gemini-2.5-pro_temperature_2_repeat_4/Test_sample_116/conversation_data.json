    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. It occurs when a compound is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be chiral are the presence of a chiral center or the presence of axial chirality (atropisomerism). A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The key feature here is the substitution pattern. All four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' relative to the bond connecting the rings) are occupied by large groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). These bulky groups sterically hinder the rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   Because free rotation is not possible, the two phenyl rings are forced into a non-planar, twisted conformation. This twisted molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. It is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to check for a chiral center. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group):\n        *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n        *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3).\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon atom are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R-methyl lactate and S-methyl lactate).\n\n*   **3. benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It's a ketone with a carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, the molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. It is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. A planar molecule always has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). It also possesses a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Summary:**\n    *   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n    *   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n    *   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n    *   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
