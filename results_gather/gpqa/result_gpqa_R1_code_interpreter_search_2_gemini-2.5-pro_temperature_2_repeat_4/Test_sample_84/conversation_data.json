    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I'll write out the ratio for T_eq1 / T_eq2:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both terms. It also explicitly states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1` = `A2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star) )`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n    The problem now boils down to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, specifically `sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n\n5.  **Find a way to determine `a2 / a1`:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method: the Doppler shifts (Δλ) induced by each planet. This is the key to finding `a`.\n\n6.  **Relate Doppler Shift to RV Amplitude (K):** The Doppler shift formula is `Δλ / λ = v_r / c`, where `v_r` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light. The maximum periodic shift given in the problem corresponds to the amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted by `K`.\n    `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ)`\n\n    Let's find the ratio `K1 / K2`:\n    `K1 = c * (Δλ1 / λ)`\n    `K2 = c * (Δλ2 / λ)`\n    `K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ) / (c * Δλ2 / λ) = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n\n    Using the given values:\n    `Δλ1 = 0.03 Å`\n    `Δλ2 = 0.04 Å`\n    `K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n7.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** The formula for the RV amplitude `K` for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / (M_star + M_p)) * sqrt(G * (M_star + M_p) / a)`\n    Where `M_p` is planet mass, `M_star` is star mass, `i` is orbital inclination, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `a` is the semi-major axis.\n\n8.  **Simplify the `K` formula:**\n    *   The problem states the planets are detected by the *transit method*, which implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. Therefore, the inclination `i` is close to 90°, and `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   The planet masses (7 and 5 Earth masses) are very small compared to the star's mass (1.5 solar masses, which is about 500,000 Earth masses). Thus, we can make the approximation `(M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star`.\n\n    The simplified formula becomes:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)`\n\n9.  **Use the simplified `K` formula to find `a2 / a1`:** Let's write the ratio `K1 / K2` using this formula:\n    `K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a1) ] / [ (M_p2 / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a2) ]`\n\n    The terms `sqrt(M_star)` and `sqrt(G)` cancel out:\n    `K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (sqrt(1/a1) / sqrt(1/a2))`\n    `K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n10. **Isolate `sqrt(a2 / a1)`:** This is the term we need for the temperature ratio.\n    `sqrt(a2 / a1) = (K1 / K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`\n\n11. **Connect back to the Temperature Ratio:**\n    From step 4, we know `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n    Therefore:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (K1 / K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`\n\n12. **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   `K1 / K2 = 3 / 4` (from step 6)\n    *   `M_p1 = 7 M_earth`\n    *   `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n    *   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3 / 4) * (5 / 7) = 15 / 28`\n\n13. **Final Calculation:** I'll use Python to get the decimal value.\n```python\n# Ratio of radial velocity amplitudes\nK1_over_K2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Ratio of planet masses\nM_p2_over_M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the product of these two ratios\nT_eq_ratio = K1_over_K2 * M_p2_over_M_p1\n\nprint(T_eq_ratio)\n```\n>0.5357142857142857\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357, which rounds to 0.54 or 0.53. This corresponds to option D. The extra information given in the problem (star's R, T_eff; planets' radii) is not needed for the calculation of the ratio, as those terms cancel out.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`).\n\n**2. Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]`\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are identical. The problem states that the albedo is the same for both planets (`A1 = A2`). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\nThe problem now simplifies to finding the ratio of the orbital semi-major axes.\n\n**3. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe problem provides the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) caused by each planet. These shifts are directly related to the radial velocity (RV) amplitude, `K`, by the formula:\n\n`K = c * (Δλ_max / λ)`\n\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nLet's find the ratio of the RV amplitudes (`K1 / K2`):\n\n`K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ) / (c * Δλ2 / λ) = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n`K1 / K2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4`\n\n**4. Link RV Amplitude to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe RV amplitude `K` is also given by:\n\n`K = (M_p * sin(i) / (M_star + M_p)) * sqrt(G * (M_star + M_p) / a)`\n\nwhere `M_p` is the planet mass, `M_star` is the star mass, `G` is the gravitational constant, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `a` is the semi-major axis.\n\nWe can simplify this formula:\n*   The planets are detected via the transit method, which means their orbital plane is nearly edge-on to us, so the inclination `i` is close to 90°, and `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n*   The planet masses (`M_p` ≈ 5-7 Earth masses) are much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star` = 1.5 Solar masses ≈ 500,000 Earth masses). Thus, we can approximate `(M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star`.\n\nThe simplified formula becomes:\n\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes**\n\nLet's write the ratio `K1 / K2` using this simplified formula:\n\n`K1 / K2 = [(M_p1 / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a1)] / [(M_p2 / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a2)]`\n\nThe terms `sqrt(G)` and `sqrt(M_star)` cancel out:\n\n`K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n**6. Combine and Solve**\n\nWe now have two expressions for the ratios, one from the temperature (`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`) and one from the RV data (`K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)`).\n\nBy rearranging the RV data equation, we get:\n\n`sqrt(a2 / a1) = (K1 / K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`\n\nSince `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`, we can substitute the values:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (K1 / K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3/4) * (5 Earth masses / 7 Earth masses)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15 / 28`\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\nLet's compute the final decimal value.\n```python\n# Ratio of Doppler shifts gives the ratio of RV amplitudes (K1/K2)\nK1_over_K2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Ratio of planet masses (M_p2/M_p1)\nM_p2_over_M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n# The equilibrium temperature ratio is T_eq1/T_eq2 = (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1)\ntemp_ratio = K1_over_K2 * M_p2_over_M_p1\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n\n```\n<<<D>>>",
