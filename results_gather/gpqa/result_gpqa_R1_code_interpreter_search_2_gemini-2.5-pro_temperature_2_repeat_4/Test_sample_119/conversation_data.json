    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between key variables:**\n    *   **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Parallax and Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/d`. Therefore, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of stars in a given volume:**\n    *   The number of stars (`N`) within a certain volume (`V`) is given by `N = ρ * V`.\n    *   Let's consider the total number of stars up to a distance `d`. This corresponds to the volume of a sphere with radius `d`.\n    *   The volume of a sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   So, the cumulative number of stars up to distance `d` is `N(d) = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Find the number of stars in a thin spherical shell:**\n    *   We are interested in the \"number of stars per unit range,\" which implies a differential quantity. Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell, `dV`, is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of *parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`), not per unit range of distance (`dN/dd`).\n    *   We need to change the variables in our `dN` equation from distance (`d`, `dd`) to parallax (`plx`, `d(plx)`).\n    *   We already know `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Now let's find the relationship between the infinitesimals `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars within a certain range (a magnitude), we can ignore the negative sign. So, `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN` from step 3:\n        `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * [ (1/plx²) * d(plx) ]`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is `dN / d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n        `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax (`~ 1/plx⁴`).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1/plx^1\nB) ~ 1/plx^3\nC) ~ 1/plx^4\nD) ~ 1/plx^2\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
