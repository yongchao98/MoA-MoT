    "This problem is governed by the energy-time uncertainty principle, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time states that it is impossible to know both the exact energy of a quantum state and its exact lifetime simultaneously. The relationship is given by:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state (also known as the energy width or linewidth).\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\n2.  **Interpret the Problem:** A state with a finite lifetime (Δt) does not have a perfectly sharp energy level. Instead, its energy is \"smeared\" or \"broadened\" over a range ΔE. To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two different energy levels, the separation between them (let's call it δE = |E1 - E2|) must be greater than their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime will have a larger energy width (ΔE), making it the limiting factor for resolution.\n\n3.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1, Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2, Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck Constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Width (ΔE) for Each State:** We can approximate the minimum uncertainty using the formula ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n    *   **State 1:** This state has the shorter lifetime, so it will have the larger, more significant energy width.\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / Δt₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **State 2:**\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / Δt₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Apply the Resolution Condition:** To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them, δE, must be significantly larger than the widths of the levels. Critically, it must be larger than the width of the broader level (ΔE₁).\n    *   Required condition: δE > ΔE₁\n    *   Therefore, the energy difference must be > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n    Only option D provides an energy separation that is sufficiently large to ensure the two broadened energy levels do not significantly overlap and can be clearly distinguished.\n\nHere is the calculation performed using a Python script for verification.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ndelta_t1 = 1e-9\ndelta_t2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using Delta_E ~ hbar / Delta_t\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / delta_t1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / delta_t2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"\\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the larger width, ΔE1.\")\nprint(f\"So, the energy difference must be > {delta_E1:.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-4\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > delta_E1:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (the energy width of the state), Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nA quantum state with a finite lifetime does not have a single, perfectly defined energy. Instead, its energy is \"smeared\" out over a range ΔE.\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy width for each state:** We can find the minimum energy width for each state using ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n    *   For the first state: Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   For the second state: Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n2.  **Determine the condition for resolution:** To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish between two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than their individual energy widths. Since the first state has a shorter lifetime, it has a *larger* energy width (ΔE₁), and this is the limiting factor. The energy difference between the two levels must be significantly larger than this broader width.\n\n    Required condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy separation large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as it is several orders of magnitude larger than the energy width of the broader state.\n\n<<<D>>>"
