    "*   **1. Identify the system and the potential:**\n    The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This system can be treated as three independent 1D harmonic oscillators, one for each Cartesian coordinate (x, y, z).\n\n*   **2. Recall the energy eigenvalues:**\n    The energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\n    We can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\n*   **3. Determine the energy levels:**\n    *   **Ground State (lowest energy):** $n=0$. $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n*   **4. Calculate the degeneracy:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\n    We can list the combinations (and their permutations):\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3, 0, 0). The permutations are (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, another is 1, and the last is 0: (2, 1, 0). The permutations are (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1). There is only one permutation. This gives 1 state.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of the states from all combinations: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n*   **5. Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
