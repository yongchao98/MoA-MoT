    "*   **Analysis of the context:** The conversation is between two synthetic organic chemists. A key part of synthetic chemistry is not just making new compounds, but also purifying them from starting materials, byproducts, and solvents.\n*   **Analysis of the phrase:** \"My compounds are on top of each other\" is a common piece of lab jargon. It refers to a situation where two or more substances cannot be separated using a particular technique. The phrase strongly implies a visual representation where the signals or locations of the different compounds overlap.\n*   **Evaluation of the purification techniques:** The most common purification technique in a synthetic organic chemistry lab is **chromatography**, particularly Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) for analysis and Column Chromatography for purification.\n    *   In chromatography, compounds are separated based on their differential interaction with a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents). This interaction is primarily governed by the **polarity** of the compounds.\n    *   When visualizing the separation on a TLC plate, different compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights. If two compounds have very **similar polarities**, they will travel at the same rate, and their spots will appear at the same height, i.e., \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   Similarly, in column chromatography, compounds of similar polarity will move through the column as overlapping bands, making it impossible to collect one compound without it being contaminated by the other.\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n    *   **A) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property measured by a polarimeter. It is not a separation technique itself, and you don't visually see compounds \"on top of each other\" in this context.\n    *   **B) Similar polarities:** As explained above, this directly leads to a failure in chromatographic separation, the most common purification method. The visual result on a TLC plate is spots that are \"on top of each other.\" This is the most likely meaning.\n    *   **C) Non-covalent interactions:** While these interactions are the fundamental reason for the properties that allow for separation (like polarity and boiling point), it's not the direct problem being described. The problem is the *consequence* of these interactions (similar polarity), not the interactions themselves.\n    *   **D) Similar boiling points:** This would make separation by **distillation** difficult. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of the spots seen in chromatography than the process of distillation. Chromatography is more universally applied for purification in modern synthetic labs than distillation, especially for the types of solid compounds commonly made. Therefore, the chromatographic interpretation is much more probable.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The chemist is almost certainly referring to a failed chromatographic separation, which occurs when the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
