    "The user wants me to identify an immunological process based on a described experiment.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the experimental setup and observations:**\n*   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n*   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This means the antigen is introduced to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n*   **Observation 1:** Antigen is tracked via GFP fluorescence. It reaches the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut.\n*   **Observation 2:** In the Peyer's patches, a \"proliferating cell population\" is found. This indicates an active immune response, likely a germinal center reaction where lymphocytes (B and T cells) are rapidly dividing upon recognizing the antigen.\n*   **Observation 3:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these proliferating cells is sequenced.\n*   **Key finding:** The sequenced genes show \"high variability.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the question:** The core of the question is: \"What process causes high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* encountering an antigen?\"\n\n**3. Evaluate the options in the context of the key finding:**\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the primary diversity of B cell receptors (antibodies). It occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. It assembles the variable region from V (Variable), D (Diversity), and J (Joining) gene segments. While it creates variability, it's a one-time event for each B cell during its initial development, not a process that happens in proliferating cells after antigen stimulation in a Peyer's patch.\n\n*   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA). This alters the antibody's effector function but does *not* change the variable region, which is responsible for binding the antigen. The question explicitly states the variability is in the \"variable heavy chain gene.\" Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs specifically in activated B cells that are proliferating in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations into the genes encoding the variable regions of both the heavy and light chains. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. Cells with mutations that increase affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and proliferate further (a process called affinity maturation). This directly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of the \"proliferating cell population.\" This is a perfect match for the scenario described.\n\n*   **D) Complement activation:** This is part of the innate immune system (and can be linked to the adaptive system). It involves a cascade of proteins that help clear pathogens. It has nothing to do with generating genetic diversity in the variable genes of antibodies.\n\n**Conclusion:** The process described—the generation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene within a proliferating B cell population in a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure—is the definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
