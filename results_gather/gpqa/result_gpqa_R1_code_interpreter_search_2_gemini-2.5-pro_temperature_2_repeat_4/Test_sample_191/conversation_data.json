    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charge Distribution:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. Its net charge is zero.\n    *   A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.\n    *   **Induction on the Inner Surface:** This charge $+q$ will attract negative charges within the conductor. As a result, a charge of $-q$ gets induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if we consider a Gaussian surface within the bulk of the conductor enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero everywhere on this surface (since it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the electric flux to be zero, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Therefore, the charge on the inner wall of the cavity must be $-q$ to cancel the $+q$ charge placed inside.\n    *   **Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor as a whole was initially neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall neutrality. This $+q$ charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding (The Faraday Cage Effect):**\n    *   A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields the region outside the shell from the electric fields of any charges located inside the shell.\n    *   In our case, the spherical conductor acts as a shield. The electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is determined *only* by the charge distribution on the *outer surface* of the conductor. The specific location of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity, the location of the cavity itself (given by $s$), and the distribution of the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface have no direct effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n3.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   We have established that there is a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   How is this charge distributed? Charges on the surface of a conductor will arrange themselves to make the surface an equipotential. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no *external* electric fields to influence it (the charges inside the cavity are shielded), the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field (Shell Theorem):**\n    *   The Shell Theorem in electrostatics states that the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field produced by a single point charge, with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Our situation now is simple: we have a total charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly on a spherical shell of radius $R$.\n    *   The electric field at a point P at a distance $L$ from the center of this sphere is equivalent to the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.\n    *   The formula for the magnitude of the electric field from a point charge is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|charge|}{distance^2}$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge creating the external field is $+q$.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is $L$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are irrelevant to the field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect. They are included to test the understanding of this fundamental concept. The correct expression depends only on the total charge ($q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
