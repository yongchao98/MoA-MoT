    "The user wants to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy with a specific electronic transition energy in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n**1. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy ($⟨H⟩$)**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic coupling (Zeeman effect) of the orbital angular momentum with an external magnetic field is given by:\n$H = - \\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = - \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe magnetic field is given as parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The interaction term becomes:\n$H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z$\nwhere $L_z$ is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum operator.\n\nThe expectation value of the energy, $⟨H⟩$, for an atomic state with orbital magnetic quantum number $m$ is:\n$⟨H⟩ = \\langle \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z \\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} \\langle L_z \\rangle$\nThe eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar$, so:\n$⟨H⟩ = m \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is known as the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\n$⟨H⟩ = m \\mu_B B$\n\nWe are given:\n-   A small value for the orbital magnetic quantum number, $m$. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can assume $m=1$.\n-   A magnetic field strength $B=1 \\text{ T}$.\n\nWe can now calculate the value of $⟨H⟩$. The value of the Bohr magneton is:\n$\\mu_B = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$\n\n$⟨H⟩ = (1) \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\n**2. Calculate the transition energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the energy of a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The formula relating energy and wavelength is:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given:\n-   Wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n-   Planck's constant, $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$\n-   The speed of light, $c = 3.0 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\n**3. Compare the orders of magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n-   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $⟨H⟩ \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n-   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$\\frac{⟨H⟩}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nSince the ratio is much less than 1, we can conclude that the paramagnetic coupling energy is significantly smaller than the transition energy.\n$⟨H⟩ \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis is a general result in atomic physics: the energy level shifts due to external magnetic fields (like the Zeeman effect) are typically much smaller than the energy differences between principal electronic levels (like the Balmer series transitions in Hydrogen). The given wavelength of $0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$ corresponds to the H-beta transition (n=4 to n=2) in the Hydrogen atom's Balmer series.\n\nThe comparison shows that the energy associated with the paramagnetic coupling is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of the electronic transition.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
