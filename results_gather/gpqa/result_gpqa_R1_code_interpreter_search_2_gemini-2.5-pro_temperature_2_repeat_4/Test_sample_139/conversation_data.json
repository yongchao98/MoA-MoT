    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance X and related compounds by decoding the clues.**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.**\n    *   This suggests a compound containing isotopes like Deuterium (D), Tritium (T), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, ¹⁸O, etc.\n\n*   **Clue 2, 3, 4 & 5: The Reaction**\n    *   Substance **X** reacts violently with liquid **Y**.\n    *   A gas **W** is released. W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n        *   Let's analyze potential gases:\n            *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n            *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). This is a perfect match.**\n            *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible, but D₂ fits the \"heavy isotope\" theme better.\n            *   ²⁸SiH₄: 18 protons, 18 neutrons.\n        *   The release of D₂ gas strongly suggests that Substance X is a deuteride (contains D) and/or liquid Y contains deuterium.\n    *   A precipitate **G** is formed.\n    *   When G is heated, it releases substance **B**. The melting point of **B** is very close to 277 K (which is 3.85 °C).\n        *   Water (H₂O) melts at 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   **Heavy water (D₂O) melts at 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is extremely close to 277 K.**\n        *   This strongly implies **B is D₂O**.\n    *   If heating G releases D₂O, G is likely a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)x) or a hydrated salt containing D₂O, which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. The fact that it's a precipitate suggests a low-solubility metal deuteroxide.\n    *   Now let's assemble the reaction. For B to be D₂O, the reaction environment must contain D₂O. Therefore, liquid **Y** is likely **D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: **X + D₂O(l) → D₂(g) + G(precipitate)**.\n    *   This is characteristic of a reactive metal hydride/deuteride reacting with water. For instance, `MH + H₂O → MOH + H₂`. So, `MDₓ + D₂O → M(OD)ₓ + D₂`.\n\n*   **Clue 6 & 7: The Organic Chemistry Context**\n    *   **Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.**\n    *   **The reaction of a keto acid (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH, which has 3 oxygen atoms) with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms.** This indicates a powerful reduction that removes an oxygen atom.\n    *   Strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) are famous for this. LiAlH₄ can reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Reduction of a keto acid R-C(=O)-COOH with LiAlH₄ results in a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. This product has **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This confirms X is a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. This makes Substance X, which contains a heavy isotope (Deuterium), **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verify the complete reaction with X = LiAlD₄.**\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Liquid Y:** D₂O\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n*   **Gas W:** D₂ (equal protons and neutrons). *Matches.*\n*   **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide is a precipitate). *Matches.*\n*   **Heating G:** 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O.\n*   **Substance B:** D₂O (melting point ~277 K). *Matches.*\n*   All clues are consistent with **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n**3. Calculate the required value.**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (by atomic number).\n*   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (by atomic number and mass).\n*   The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all...must be summed\" directs us to account for the stoichiometry of these specific elements in the formula.\n\nWe will use integer mass numbers as the answer choices are integers.\n*   Mass number of the specific isotope of Hydrogen present (Deuterium, D, or ²H) = 2.\n*   Mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n\n*   **Contribution from the lightest element (Hydrogen):**\n    *   There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D).\n    *   Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n\n*   **Contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminium):**\n    *   There is 1 atom of Aluminium (Al).\n    *   Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Sum = (Total mass from lightest element) + (Total mass from heaviest element)\n    *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
