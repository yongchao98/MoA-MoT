    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Energy Conservation**\n    In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$. This total energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$ and the kinetic energy $T = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n\n    For a conservative force like the spring force $F = -kx$, the work done by the force is equal to the negative change in potential energy, $W = -\\Delta U$. The potential energy of a spring is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n    The work-energy theorem states that the work done on the particle equals the change in its kinetic energy: $W = \\Delta T$.\n    Combining these, we get $\\Delta T = -\\Delta U$, which implies $\\Delta T + \\Delta U = 0$, or $\\Delta(T+U) = 0$.\n    Therefore, the quantity $E_{conserved} = T + U = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ is conserved throughout the motion.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Displacement (Amplitude)**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, $x = A$, the mass momentarily comes to rest.\n    *   The velocity is $v = 0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is $T = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total conserved mechanical energy is $E_{conserved} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n3.  **Energy at the Equilibrium Position**\n    At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero, and the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The velocity is $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $T = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   The potential energy is $U = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The total conserved mechanical energy is $E_{conserved} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Equating Energies to Find v_max**\n    Since energy is conserved, we can equate the energy at the maximum displacement to the energy at the equilibrium position:\n    $E_{conserved}(x=A) = E_{conserved}(x=0)$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for $\\gamma_{max}$**\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max} - 1$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$**\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ back into the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    The derived expression for the maximum speed $v_{max}$ matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
