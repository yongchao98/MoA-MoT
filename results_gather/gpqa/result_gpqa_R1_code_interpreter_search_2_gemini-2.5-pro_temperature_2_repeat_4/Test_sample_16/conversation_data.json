    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and reaction.**\n    The problem involves the calcium-EDTA complex, denoted as [CaY]²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ is the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand). This complex is in a solution and will dissociate to some extent into its constituent ions, Ca²⁺ and Y⁴⁻.\n    The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    The equilibrium is:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Understand the equilibrium constant.**\n    The problem provides the formation constant (also known as the stability constant), K_f or K_Ca-EDTA, for the reaction:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    For the dissociation reaction ([CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻), we need the dissociation constant, K_d. The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms when the complex dissociates. Since the stoichiometry of the dissociation is 1:1:1, the concentration of Y⁴⁻ formed will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [CaY]²⁻ complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\n| Species         | [CaY]²⁻        | Ca²⁺ | Y⁴⁻  |\n|-----------------|----------------|------|------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M         | 0 M  | 0 M  |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x             | +x   | +x   |\n| **Equil. (E)**  | 0.02 - x       | x    | x    |\n\n    The term \"ideal pH\" implies that we can use the given absolute formation constant and don't need to account for the protonation of EDTA, which would create a conditional formation constant.\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x.**\n    The expression for the dissociation constant, K_d, is:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Simplify and calculate.**\n    Because the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small. This means that the complex dissociates very little, and 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n    Now, solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\n    x² = (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² = 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated concentration matches option B.\n\n    A) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    D) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\n<<<B>>>"
