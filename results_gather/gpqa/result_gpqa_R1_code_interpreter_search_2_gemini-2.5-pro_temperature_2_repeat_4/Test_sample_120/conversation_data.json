    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Structure:** The name describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The `bicyclo[4.1.0]` nomenclature indicates a 6-membered ring and a 3-membered ring sharing a side. `7-oxa` means atom 7 is an oxygen, which forms the bridge between bridgehead carbons C1 and C6. This is a cyclohexane epoxide.\n*   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations are given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We must determine the 3D structure from this information. We will represent the structure using a planar hexagon with wedged (up) and dashed (down) bonds. Through careful application of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules, we can establish the orientation of each group.\n    *   Let's assume the bulky epoxide ring is pointing **up** (wedged).\n    *   **At C1 (1R):** The groups are O, C6, C2, and Me. Priorities: O > C6 > C2 > Me. To achieve (R) with the epoxide up, the methyl group must also be **up** (wedged).\n    *   **At C6 (6S):** The groups are O, C1, C5, and H. Priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H. To achieve (S) with the epoxide up, the hydrogen must be **down** (dashed).\n    *   **At C3 (3R):** The groups are C2, C4, Me, and H. Priorities: C2 > C4 > Me > H. To achieve (R), the methyl group must be **up** (wedged).\n    *   **At C4 (4R):** The groups are C3, C5, Me, and H. Priorities: C3 > C5 > Me > H. To achieve (R), the methyl group must be **down** (dashed).\n\n    So, the relative stereochemistry of the starting material is:\n    *   Epoxide: UP\n    *   C1-Me: UP\n    *   C3-Me: UP\n    *   C4-Me: DOWN\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Organocuprates react with epoxides via an SN2-type mechanism. The problem states two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  The attack causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n### 3. Determine the Site of Attack\nThe epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6. We must compare their steric hindrance.\n*   **C1** is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a methyl group.\n*   **C6** is a secondary carbon, substituted only with a hydrogen atom.\n\nClearly, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and it will be the site of nucleophilic attack.\n\n### 4. Predict the Product's Structure\n1.  **Attack:** The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6. Since the epoxide is **up**, the attack must occur from the opposite side, which is the **down** side. This is an anti-attack.\n2.  **Inversion at C6:** The configuration at C6 inverts. The original H atom was **down**, so it will be pushed **up**. The incoming new methyl group will be **down**.\n3.  **Ring Opening:** The C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond remains, and after workup with a proton source (like water or mild acid), the oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the original C1-O bond was pointing **up**, the resulting -OH group will also be pointing **up**.\n4.  **Other Stereocenters:** The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations are retained.\n\n**Summary of the Product's Stereochemistry (relative up/down):**\n*   At C1: -OH group is UP, original methyl group is UP.\n*   At C6: new methyl group is DOWN, H atom is UP.\n*   At C3: methyl group is UP.\n*   At C4: methyl group is DOWN.\n\n### 5. Name the Product and Determine its Absolute Configuration\nFirst, let's find the IUPAC name. The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   The carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. This was the original C1.\n*   We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The methyls are at what were originally C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n    *   Clockwise numbering: C1(OH, Me), C2(new Me), C3(H), C4(Me), C5(Me), C6(H). This gives the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Locants are {1,2,4,5}.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering gives 1,3,4,6-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. Locants are {1,3,4,6}.\n*   The set {1,2,4,5} is lower than {1,3,4,6}, so the correct name is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and B.\n\nNow we determine the absolute configuration (R/S) for the chiral centers (C1, C2, C4, C5) in the product.\n*   **New C1 (Old C1):** Groups: -OH (up), -Me (up). Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. Configuration is **(R)**.\n*   **New C4 (Old C4):** Groups: -Me (down). Priority of side chains C3 > C5. Configuration is **(R)**.\n*   **New C5 (Old C3):** Groups: -Me (up). Priority of side chains C4 > C6. Configuration is **(R)**.\n*   **New C2 (Old C6):** This is the key center. We found that the H is UP (wedged) and the new Me group is DOWN (dashed).\n    *   Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    *   To determine the configuration, we look down the C2-H bond (the lowest priority group). Since the H atom is UP (wedged/in front), we trace the path of the other three groups (C1 → C3 → Me) and reverse the result.\n    *   This path traces a clockwise (CW) circle.\n    *   Reversing the result gives an **(S)** configuration.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### Conclusion\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur deduced product matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
