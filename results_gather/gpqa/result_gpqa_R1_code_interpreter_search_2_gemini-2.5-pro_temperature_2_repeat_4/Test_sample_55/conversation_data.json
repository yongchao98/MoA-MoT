    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem asks for the route and probability of a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> (or 3s state) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> (or 1s state).\n\n    The selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n\n2.  **Determine the First Step of the Transition**\n    *   Initial state: |3, 0, 0>. Here, l_initial = 0.\n    *   According to the selection rule Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have l_intermediate = 1.\n    *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number `n` must decrease. The most common intermediate state is n=2.\n    *   Thus, the intermediate state is of the form |2, 1, m_intermediate>.\n    *   For the magnetic quantum number `m`, the initial state has m_initial = 0.\n    *   Applying the Δm = 0, ±1 rule, the intermediate magnetic quantum number, m_intermediate, can be m_initial + Δm = 0 + {0, ±1} = {0, ±1}.\n    *   So, there are three possible intermediate states: |2, 1, -1>, |2, 1, 0>, and |2, 1, 1>. These correspond to the three degenerate 2p orbitals.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Step of the Transition**\n    *   Intermediate state: |2, 1, m_intermediate>\n    *   Final state: |1, 0, 0>\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for this step.\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m_intermediate. This can be 0, +1, or -1, depending on whether m_intermediate is 0, -1, or +1, respectively. This is also allowed.\n    *   So, all three pathways through the intermediate states |2, 1, -1>, |2, 1, 0>, and |2, 1, 1> are allowed by the E1 selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Branching Ratios (Probabilities)**\n\n    *   **Step 1: |3, 0, 0> → |2, 1, m_intermediate>**\n        The transition probability (rate) from an initial state |i> to a final state |f> is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, |<f|**d**|i>|^2, where **d**=e**r** is the electric dipole operator. For spontaneous emission, we average over all emission directions and polarizations.\n\n        The initial state |3,0,0> (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. The interaction Hamiltonian for spontaneous emission is also isotropic. Because of this rotational symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the atom to transition into. Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning into any of the degenerate final states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> must be equal.\n\n        Since these are the only possible E1 decay channels from the 3s state (direct decay to 1s or 2s is forbidden as Δl=0), the total probability sums to 1. As there are three equally probable channels, the probability (or branching ratio) for transitioning into any specific one of them is 1/3.\n\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\n    *   **Step 2: |2, 1, m_intermediate> → |1, 0, 0>**\n        From any of the 2p states (|2, 1, m_intermediate>), the only energetically allowed E1 decay is to the 1s ground state (|1,0,0>). Any other transitions are forbidden or extremely unlikely. Therefore, once the atom is in the 2p state, it will decay to the 1s state with a probability of 1.\n\n        P(|2, 1, m_intermediate> → |1, 0, 0>) = 1\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Probability for the Cascade Route**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific two-step transition route. The total probability of a sequence of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\n    Let's evaluate the probability for the route specified in option C:\n    Path: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n\n    Total Probability = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)\n    Total Probability = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n    Let's check the options based on our result.\n    A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4} (Incorrect probability, should be 1/3)\n    B) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3} (Incorrect probability)\n    C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3} (Correct route and probability)\n    D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4} (Incorrect probability, should be 1/3)\n\n    The only option that matches our calculation is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
