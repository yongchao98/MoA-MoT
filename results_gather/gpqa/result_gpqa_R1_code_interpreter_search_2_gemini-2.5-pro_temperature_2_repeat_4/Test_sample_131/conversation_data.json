    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information Provided in the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The compounds in the mixture have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** It is a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four given options based on its molecular structure and symmetry. The key is to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent protons and the splitting pattern for each signal. Since all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets, we are looking for methyl (CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons.\n\n*   **Compound 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula Check:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical (D2h point group). It has multiple planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 3 and 6. Due to symmetry, they are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are four methyl groups. Due to symmetry, all four are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **Compound 2: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula Check:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry (C2v point group) that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 5 and 6. The plane of symmetry makes them chemically equivalent. Since they are equivalent, they appear as a single signal. Although they are adjacent (ortho), they are chemically equivalent (an AA' system), which typically results in a single, potentially complex, peak. For a simplified case like this problem, it is treated as a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent by symmetry. This gives one **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent by symmetry. This gives a second **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (each 6H, so in a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Compound 3: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula Check:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a single plane of symmetry (Cs point group) that passes through the C2 and C5 atoms and their attached methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are reflections of each other across the plane and are therefore chemically equivalent. This will give one **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by reflection. They produce one **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 lies on the plane of symmetry, so it is unique. It gives one **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 also lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a different environment from the one at C2. It gives another **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Compound 4: 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula Check:** C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical (D2h point group).\n    *   **1H NMR:** The spectrum would show a singlet for the aromatic protons (4H), a **quartet** for the CH2 protons (4H), and a **triplet** for the CH3 protons (6H). The presence of a quartet and triplet does not match the problem's description of only singlet signals in the aliphatic region. Thus, this compound is not in the mixture.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combinations (The Options)**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (1, 2, and 3) produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Mixture Spectrum:** 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and 3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. Together, this produces **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   This combination is a perfect fit for the described spectrum.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Both compounds give a 2H singlet. This would combine to give two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part matches.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combination would have up to five singlets. To obtain three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, significant and specific overlaps would be required, which is unlikely and inconsistent with the data presented. For example, the signals would be (6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which cannot be combined to form a 2:1:1 ratio (which would correspond to 12H:6H:6H). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Both compounds give a 2H singlet, leading to two singlets in a 1:1 ratio in the mixture. This part matches.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would show up to four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This is not three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. This option is incorrect (unless you assume the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally overlap, which is a less direct explanation than that for option A).\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce a quartet and a triplet, which are not observed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that directly and simply explains the observed NMR data is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
