    "Answering this question involves comparing the total masses of two binary star systems using the principles of orbital mechanics applied to spectroscopic binaries.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars (K1 and K2). The relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law and is given by the mass function for such systems:\n\nM_total * sin³(i) = [P / (2 * π * G)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n\n### **2. Use the Eclipsing Information**\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". This is a critical piece of information. For an eclipse to occur, our line of sight must lie very close to the orbital plane. This means the inclination `i` must be approximately 90°.\n\nIf `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nThe mass equation simplifies to:\n\nM_total ≈ [P / (2 * π * G)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nThis shows that the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K_total)³\n\n### **3. Calculate for Each System**\n\nWe can now apply this relationship to the data provided for each system.\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Velocity amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s, 5 km/s\n*   Total velocity amplitude (K1_total) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Velocity amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s, 10 km/s\n*   Total velocity amplitude (K2_total) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n### **4. Determine the Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n\n(M_total_1) / (M_total_2) = [P1 * (K1_total)³] / [P2 * (K2_total)³]\n\nThe constant of proportionality cancels out, so we can use the given values directly (as long as units are consistent, which they are: years for period, km/s for velocity).\n\n(M_total_1) / (M_total_2) = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n\n### **5. Final Calculation**\nLet's compute the value of this ratio.\n```python\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_total = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_total = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio M1/M2, which is proportional to P * K_total^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_total**3)) / (P2 * (K2_total**3))\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n>>>0.432\n\nThe result of the calculation is 0.432. This value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires us to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M₁/M₂).\n\n**1. Relevant Physics Principles**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m₁ + m₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K₁ and K₂) by the following formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\n(m₁ + m₂) * sin³(i) = [P / (2πG)] * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nwhere:\n*   `M_total` = m₁ + m₂ is the total mass of the system.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes.\n\n**2. The Significance of \"Eclipses\"**\n\nThe problem states that both are eclipsing binary systems. For eclipses to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n\n*   If i ≈ 90°, then sin(i) ≈ 1.\n*   Therefore, sin³(i) ≈ 1.\n\nThis significantly simplifies the mass equation to:\n\nM_total ≈ [P / (2πG)] * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nThis tells us that the total mass is proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K_total)³\n\n**3. Setting up the Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2. Using the proportionality above:\n\n(M_total_1) / (M_total_2) = [P₁ * (K_total_1)³] / [P₂ * (K_total_2)³]\n\n**4. Plugging in the Given Values**\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   P₁ = 2 years\n    *   K_total_1 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   P₂ = 1 year\n    *   K_total_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nLet's substitute these values into the ratio equation.\n\n(M_total_1) / (M_total_2) = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script gives:\n\n(M_total_1) / (M_total_2) = 0.432\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is approximately 0.432. This value is closest to the 0.4 listed in option D. This means system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2 (i.e., it is less massive).\n\n<<<D>>>"
