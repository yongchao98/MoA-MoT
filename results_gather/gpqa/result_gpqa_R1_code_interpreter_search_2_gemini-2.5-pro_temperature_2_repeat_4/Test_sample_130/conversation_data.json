    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is described as a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene\". This is **maleic acid**.\n    *   This acid is dehydrated to its corresponding anhydride. The dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the given NMR data for this anhydride:\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons (on the C=C double bond) chemically equivalent. This leads to a single peak (a singlet), which is consistent with the \"single peak at 7 ppm\" described.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** Due to symmetry, there are only two types of carbon atoms: the two equivalent vinyl carbons and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This leads to two peaks, consistent with the \"two peaks at 137 ppm (C=C) and 165 ppm (C=O)\" described.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is the diene for the reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n    *   The **endo rule** states that for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions (which is the usual case unless run at high temperatures for long times), the *endo* isomer is the **major product**. The *exo* isomer is the **minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the adduct is calculated by adding the formulas of the reactants:\n        *   Maleic anhydride: C₄H₂O₃\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: C₉H₁₄ (C₅H₂ core + 4 x CH₃)\n        *   Product: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products and their Protons:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry in both the endo and exo products that bisects the anhydride ring and the C=C double bond.\n    *   Let's identify the different types of protons in the products:\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (Ha):** Two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule. They are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups, so they will be deshielded. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the signal for these protons.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls:** Two methyl groups are attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system. They are equivalent by symmetry. Their protons will be somewhat deshielded by the double bond. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to these protons.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions. They are equivalent by symmetry. These are attached to saturated carbons and should be the most shielded methyl groups. The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** corresponds to these protons.\n        *   **C7-Bridge Protons:** The CH₂ group from the original cyclopentadiene becomes the C7 methylene bridge of the bicyclic system. These two protons are diastereotopic (one points towards the double bond, *syn*, and one points away, *anti*) and will likely appear as two separate signals, each being a doublet due to coupling to each other. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** must be one of these C7-bridge protons.\n\n4.  **Use NOESY to Differentiate Endo and Exo Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** (the *endo* isomer) but **absent (or weak) in the minor product** (the *exo* isomer). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n    *   Let's visualize the two isomers:\n        *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond, on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7 methylene bridge. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (**Ha**) are close in space to the *anti*-proton on the C7 bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between **Ha** and the **C7-bridge proton**.\n        *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points \"away\" from the C7 methylene bridge. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (**Ha**) are very far from the C7-bridge protons. No NOE cross-peak is expected between them. Instead, the **Ha** protons are now close to the **vinylic methyl groups**, and an NOE would be expected there.\n\n5.  **Identify the Correct Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product is the one between the anhydride protons (**Ha**) and one of the C7-bridge protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments:\n        *   Anhydride protons (**Ha**) = **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n        *   C7-bridge proton = **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the resonance at ~1.5 ppm with the resonance at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: (Bridgehead Me and Vinylic Me) - Incorrect, too far apart.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: (Vinylic Me and Ha) - Incorrect, this cross-peak would be strong in the *minor* (exo) product, not the major one.\n    *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: (C7-bridge H and Ha) - Correct, this proximity exists only in the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: (Bridgehead Me and C7-bridge H) - Incorrect, this proximity exists in both isomers, so it's not a differentiating peak.\n\nThe correct answer is the pair of resonances corresponding to the C7-bridge proton and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
