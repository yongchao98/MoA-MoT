    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also show this peak, its significant broadness is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the absorption region for a carbonyl (C=O) group. The combination of a broad O-H peak and a C=O peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is a very strong indication of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of a C=C bond, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment ion for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the loss of the alkyl chain, leaving the [COOH]⁺ fragment. The mass of this fragment is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45) strongly points to the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates the formulas C6H12O and C6H10O, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.\n    *   Both the FTIR (1650 cm⁻¹) and 1H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) data confirm the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the molecule.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to Differentiate:**\n    The degree of unsaturation (or number of double bond equivalents) tells us the total number of rings and/or π-bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DBE = C + 1 - H/2.\n\n    *   Our identified functional groups are: one C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond. This means the molecule must have a DBE of at least 2.\n\n    *   **Calculate DBE for C6H10O2:**\n        DBE = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        This DBE of 2 perfectly matches our findings: one C=O bond (1 DBE) + one C=C bond (1 DBE).\n\n    *   **Calculate DBE for C6H12O2:**\n        DBE = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        A DBE of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C double bond that was clearly identified by two different techniques.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe molecular formula must be C6H10O2 because it is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms (for the carboxylic acid) and has a degree of unsaturation of 2 (accounting for both the carbonyl C=O and the alkene C=C).\n\n<<<B>>>"
