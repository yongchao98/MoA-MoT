    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3. The partition function is defined as the sum over all possible microstates of the system, weighted by their Boltzmann factor.\n\nThe formula for the partition function Z is:\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-E_state / kT) = Σ_states * e^(-β * E_state)\nwhere β = 1/(kT), and the sum is over all possible states of the system.\n\nThe system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each spin can take one of two values: +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2^3 = 8 possible microstates for the system.\n\nThe energy of the system for a given state is given by the formula:\nE = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states and then sum their corresponding Boltzmann factors.\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states (S1, S2, S3) and compute the energy for each:\n\n1.  **State (+1, +1, +1):**\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    The Boltzmann factor is e^(-β * (-3J)) = e^(3Jβ)\n\n2.  **State (+1, +1, -1):**\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    The Boltzmann factor is e^(-β * J) = e^(-Jβ)\n\n3.  **State (+1, -1, +1):**\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    The Boltzmann factor is e^(-Jβ)\n\n4.  **State (-1, +1, +1):**\n    E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    The Boltzmann factor is e^(-Jβ)\n\n5.  **State (+1, -1, -1):**\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    The Boltzmann factor is e^(-Jβ)\n\n6.  **State (-1, +1, -1):**\n    E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    The Boltzmann factor is e^(-Jβ)\n\n7.  **State (-1, -1, +1):**\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    The Boltzmann factor is e^(-Jβ)\n\n8.  **State (-1, -1, -1):**\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    The Boltzmann factor is e^(-β * (-3J)) = e^(3Jβ)\n\nNow, we can group the states by their energy levels to calculate the partition function Z.\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E1 = -3J):**\n    This energy level corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The number of states (degeneracy) is g1 = 2.\n    The contribution to Z from this level is 2 * e^(3Jβ).\n\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E2 = J):**\n    This energy level corresponds to the other six states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    The number of states (degeneracy) is g2 = 6.\n    The contribution to Z from this level is 6 * e^(-Jβ).\n\nThe total partition function Z is the sum of the contributions from all energy levels:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z = 2e^(2J\\beta) + 6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z = 6e^(2J\\beta) + 2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z = 2e^(-3J\\beta) + 6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z = 2e^(3J\\beta) + 6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
