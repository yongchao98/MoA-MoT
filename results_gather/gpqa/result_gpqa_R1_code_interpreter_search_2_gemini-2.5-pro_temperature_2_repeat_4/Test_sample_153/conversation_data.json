    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%)).\n    *   So, we are looking for a molecule with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl) and containing one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   There is a very broad absorption peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically > 10 ppm) that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton. Its acidity and rapid exchange with any trace water mean it does not couple with other protons, hence it appears as a singlet.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We have a total of 4 aromatic protons. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n\n*   **Putting It All Together & Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   From the IR and NMR, we know the compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option A (Phenyl chloroformate, an ester/acid halide) and option B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde).\n    *   We are left with 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Both are carboxylic acids and both have a molecular formula of C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrum.\n    *   The deciding factor is the ¹H NMR aromatic splitting pattern.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** (ortho-substituted) has four distinct aromatic protons, which would result in a complex pattern of multiplets, not two simple doublets.\n        *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** (para-substituted) has the exact symmetry required to produce two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded (further downfield, at 8.02 ppm), and the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be slightly less deshielded (at 7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** All three pieces of spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) are fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\n# Molecular weight calculation for the options to confirm the MS data.\n# We will use the most common isotopes: C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35\n\n# A) Phenyl chloroformate: C7H5ClO2\nmw_a = 7*12 + 5*1 + 35*1 + 2*16\n# B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: C7H5ClO2\nmw_b = 7*12 + 5*1 + 35*1 + 2*16\n# C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: C7H5ClO2\nmw_c = 7*12 + 5*1 + 35*1 + 2*16\n# D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: C7H5ClO2\nmw_d = 7*12 + 5*1 + 35*1 + 2*16\n\nprint(f\"Molecular weight of C7H5(35)ClO2 is: {mw_c}\")\n\n# All four proposed structures have the same molecular formula (C7H5ClO2)\n# and therefore the same molecular weight, which matches the M+ peak at m/z = 156.\n# The M+2 peak for the 37Cl isotope would be 156 - 35 + 37 = 158.\n# This confirms the molecular formula is correct. The choice must be made on IR and NMR data.\n```\n>>>\nMolecular weight of C7H5(35)ClO2 is: 156\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires integrating information from three different types of spectroscopy (Mass Spectrometry, Infrared, and NMR) and evaluating the given choices.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 gives the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotope of each element.\n    *   The presence of a second peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32% is highly significant. The intensity ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl is about 75% and 25% (a 3:1 ratio).\n    *   This confirms the compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. My code execution confirms that the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ has a weight of 156, which is the formula for options B, C, and D.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad absorption peak stretching from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic textbook signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules causes this significant broadening.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The IR data strongly suggests the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option A (Phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester/acid halide) and option B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde/phenol).\n\n3.  **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm** is a singlet integrating to one proton (1H). A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of the highly acidic proton of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region consist of two doublets: one at **8.02 ppm** (2H) and another at **7.72 ppm** (2H). This pattern indicates a total of four aromatic protons that are in two different chemical environments. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint for a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para arrangement means there are only two unique types of protons on the ring.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Remaining Options:**\n    *   We are left with 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is an *ortho* (1,2) disubstituted ring. All four protons on the ring would be in unique chemical environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (likely four distinct multiplets), not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a *para* (1,4) disubstituted ring. Due to the plane of symmetry through the two substituent groups, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the chlorine are equivalent. This symmetry produces exactly the observed pattern of two doublets. The protons next to the -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:** All three pieces of spectral data point unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
