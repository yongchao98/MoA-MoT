    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule given by the condensed formula: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\nLet's draw out the full structure to count the atoms and bonds correctly.\nThe formula represents the following connections:\n*   A carbon atom double-bonded to another carbon, with two methyl (CH3) groups attached: `(CH3)2C=`\n*   This is connected to a `CH` group: `=CH-`\n*   This is connected to a `CH2` group: `-CH2-`\n*   This is connected to a `CH` group which has a methyl group attached: `-CH(CH3)-`\n*   This is connected to another `CH2` group: `-CH2-`\n*   This is connected to another `CH` group: `-CH=`\n*   This is connected to a carbon atom with two methyl groups attached: `=C(CH3)2`\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CH3                           CH3\n      |                             |\nH3C - C = C - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n          |         |               |\n          H         CH3             CH3\n```\nNow, let's count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):** There are 8 carbons in the main chain and 4 methyl groups, plus the carbon in the -CH(CH3)- group's methyl. Let's count them all: 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (from C=) + 1 (from =CH) + 1 (from CH2) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from the CH3 on CH) + 1 (from the next CH2) + 1 (from the next CH=) + 1 (from C=) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):** 2*3 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (from CH) + 2 (from CH2) + 1 (from CH) + 3 (from the CH3 on CH) + 2 (from the next CH2) + 1 (from the next CH=) + 2*3 (from (CH3)2) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nFrom the structure, we can count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** Each of the 5 methyl groups has 3 C-H bonds (5 * 3 = 15). The chain has two `=CH-` groups (2 * 1 = 2), two `-CH2-` groups (2 * 2 = 4), and one `-CH(CH3)-` group (1 * 1 = 1). Total C-H bonds = 15 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 22 bonds. This matches the number of hydrogen atoms.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure: `(CH3)2C=CH-` and `-CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds:**\n    *   2 bonds from the first `C` to its two `CH3` groups.\n    *   1 bond between `C=CH` and `CH2`.\n    *   1 bond between `CH2` and `CH(CH3)`.\n    *   1 bond between `CH(CH3)` and its `CH3` group.\n    *   1 bond between `CH(CH3)` and the next `CH2`.\n    *   1 bond between `CH2` and the next `CH=`.\n    *   2 bonds from the last `C` to its two `CH3` groups.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9 bonds.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   22 C-H bonds\n*   9 C-C bonds\n*   2 C=C bonds\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms.\nΔH_atomization (C12H22) = (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C)\n\nUsing the given bond energies:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization (C12H22) = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_atomization (C12H22) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of gaseous carbon and 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen).\n\nΔH_atomization (reactants) = (12 × ΔH_atomization(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n\nUsing the given data:\n*   ΔH_atomization(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization (reactants) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_atomization (reactants) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n### **5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form atoms from reactants and the energy released when these atoms form the product.\nΔHf = ΔH_atomization (reactants) - ΔH_atomization (compound)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **6. Convert to the Required Units (kJ/g)**\n\nThe options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g and see if it matches any option.\nFirst, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n\nNow, convert ΔHf to kJ/g:\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the arithmetic.\n```python\n# Number of C and H atoms\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Bond Counts\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_eq_C_bonds = 2\n\n# Given Data (kJ/mol)\nBE_C_H = 400\nBE_C_C = 200\nBE_C_eq_C = 300\nBE_H_H = 100\ndH_atom_C = 1000\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of the compound (product)\ndH_atom_product = (num_C_H_bonds * BE_C_H) + (num_C_C_bonds * BE_C_C) + (num_C_eq_C_bonds * BE_C_eq_C)\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of reactants\n# Reactants are 12 C(s) and 11 H2(g)\ndH_atom_reactants = (num_C * dH_atom_C) + ((num_H / 2) * BE_H_H)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndH_f_mol = dH_atom_reactants - dH_atom_product\n\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (using integer atomic weights as is common in such problems)\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g\ndH_f_g = dH_f_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization of C12H22: {dH_atom_product} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization of reactants: {dH_atom_reactants} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {dH_f_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass of C12H22: {molar_mass} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {dH_f_g} kJ/g\")\n\n```\n>>>\nEnthalpy of atomization of C12H22: 11200 kJ/mol\nEnthalpy of atomization of reactants: 13100.0 kJ/mol\nEnthalpy of formation: 1900.0 kJ/mol\nMolar Mass of C12H22: 166 g/mol\nEnthalpy of formation: 11.44578313253012 kJ/g\n\nThe result 11.4457... kJ/g rounds to 11.44 kJ/g. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The step-by-step reasoning and calculations are as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count:**\n    *   The chemical name provided is `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n        *   Carbons (C): 2 (from `(CH3)2`) + 1 (from `C=`) + 1 (from `=CH-`) + 1 (from `-CH2-`) + 1 (from `-CH(CH3)-`) + 1 (from the methyl on `CH`) + 1 (from `-CH2-`) + 1 (from `-CH=`) + 1 (from `=C`) + 2 (from `(CH3)2`) = 12 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 6 (from `(CH3)2`) + 1 (from `CH`) + 2 (from `CH2`) + 1 (from `CH`) + 3 (from the methyl on `CH`) + 2 (from `CH2`) + 1 (from `CH`) + 6 (from `(CH3)2`) = 22 hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n    *   Now, we count the number of each type of bond from the expanded structure:\n        *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 C-H bonds.\n        *   **C-C single bonds:** 9 bonds.\n        *   **C=C double bonds:** 2 bonds.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Molecule (ΔH_atom_product):**\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous molecule into gaseous atoms.\n    ΔH_atom_product = (Number of C-H bonds × BE_C-H) + (Number of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (Number of C=C bonds × BE_C=C)\n    ΔH_atom_product = (22 × 400 kJ/mol) + (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol)\n    ΔH_atom_product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n    This value corresponds to option D, but it is the enthalpy of atomization, not the enthalpy of formation.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants (ΔH_atom_reactants):**\n    The formation reaction is: `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)`.\n    The reactants must first be converted to gaseous atoms.\n    *   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n    *   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 (breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n    ΔH_atom_reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ/mol**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf):**\n    The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. It can be calculated using the following relationship based on Hess's Law:\n    ΔHf = (Enthalpy to atomize reactants) - (Enthalpy to atomize the product molecule)\n    ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n5.  **Check the Options and Convert Units:**\n    The options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g.\n    *   Our calculated value in kJ/mol is 1900 kJ/mol. Option A gives this value but in incorrect units (kJ/g).\n    *   Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check option C.\n    *   First, find the molar mass of C12H22. Using atomic masses C=12 g/mol and H=1 g/mol (as is standard for such problems):\n        Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n    *   Now, convert ΔHf to kJ/g:\n        ΔHf (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
