    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, let's call them fragment 1 and fragment 2, with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. These fragments are moving, carrying kinetic energy.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragments' masses:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n2.  The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nLet's work with the rest-mass energies, which is more convenient.\n*   `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n*   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`\n\nFrom the given initial rest-mass energy, `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`, we have:\n`m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow we can solve the system of two equations:\n1.  Substitute `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2` into the sum equation:\n    `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n2.  Now find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (fragment 1) is `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and for the lighter one (fragment 2) is `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) comes from the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared by the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, where `T1` is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and `T2` is that of the lighter one.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest, so the total initial momentum was zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n*   `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`. Therefore, `p^2 = 2mT`.\nUsing the momentum conservation condition `p1^2 = p2^2`:\n*   `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n*   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have:\n*   `(2 * m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n*   `2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nNow we solve this along with the energy conservation equation `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`:\n*   `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\nSo, the value of T1 calculated using the classical approximation is 1 GeV, or 1000 MeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the Correct T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and rest-mass is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`, so `E = T + m*c^2`.\nWe can rearrange the energy-momentum relation to solve for momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nSubstituting `E = T + m*c^2`:\n*   `(pc)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2`\n*   `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2`\n*   `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m*c^2)`\n\nNow, apply the momentum conservation condition `p1^2 = p2^2` (or `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`):\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have the following values:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n*   `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`\n\nSubstitute these into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * 198 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * 99`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n\nNow, solve for `T1`:\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct (relativistic) value of T1 is 1.005 GeV, or 1005 MeV.\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = (Correct T1) - (Classical T1)\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nTo match the options, we convert this to Mega-electron-volts (MeV):\n*   `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<A>>>"
