    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following 1H NMR signals:\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** A chemical shift around 2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** A singlet means these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal strongly indicates the presence of an acetate group, `CH₃-C(=O)-O-`. All four options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents another methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is typical for an allylic methyl group, which is a methyl group attached directly to a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C-CH₃`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** A doublet means this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (`-CH-`). According to the n+1 rule, one neighbor proton splits the signal into 1+1 = 2 peaks (a doublet).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This indicates a `CH₃-CH=` fragment.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The very downfield shift (high ppm) suggests this proton is on a carbon atom adjacent to an electronegative atom, like the oxygen of the acetate group (`-O-CH=`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other adjacent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is critical for determining stereochemistry. Vicinal coupling constants across a double bond are:\n        *   **¹²J_trans ≈ 12-18 Hz**\n        *   **¹²J_cis ≈ 6-12 Hz**\n    *   **Conclusion:** A J-value of 16.0 Hz definitively indicates a **trans** relationship between this proton and its coupling partner.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region. This is the other proton on the double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** part arises from coupling to the single vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** part arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons (an adjacent methyl group, CH₃). According to the n+1 rule, 3 neighbor protons split the signal into 3+1 = 4 peaks (a quartet).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This proton is on a double bond, is adjacent to another vinylic proton, and is also adjacent to a methyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`).\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n\nLet's combine the information from the signals:\n*   We have an acetate group: `CH₃-C(=O)-O-`. (from signal at 2.1 ppm)\n*   We have a `CH₃-CH=` fragment. (from signals at 1.6 ppm and 5.5 ppm)\n*   We have a second `CH=` proton on the same double bond. (from signal at 7.0 ppm)\n*   The two protons on the double bond are `trans` to each other. (from J = 16.0 Hz)\n*   The proton at 7.0 ppm is attached to the oxygen of the acetate group due to its significant downfield shift.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the following structure:\n`CH₃(s, 2.1) - C(=O) - O - CH(d, 7.0) = CH(dq, 5.5) - CH₃(d, 1.6)`\nThe double bond has a `trans` configuration.\n\n**3. Compare the Deduced Structure with the Options**\n\n*   **A) Trans-butenyl acetate & B) Cis-butenyl acetate:** A \"butenyl\" group has four carbon atoms (e.g., `-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃`). Our deduced structure has a three-carbon `propenyl` group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). A butenyl acetate would also show signals for an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), which are not present in the data. So, options A and B are incorrect.\n\n*   **C) Cis-propenyl acetate:** This molecule has the correct connectivity (`CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃`), but the `cis` geometry would result in a small coupling constant (J ≈ 6-12 Hz) for the vinylic protons. The observed J-value is 16.0 Hz. So, option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This molecule has the correct connectivity and the `trans` geometry. The trans configuration explains the large coupling constant of J = 16.0 Hz. The predicted signals for this structure perfectly match the experimental data provided.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate based on the chemical shifts, integration, splitting patterns, and particularly the large vinylic coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), which is characteristic of a trans double bond.\n\n<<<D>>>"
