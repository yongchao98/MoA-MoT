    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Defining Observability Criteria for Both Observatories\n\nTo be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, a star must meet the criteria of both instruments simultaneously.\n\n**a) Apparent Magnitude (V)**\n\n*   ESPRESSO limit: `V < 17` mag\n*   HIRES limit: `V < 16` mag\n*   For a star to be observable by *both*, it must be brighter than the stricter limit. Therefore, the combined magnitude requirement is **`V < 16.0` mag**.\n\n**b) Declination (DEC)**\n\n*   An object's visibility in the sky depends on its declination and the latitude of the observatory.\n*   Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. A star must have a declination `DEC < +65.4°` to rise above its horizon.\n*   Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately +19.8°. A star must have a declination `DEC > -70.2°` to rise above its horizon.\n*   For a star to be visible from *both* observatories, its declination must be within the overlapping range. The problem statement says to disregard pointing limits and altitudes, so we only consider whether the star rises at all. Thus, the combined declination requirement is approximately **`-70° < DEC < +65°`**.\n\n### 2. Evaluating Each Star\n\nNow we check each star against these two combined criteria: `V < 16.0` and `-70° < DEC < +65°`. We will calculate the apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) for each star where it is not directly provided using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d_pc) - 5 + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d_pc` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the extinction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_star(star_name, dec, v_mag, m_v=None, dist_pc=None, e_b_v=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a star is observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n    \n    Args:\n        star_name (str): The name of the star.\n        dec (float): Declination in degrees.\n        v_mag (float): Apparent V magnitude (if known).\n        m_v (float): Absolute V magnitude.\n        dist_pc (float): Distance in parsecs.\n        e_b_v (float): Color excess E(B-V).\n    \n    Returns:\n        None.

Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **Star 1:** Fails the declination criterion.\n*   **Star 2:** Fails the magnitude criterion.\n*   **Star 3:** Passes both criteria (DEC = 48°, V = 15.5 mag).\n*   **Star 4:** Fails the magnitude criterion (V = 16.74 mag).\n*   **Star 5:** Passes both criteria (DEC = 60°, V ≈ 15.0 mag).\n\nThe stars that can be detected by both instruments are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To be observable by both spectrographs, a star must satisfy the visibility conditions for both observatories.\n\n**1. Establish Observability Criteria**\n\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):**\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with `V < 17 mag`.\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with `V < 16 mag`.\n    *   To be seen by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter condition: **`V < 16.0 mag`**.\n\n*   **Declination (DEC):**\n    *   Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ -24.6°). It can observe objects north of declination `-90° + (-24.6°) = -65.4°`. However, practically speaking for good observations, it is stated that `DEC < +65°` for it.\n    *   Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ +19.8°). It can observe objects south of declination `+90° - (19.8°) = +70.2°`, however, practically speaking `DEC > -70°` for it.\n    *   For a star to be observable from **both**, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **`-70° < DEC < +65°`**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Star**\n\nWe need to check the apparent magnitude (V) and declination (DEC) for each star against these criteria. We use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) if it's not given: `m_V = M_V - 5 + 5*log10(d) + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the visual extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   DEC = -75°. This is outside the observable range (`-70° < DEC < +65°`).\n    *   *Result: Not observable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   V = 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the required `V < 16.0 mag`.\n    *   *Result: Not observable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   DEC = 48°. This is within the observable range.\n    *   The apparent V magnitude is given as `V = 15.5 mag`. This is brighter than `16.0 mag`. (Note: The provided extinction is not needed to calculate apparent magnitude here, as it's already given).\n    *   *Result: Observable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   DEC = -48°. This is within the observable range.\n    *   Calculate apparent magnitude: `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag`.\n    *   `m_V = 15.5 - 5 + 5*log10(10) + 1.24 = 15.5 - 5 + 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag`.\n    *   `V = 16.74 mag`, which is fainter than `16.0 mag`.\n    *   *Result: Not observable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   DEC = 60°. This is within the observable range.\n    *   Calculate apparent magnitude (no extinction mentioned, so `A_V = 0`):\n    *   `m_V = 16.5 - 5 + 5*log10(5) = 11.5 + 5 * 0.699 = 11.5 + 3.495 = 14.995 mag`.\n    *   `V ≈ 15.0 mag`, which is brighter than `16.0 mag`.\n    *   *Result: Observable by both.*\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the declination and magnitude criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<C>>>"
