    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of constitutional isomerism where two isomers, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a hydrogen atom (proton) from an alpha-carbon (a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen, along with a shift of a double bond. A key requirement for this is the presence of at least one hydrogen on an sp3-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds. The full name is cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are the ones involved in the C=C double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogens are attached to these sp2-hybridized carbons. Standard keto-enol tautomerism requires a proton on an sp3-hybridized alpha-carbon. Removing a hydrogen from an sp2 carbon (a vinylic hydrogen) is significantly more difficult and does not typically happen in a simple tautomeric equilibrium.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While benzoquinone can be reduced to hydroquinone (an aromatic phenol), this is a redox reaction (gain of two electrons and two protons), not a simple tautomerization equilibrium. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH2 groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are sp3 hybridized and each carries two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can easily lose these acidic alpha-protons to form enols. In fact, it undergoes tautomerization at all three positions to form its enol tautomer, benzene-1,3,5-triol (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and thus highly stable compound. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows extensive tautomerism**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n        *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        *   Group 3: -CH3 (methyl group)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH3 (ester group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar around the double bond. It contains no chiral centers (no carbon atom is attached to four different groups). Furthermore, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
