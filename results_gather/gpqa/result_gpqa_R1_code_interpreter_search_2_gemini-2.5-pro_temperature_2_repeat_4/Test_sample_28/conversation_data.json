    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that will most severely disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. A complete loss of function is the desired outcome. This is most reliably achieved by a mutation that results in a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein sequence. The process of converting the DNA sequence into a protein is called translation, and it reads the DNA in groups of three bases, called codons. We need to compare the original (intact) sequence to each mutant sequence.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\n*   **ATG** is the start codon, coding for Methionine (M).\n*   **TTT** codes for Phenylalanine (F).\n*   **CTC** codes for Leucine (L).\n*   **GCT** codes for Alanine (A).\n*   and so on...\n\nThe original protein sequence starts as: **Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...**\n\nNow let's examine each mutant:\n\n1.  **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...\n    *   **Original:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT...` (M, F, L, A...)\n    *   **Mutant:** `ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   Let's translate the mutant codons:\n        *   ATG -> Methionine (M) (Same)\n        *   TTC -> Phenylalanine (F) (Same as TTT, a silent mutation)\n        *   TAC -> Tyrosine (Y) (Different from Leucine)\n    *   The resulting protein sequence starts: **Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala...**\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not guaranteed to eliminate the compound.\n\n2.  **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...\n    *   **Original:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT...` (M, F, L, A...)\n    *   **Mutant:** `ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   Let's translate the mutant codons:\n        *   ATG -> Methionine (M)\n        *   TTC -> Phenylalanine (F)\n        *   **TAA** -> **STOP**\n    *   The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to halt prematurely.\n    *   The resulting \"protein\" would only be two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A severely truncated protein like this, stopped at the very beginning of its sequence, is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n3.  **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...\n    *   **Original:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (M, F, L, A, G, T...)\n    *   **Mutant:** `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   Here, two codons are changed:\n        *   CTC (Leucine) becomes TAC (Tyrosine).\n        *   ACT (Threonine) becomes GTC (Valine).\n    *   This introduces two **missense mutations**. While changing two amino acids has a higher chance of disrupting function than changing one, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n4.  **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...\n    *   **Original:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   **Mutant:** `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   Comparing the full strings shows that the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   This is a combination of a missense mutation (Leucine to Tyrosine) and an in-frame deletion of one amino acid (Glycine). Since a full codon (3 bases) was deleted, the reading frame is not shifted. The protein will be shorter by one amino acid and have another one changed. This is likely to be disruptive, but not as certain to cause complete loss of function as the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective way to \"knock out\" a gene is to introduce a nonsense mutation that creates a premature stop codon, especially near the beginning of the gene. This leads to a severely truncated and non-functional protein. **Mutant 2** is the only one with a nonsense mutation (`TAA`). Therefore, it is the most probable candidate to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
