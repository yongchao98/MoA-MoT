    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\nLet Y be the element with atomic mass M_Y, and F be fluorine with atomic mass M_F ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\nThe substance A2 is a binary fluoride of Y, with a general formula YF_n.\nThe mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given as 31.96%.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n\nRearranging to solve for M_Y:\n0.3196 * (M_Y + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n0.3196 * M_Y + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n0.3196 * M_Y = 12.9276n\nM_Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\nM_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe need to find an element Y and a plausible integer oxidation state `n` that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for `n`:\n*   If n=1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to K, Ca). These don't form the variety of fluorides described.\n*   If n=2, M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Br, Se). We check the mass percentages for their common fluorides, but none match. For example, for BrF3, ɷF = 41.6%; for BrF5, ɷF = 54.3%.\n*   If n=3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol. Let's test this. If Y=Sb, A2 would be SbF3.\n    Let's calculate the theoretical ɷF for SbF3:\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is an excellent match with the given 31.96%.\n*   If n=4, M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol. No common element matches well.\n*   If n=5, M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol.\n*   If n=6, M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Plutonium (Pu), M≈244 g/mol. If Y=Pu, A2 would be PuF6.\n    Let's calculate ɷF for PuF6 (using M_Pu=244):\n    M(PuF6) = 244 + 6 * 19 = 358 g/mol.\n    ɷF(PuF6) = (6 * 19) / 358 = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 or 31.84%. This is also an excellent match.\n\nSo, the two primary candidates for Y are Antimony (Sb) and Plutonium (Pu).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the candidates using the other clues.**\nWe have several chemical clues:\n- A1 is a bright-red substance.\n- A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine. (A1 -> A2 + F2)\n- A1 and A3 can oxidize/interact with xenon (Xe).\n- The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` occurs with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants.\n\n**Let's analyze the Plutonium (Pu) hypothesis:**\n- Y = Pu, A2 = PuF6.\n- **Xe reactivity**: PuF6 (our A2) is a very strong oxidizing agent and is known to react with Xe. The problem states A1 and A3 react with Xe. If A1 is a precursor to PuF6, and A3 is also a Pu fluoride, this is consistent. PuF6 itself could be A3 (formed by fluorination of Pu).\n- **Reaction stoichiometry**: The reaction is `Pu + A4 -> A5` (1:1 ratio). This is a comproportionation. If A4 is PuF6 and A5 is PuF3, the balanced reaction is `Pu + PuF6 -> 2PuF3`. The molar ratio of the reactants Pu and PuF6 is 1:1. This is a perfect match with the problem statement. So, A4=PuF6.\n- **Contradictions**: The molecular weight of A4=PuF6 is ~358 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges. This is a major issue. Also, the identity of the \"bright-red\" A1 that decomposes to PuF6 + F2 is not a commonly known substance.\n\n**Let's analyze the Antimony (Sb) hypothesis:**\n- Y = Sb, A2 = SbF3.\n- **A1 decomposition**: The reaction is `A1 -> A2 + F2`, which means `A1 -> SbF3 + F2`. This is a reduction reaction, so A1 must be a higher fluoride, which would be SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid, not a \"bright-red substance\". This is a direct contradiction.\n- **Xe reactivity**: SbF5 can react with Xe, but it typically requires energy like UV light, so \"under normal conditions\" is debatable.\n- **Reaction stoichiometry**: The reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5`. To get a common fluoride, the reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3`. This would mean A4=SbF5 and A5=SbF3. However, the required molar ratio of reactants (Sb : SbF5) is 2:3, not 1:1. This contradicts the problem statement.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve inconsistencies and determine A4.**\nThe Plutonium hypothesis provides a much more coherent story, fitting the stoichiometry and reactivity clues well. Its only flaw is that the calculated molecular weight of A4 (358 g/mol) is not among the options.\nThe Antimony hypothesis has multiple, significant contradictions with the clues (color, reactivity, stoichiometry).\n\nThis suggests there may be a flaw in the problem statement, specifically in the provided answer options. However, we are forced to choose the best possible answer from the given list. Let's reconsider the Sb case, assuming the contradictions are inaccuracies in the problem statement. If we ignore the 1:1 ratio and assume the standard comproportionation, then A4 = SbF5.\nLet's calculate the molecular weight of A4 = SbF5.\nMW(SbF5) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nThis value, 216.76 g/mol, is not within any range. It is, however, close to range C.\nC) 220-240\n\nLet's check if there is an alternative interpretation. Could A4 be something else? What if A4 is a complex acid formed in solution, like fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF6)? Its molecular weight is 1.01 + 121.76 + 6*19.00 = 236.77 g/mol. This value falls squarely in range C) 220-240.\nLet's see if this fits.\n- Is HSbF6 a \"binary compound of fluorine with element Y\"? No, it contains hydrogen. This is a contradiction.\n- Does it produce a \"colorless concentrated solution\"? Yes, this is a very strong possibility.\n- Does it react with Sb metal? `Sb + HSbF6 -> ...` A reaction is plausible.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, the most likely intended answer path involves a substance whose molecular weight fits one of the ranges. The scenario where A4 = HSbF6 results in a molecular weight of ~237 g/mol, fitting range C. This requires us to interpret \"binary compound\" loosely, but it resolves the molecular weight problem which is the final question. Other hypotheses either lead to MWs outside all ranges (Pu) or MWs that are also outside the ranges and have numerous other contradictions (Sb). The HSbF6 possibility, while contradicting the \"binary\" definition, fits the MW range perfectly. It seems the problem author considered fluoroantimonic acid as a possibility for A4.\n\nTherefore, we choose the path that leads to a valid molecular weight range.\n\n1.  Element Y is Antimony (Sb).\n2.  A2 is SbF3, based on the excellent mass percentage match.\n3.  The \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" refers to fluoroantimonic acid, A4 = HSbF6. Although not a binary compound, it's a well-known, extremely strong acid formed from SbF5 and HF.\n4.  The molecular weight of A4 = HSbF6 is M = 1.01(H) + 121.76(Sb) + 6 * 19.00(F) = 236.77 g/mol.\n5.  This molecular weight falls into the range **220-240**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
