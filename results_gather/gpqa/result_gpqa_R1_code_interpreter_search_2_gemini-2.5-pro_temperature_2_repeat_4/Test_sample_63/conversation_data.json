    "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Results**\n\n*   **Heating:** An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B (total mass = 7.20 g), is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a lime water test. It absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, no such acidic gases were present in the mixture. Basic gases like ammonia (NH₃) would also be absorbed, so NH₃ is also not present.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and will react with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP). It did not react in any of the tubes, suggesting it's a non-acidic, non-basic, non-oxidizing, and non-water-soluble gas. Nitrogen (N₂) is the most likely candidate.\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of Products**\n\n*   **Moles of Water (H₂O):**\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   n(H₂O) = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen Atoms in Tube №3:**\n    *   The mass increase is the mass of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   n(O) = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Gas C (N₂):**\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   n(Gas C) = volume / molar volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**3. Identify the Gaseous Mixture**\n\nThe initial gas mixture from the decomposition contains H₂O, the final gas C (N₂), and an oxidizing gas that provided the 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n\n*   The oxidizing gas must be neutral (passed through tube #2 unchanged). Common neutral oxidizing gases from salt decomposition are oxygen (O₂) and nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n*   Let's test the hypothesis that the oxidizing gas is **N₂O**. The reaction with hot copper is: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂.\n    *   According to the stoichiometry, 1 mole of N₂O produces 1 mole of CuO, meaning it provides 1 mole of O atoms. Thus, `n(N₂O) = n(O) = 0.05 mol`.\n    *   This reaction also produces 1 mole of N₂ gas for every mole of N₂O reacted. So, `n(N₂ produced) = n(N₂O) = 0.05 mol`.\n    *   The final gas C (N₂) is the sum of any N₂ that was initially present in the gas mixture *plus* the N₂ produced in tube #3.\n    *   Total N₂ (Gas C) = Initial N₂ + N₂ from N₂O reaction\n    *   0.1 mol = Initial N₂ + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, **Initial N₂ = 0.05 mol**.\n\n*   This fits perfectly. The original mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was:\n    *   **0.2 mol H₂O**\n    *   **0.05 mol N₂O**\n    *   **0.05 mol N₂**\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are looking for two salts, A and B, in an equimolar ratio that decompose to produce the gas mixture above. The products contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen, which points towards ammonium salts with oxygen-containing anions.\n\nConsider the thermal decomposition of:\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture contains `x` mol of NH₄NO₃ and `x` mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   From NH₄NO₃, we would get `x` mol of N₂O and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n*   From NH₄NO₂, we would get `x` mol of N₂ and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n\nComparing this to our calculated product amounts:\n*   n(N₂O) = `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   n(N₂) = `x` = 0.05 mol\n\nThis is perfectly consistent, as `x` has the same value in both cases, confirming the mixture is equimolar with 0.05 mol of each salt.\n\nNow let's check the amount of water produced:\n*   Total H₂O = `2x` + `2x` = `4x` = 4 * (0.05 mol) = 0.2 mol.\n*   This matches our calculation from the mass increase in tube №1.\n\nFinally, let's verify the total initial mass of the salt mixture:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4(1)+14+3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4(1)+14+2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.20 g.\n*   This matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\nThe identification of salts A and B as **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
