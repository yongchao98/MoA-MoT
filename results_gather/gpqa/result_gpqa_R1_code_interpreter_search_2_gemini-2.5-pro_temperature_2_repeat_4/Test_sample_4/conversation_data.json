    "The user wants to find the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along a direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n\n1.  **Define the Operator Components:**\n    The components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ are given in terms of $2 \\times 2$ matrices.\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    Here, $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices, and $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$. A muon is a spin-1/2 particle.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector lying in the x-z plane. We can parameterize this vector using the standard spherical coordinate system. A vector in the x-z plane has an azimuthal angle $\\phi = 0$. Let $\\theta$ be the polar angle, which is the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis.\n    The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is given by:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$\n    With $\\phi=0$, this becomes:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n    So, $n_x = \\sin\\theta$, $n_y = 0$, and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x (\\sin\\theta) + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y (0) + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z (\\cos\\theta)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Substituting the matrices for $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components:**\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    From equation (1), we can solve for the ratio of $b$ to $a$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Now, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The unnormalized eigenvector is of the form:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    To normalize the eigenvector, its squared norm must be equal to 1: $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n    Let's rewrite the eigenvector in a more convenient form by choosing $a = C \\cos(\\theta/2)$ for some constant $C$.\n    Then $b = C \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = C \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    So, $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The normalization condition is:\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\left( C^* \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) & \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = |C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $\\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x = 1$, we get:\n    $|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$.\n    By convention, we choose the overall phase to be zero, so we take $C=1$.\n\n    The normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
