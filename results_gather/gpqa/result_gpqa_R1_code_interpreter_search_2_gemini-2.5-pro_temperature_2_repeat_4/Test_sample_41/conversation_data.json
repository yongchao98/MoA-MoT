    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = [L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d^2)]^(1/4)`\nwhere:\n*   `L` is the star's luminosity.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   `d` is the orbital distance from the star.\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star, `L` and `σ` are constant. The problem states that the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets. Therefore, all terms are constant except for `d`. The relationship simplifies to:\n`T_eq` is proportional to `(1 / d^2)^(1/4)`, which means `T_eq ∝ 1 / d^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(d)`.\n\nFrom this proportionality, we can derive the relationship between the orbital distances of two planets and their equilibrium temperatures:\n`(T_eq_i / T_eq_j) = sqrt(d_j / d_i)`\nSquaring both sides gives:\n`(T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2 = d_j / d_i`\n\n**2. Understand the Relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`). For the circular orbits mentioned in the problem, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance (`d`).\n`P^2 ∝ d^3`\nThis means the ratio of periods and distances for any two planets (`i` and `j`) is:\n`(P_i / P_j)^2 = (d_i / d_j)^3`\n\n**3. Combine the Relationships to Connect Period and Temperature**\n\nWe want to find the ratio of orbital periods (`P3 / P1`) using the given temperature ratios. We need to find a direct relationship between `P` and `T_eq`.\n\nFrom step 1, we have: `d_j / d_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2`. Let's re-arrange this for `d_i / d_j`:\n`d_i / d_j = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^2`\n\nNow, substitute this into the equation from Kepler's Third Law (step 2):\n`(P_i / P_j)^2 = ((T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^2)^3`\n`(P_i / P_j)^2 = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^6`\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n`P_i / P_j = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^3`\n\nWe want to find `P3 / P1`. Using the formula above (with `i=3` and `j=1`):\n`P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3`\n\n**4. Calculate the Required Temperature Ratio**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n*   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n\nTo find `T_eq1 / T_eq3`, we multiply these two ratios:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Orbital Period Ratio**\n\nNow we can calculate the final answer. The following Python code performs the calculation.\n*   First, it calculates the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3`.\n*   Then, it calculates the period ratio `P3 / P1` by cubing the temperature ratio.\n\nThe planet mass ratios and the specific albedo value are not needed for the calculation, as they are either negligible (masses, in the standard application of Kepler's Law) or constant for all planets (albedo).\n\n```python\n# Given temperature ratios\nT_ratio_12 = 1.4  # T_eq1 / T_eq2\nT_ratio_23 = 2.3  # T_eq2 / T_eq3\n\n# We derived the relationship P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet3\n# T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\nT_ratio_13 = T_ratio_12 * T_ratio_23\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1\nP_ratio_31 = T_ratio_13 ** 3\n\nprint(P_ratio_31)\n```\n\nThe output of this code will give us the final answer.\n> 실행 결과:\n> ```\n> 33.386248000000004\n> ```\nThe calculated value is approximately 33.386. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nThe result `33.386` is closest to `33.4`.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For planets orbiting the same star, the equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is primarily dependent on the orbital distance (`d`).\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its orbital distance (`d`).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Relationship between Temperature and Distance:**\n    *   The equilibrium temperature formula is `T_eq = [L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d^2)]^(1/4)`, where `L` is the star's luminosity, `A` is the albedo, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   Since the planets orbit the same star (`L` is constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), the relationship simplifies to: `T_eq` is proportional to `(1/d^2)^(1/4)`, which is `d^(-1/2)`.\n    *   Therefore, `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(d)`.\n    *   This proportionality implies that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures for two planets (Planet `i` and Planet `j`) is related to the ratio of their orbital distances as:\n        `T_i / T_j = sqrt(d_j / d_i)`\n    *   Squaring both sides gives us a direct relationship for the distance ratio:\n        `d_j / d_i = (T_i / T_j)^2`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Relationship between Period and Distance:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance: `P^2 ∝ d^3`.\n    *   For two planets (`i` and `j`), the ratio is:\n        `(P_i / P_j)^2 = (d_i / d_j)^3`\n\n4.  **Combine the Relationships to Connect Period and Temperature:**\n    *   Our goal is to find the period ratio (`P3 / P1`) from the temperature ratios. We need to eliminate the distance variable (`d`) from our equations.\n    *   From Step 2, we have `d_i / d_j = (T_j / T_i)^2`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `(d_i / d_j)` into the Kepler's Law equation from Step 3:\n        `(P_i / P_j)^2 = [ (T_j / T_i)^2 ]^3 = (T_j / T_i)^6`\n    *   Taking the square root of both sides gives a direct relationship between period and temperature:\n        `P_i / P_j = (T_j / T_i)^3`\n    *   Let's apply this to find `P3 / P1` (so `i=3` and `j=1`):\n        `P3 / P1 = (T1 / T3)^3`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Ratios:**\n    *   The problem gives us:\n        *   `T1 / T2 = 1.4`\n        *   `T2 / T3 = 2.3`\n    *   The mass ratios and the specific albedo value are irrelevant information because the albedo is constant for all planets and Kepler's Third Law (in this simplified form) doesn't depend on the planet's mass (as long as the planets' masses are much smaller than the star's mass, which is a standard assumption).\n    *   First, we need to calculate the temperature ratio `T1 / T3`:\n        `T1 / T3 = (T1 / T2) * (T2 / T3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n    *   Now, we can calculate the period ratio `P3 / P1`:\n        `P3 / P1 = (T1 / T3)^3 = (3.22)^3`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   Using the provided Python code block, the calculation is performed.\n        *   `T_ratio_13 = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n        *   `P_ratio_31 = (3.22)^3 ≈ 33.386`\n    *   The result `33.386` is closest to the value `33.4` in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
