    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The given potential is in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n    $V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n    Solving the Schrödinger equation directly in polar coordinates for this potential is complicated because the potential is not separable in $r$ and $\\theta$ (due to the $\\cos^2(\\theta)$ term being multiplied by $r^2$).\n\n2.  **Change to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    A common strategy for potentials involving terms like $r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$ or $r^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)$ is to convert to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The conversion relations are:\n    *   $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n    *   $y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n    *   $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(\\theta))^2$\n    Since $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$, we can replace the second term:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Now, group the terms containing $x^2$ and $y^2$:\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} k x^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2) + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}) k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{4}{2}) k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n4.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential is now in the form $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, which is a sum of two independent potentials. This represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The motion in the x-direction is independent of the motion in the y-direction.\n    *   The potential for the x-oscillator is $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$.\n    *   The potential for the y-oscillator is $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$.\n\n5.  **Find the Oscillator Frequencies:**\n    The standard potential for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) is $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2q^2$, where $m$ is the mass and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. We can compare our potentials to this standard form to find the frequencies $\\omega_x$ and $\\omega_y$.\n\n    *   For the x-direction:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_x^2 x^2 = 2kx^2$\n        $m\\omega_x^2 = 4k$\n        $\\omega_x^2 = \\frac{4k}{m} \\implies \\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n    *   For the y-direction:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_y^2 y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n        $m\\omega_y^2 = k$\n        $\\omega_y^2 = \\frac{k}{m} \\implies \\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n6.  **Determine the Energy Spectrum:**\n    The energy of a 2D separable system is the sum of the energies of the individual 1D systems. The energy spectrum for a 1D QHO is $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n\n    The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energy eigenvalues from the x and y oscillators:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y$\n\n    Now, substitute the frequencies we found:\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right)$\n\n7.  **Final Algebraic Simplification:**\n    Factor out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n    $E = \\left[ 2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left[ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n    This result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
