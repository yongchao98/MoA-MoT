    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Frame S: The Galaxy's reference frame. We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame for the purpose of the calculation.\n    *   Frame S': The supernova ejecta's reference frame. This is the \"moving\" frame relative to the Galaxy.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Quantities:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames (v). The problem states that from the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. By the principle of relativity, the speed of the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame (S) is the same. So, v = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (S'). This is given as 50 seconds. Since this time is measured in the frame of the moving object (the ejecta), it is the \"proper time,\" denoted as Δt₀ or Δt'. So, Δt' = 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is a constant, approximately c = 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels *in the Galaxy reference frame* (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Plan:**\n    *   To find the distance `d` in the Galaxy frame (S), I need to use the formula: `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (S).\n    *   The speed `v` is already known (60,000 km/s).\n    *   The time `Δt` is unknown, but I can calculate it using the time dilation formula from special relativity, as the velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n    *   The time dilation formula relates the time in the stationary frame (Δt) to the proper time in the moving frame (Δt'): Δt = γ * Δt', where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation (Step-by-Step):**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the velocity as a fraction of c (β).**\n        β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - β²)\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²)\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\n        γ = 1 / √(0.96)\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n        Δt = γ * Δt'\n        Δt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s\n\n    *   **Step D: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d).**\n        d = v * Δt\n        d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s]\n        d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km\n        d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km\n\n6.  **Use a a Python script for precise computation.**\n    Now, I will use Python to compute the final numerical value of `d`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nv = 60000  # Speed of the ejecta in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # Proper time in the ejecta's frame in s\nc = 300000  # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the denominator for the Lorentz factor\ndenominator = math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the distance d = v * dt = v * (gamma * dt_prime)\n# This can be written as d = (v * dt_prime) / sqrt(1 - beta**2)\nnumerator = v * dt_prime\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the result\nprint(distance_in_galaxy_frame)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.178478496\n\n7.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   Looking at the options:\n        A) 2,880,000 km\n        B) 3,060,000 km\n        C) 3,000,000 km\n        D) 2,940,000 km\n    *   The calculated value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on measured distance.\n\nHere's the reasoning breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy frame\" is the stationary frame (S).\n    *   The \"ejecta frame\" is the moving frame (S').\n\n2.  **List Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the frames is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (S'), which is the proper time (Δt₀ or Δt'), is 50 seconds.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy frame (S). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n\n4.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    *   Because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time will pass differently in the two reference frames. The time measured in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time measured in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`).\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Calculation Steps:**\n    *   First, let's calculate the Lorentz factor, `γ`.\n        *   `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n        *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Next, calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame, `Δt`.\n        *   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy frame.\n        *   `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96)`\n        *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nThe code execution provides the precise result of this calculation: `3,061,862.17...` km.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2,880,000 km\nB) 3,060,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km\nD) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
