    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   Parent: Benzene ring.\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three substituents are in a meta relationship to each other.\n\n2.  **Recall the Properties of the Substituents and Reactions:**\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Introduced by Friedel-Crafts acylation (e.g., CH3COCl/AlCl3). It is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Introduced by nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). It is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Introduced by bromination (e.g., Br2/FeBr3). It is a deactivating group but an **ortho,para-director**.\n\n3.  **Identify Critical Constraints:** A crucial rule in aromatic synthesis is that **Friedel-Crafts acylation does not work on strongly deactivated rings**. This means the acetyl group cannot be added to a ring that already has a nitro group on it. This constraint allows us to quickly eliminate several options.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n        *   Step i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n        *   Step iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of an aniline derivative (product of step ii). Friedel-Crafts acylation fails on aniline because the basic amine reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst, deactivating the ring. Therefore, sequence A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n        *   Steps i-iv convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene using H3PO2. This sequence is circular and accomplishes nothing. Therefore, sequence B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n        *   Step i) Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene.\n        *   Step ii) Nitration of bromobenzene gives mainly 4-bromonitrobenzene.\n        *   Step iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of 4-bromonitrobenzene. This ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so the reaction will not proceed. Therefore, sequence D is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n        *   This sequence starts with Friedel-Crafts acylation on benzene, which is a valid reaction. Let's trace the steps:\n        *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a successful Friedel-Crafts acylation. We now have a meta-directing acetyl group on the ring.\n        *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-bromoacetophenone:** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This is the correct and expected product.\n        *   **iii) 3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** We now have two substituents: the -COCH3 group at position 1 (meta-director) and the -Br group at position 3 (ortho,para-director). The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The meta-directing influence of the acetyl group is dominant in this case, leading to the formation of the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** By the process of elimination based on fundamental reaction principles (especially the limitations of the Friedel-Crafts reaction), Option C is the only viable pathway. The first three steps of sequence C represent a logical and standard synthesis for the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are unnecessary for the synthesis and appear to be distractors, but they do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
