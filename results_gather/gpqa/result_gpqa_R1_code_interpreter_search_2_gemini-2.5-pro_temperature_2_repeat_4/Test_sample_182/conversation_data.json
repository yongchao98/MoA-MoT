    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactant molecule.**\n    The reactant is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". Let's break down this name to understand its structure.\n    *   **Parent chain:** \"cyclohex-3-ene\" indicates a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n    *   **Principal functional group:** \"carboxylic acid\" (-COOH) is at position 1.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   \"2-formyl\" indicates an aldehyde group (-CHO) at position 2.\n        *   \"5-vinyl\" indicates a vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at position 5.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the reactant.**\n    We don't strictly need the formula, but it's good practice to determine it to calculate the initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n    *   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n    *   The structure has one ring and four pi bonds (one in the cyclohexene ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the aldehyde C=O, and one in the carboxylic acid C=O).\n    *   The IHD, or degree of unsaturation, is a count of the rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   IHD of reactant = 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for C=C in ring) + 1 (for C=C in vinyl) + 1 (for C=O in acid) + 1 (for C=O in aldehyde) = 5.\n    *   This corresponds to option A, which is the IHD of the *reactant*, not the product.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the reaction conditions.**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its role is to perform exhaustive reduction of the molecule.\n    *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces (saturates) carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It does not typically break open stable rings like cyclohexane.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the structure of the product.**\n    Applying the effects of Red P + HI to the reactant:\n    *   The \"cyclohex-3-ene\" ring becomes a \"cyclohexane\" ring (the C=C bond is reduced).\n    *   The \"carboxylic acid\" group at C1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The \"formyl\" group at C2 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The \"vinyl\" group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it will be an isomer of ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane (e.g., 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane based on original numbering). The exact isomerism is not important for the IHD calculation.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The IHD can be determined directly from the structure of the product.\n    *   The product contains one ring (the cyclohexane ring). A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   All the pi bonds (C=C and C=O) from the original molecule have been reduced to single bonds. There are no pi bonds left.\n    *   Therefore, the total IHD of the final product is the sum of IHD from rings and pi bonds.\n    *   IHD (product) = 1 (from the ring) + 0 (from pi bonds) = 1.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the molecular formula. The product is a saturated cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms (the same as the reactant). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n    *   Molecular formula of the product = C10H(2*10) = C10H20.\n    *   The formula for IHD is: IHD = C - H/2 + 1 (for hydrocarbons).\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods give the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
