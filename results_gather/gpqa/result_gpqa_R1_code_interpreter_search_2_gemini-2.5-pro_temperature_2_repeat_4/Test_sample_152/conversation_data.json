These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "This problem requires analyzing three different Michael addition reactions to determine the major products for the first two and a reactant for the third.\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The α-hydrogen atoms are acidic and can be removed by a base.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The β-carbon (the one bearing the p-tolyl group) is the electrophilic site for conjugate addition.\n3.  **Identify the Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the dimethyl malonate to form a nucleophilic enolate (carbanion): `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n4.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition).\n    *   `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` + `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃` → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n5.  **Protonation:** The intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final product (A).\n    *   `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃` + EtOH → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃` + EtO⁻\n6.  **Name the Product (A):** The product structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`. This molecule has three ester groups. Let's analyze the name provided in the options: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   This name implies a propane (3-carbon) backbone.\n    *   `1,1,3-tricarboxylate` means two methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups are on C1 and one is on C3.\n    *   `2-(p-tolyl)` means a p-tolyl group is on C2.\n    *   Assembling this gives: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1)-CH(p-tolyl)(2)-CH₂(3)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This structure matches our derived product. Thus, A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, a nitrogen analog of an enolate formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are potent carbon nucleophiles at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is part of a Stork enamine synthesis.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The enamine's α-carbon attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting intermediate is an iminium salt.\n4.  **Workup:** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a ketone. The piperidine is removed, and the C=O group of the original cyclohexanone is restored.\n5.  **Structure of Product (B):** A new C-C bond forms between C2 of the cyclohexane ring and C3 of the butenenitrile (`-CH(CH₃)-`). The final product is a 2-substituted cyclohexanone. The substituent is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. The structure is `2-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexanone`.\n6.  **Name the Product (B):** We can name this compound as a derivative of butanenitrile. The main chain is `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at C3.\n    *   The substituent is `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   So, the name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This matches the keto form, which is the stable major product.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This shows a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring substituted at the C2 position.\n2.  **Retrosynthesis:** This product is the result of a Michael addition. We can disconnect the bond formed during the reaction. The bond is between C2 of the dione and the substituent chain.\n3.  **Identify the Michael Donor:** The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` fragment must have been the Michael donor. The C2 position is an \"active methylene\" group, flanked by two carbonyls, making its protons highly acidic. The base (KOH) deprotonates it to form a stable enolate. Therefore, reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n4.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor:** The other reactant given is but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. Let's see if this forms the `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain.\n    *   The enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the β-carbon (`CH₂`) of MVK.\n    *   The fragment added is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   This is the `(3-oxobutyl)` group. So the reaction is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
