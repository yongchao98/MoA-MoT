    "**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but does not differentiate the isomers.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   \"no vinyl-hydrogens\": This confirms there are no C=C double bonds, consistent with all four structures being saturated acids.\n    *   \"a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\": This is a very specific and complex splitting pattern. It implies a single proton (`CH`, let's call it Hx) is being split by three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving the doublet, `d`).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (giving the triplet, `t`).\n        *   Three neighboring protons (giving the quartet, `q`).\n        This means the Hx proton must be on a carbon that is adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n    *   \"a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\": This implies a different proton (`CH`, let's call it Hy) in the same molecule is being split by:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving the doublet, `d`).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (giving the first triplet, `t`).\n        *   Another set of two neighboring protons (giving the second triplet, `t`).\n        This means the Hy proton must be on a carbon that is adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and another, different `CH₂` group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's deduce the most likely structures from the condensed formulas and check if they possess protons that would give these specific splitting patterns. The general structure of these acids is a carbon chain with the `COOH` group at C1. Protons on one carbon are split by protons on adjacent carbons.\n\n*   **B) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-C³H(c)(CH₃(d))-C²H(e)(CH₃(f))-COOH`\n    *   Let's analyze proton H(c) on carbon C3. Its neighbors are on C4 (`CH₂`), C2 (`CH`), and the methyl group attached to C3 (`CH₃`).\n    *   Neighbors of H(c): H(b) (2H), H(e) (1H), H(d) (3H).\n    *   Splitting for H(c): triplet from H(b), doublet from H(e), quartet from H(d). This gives the **dtq** pattern. This matches one signal.\n    *   However, this molecule does not have a proton with the environment needed for a `dtt` (a CH neighbored by CH, CH₂, and another CH₂). Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-C³H(c)(C₂H₅(d))-C²H(f)(C₂H₅(g))-COOH`\n    *   Let's analyze proton H(c) on carbon C3. Its neighbors are on C4 (`CH₂`), C2 (`CH`), and the ethyl group attached to C3 (`CH₂`).\n    *   Neighbors of H(c): H(b) (2H), H(f) (1H), H(d) (2H).\n    *   Splitting for H(c): triplet from H(b), doublet from H(f), triplet from H(d). This gives the **dtt** pattern. This matches the second signal.\n    *   However, this molecule does not have a proton with the environment needed for a `dtq` (a CH neighbored by CH, CH₂, and CH₃). Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   This structure does not contain any protons that would give a `dtq` or a `dtt`. For example, the proton at C3 is adjacent to a `CH` and a `CH₂`, which would give a `dt`. The proton at C4 is adjacent to a `CH` and two `CH₃` groups, giving a doublet of septets (`d sep`). Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n    The written formula is ambiguous and likely contains typos. However, we can deduce what the correct structure must be. The correct molecule must contain **both** the fragment required for the `dtq` signal and the fragment for the `dtt` signal. Let's consider the structure **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    \n    Structure: **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n           `CH₃(a)`\n           `|`\n    `CH₃(b)CH₂(c)-C⁴H(d)-C³H(e)-C²H₂(f)-COOH`\n                            `|`\n                            `C'H₂(h)-C''H₃(i)`\n    \n    *   **Proton H(d) at C4**: This proton has three sets of neighbors on adjacent carbons.\n        *   On C5: `CH₂(c)` group (2 protons) → triplet (t)\n        *   On C3: `CH(e)` group (1 proton) → doublet (d)\n        *   On the methyl branch: `CH₃(a)` group (3 protons) → quartet (q)\n        *   The combined splitting pattern for H(d) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This is a perfect match.\n\n    *   **Proton H(e) at C3**: This proton also has three sets of neighbors on adjacent carbons.\n        *   On C4: `CH(d)` group (1 proton) → doublet (d)\n        *   On C2: `CH₂(f)` group (2 protons) → triplet (t)\n        *   On the ethyl branch: `CH₂(h)` group (2 protons) → triplet (t)\n        *   The combined splitting pattern for H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe only structure that gives both of the described complex 1H NMR signals is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**. The chemical formula for this molecule is C₉H₁₈O₂. We must now match this correct structure to the given options.\n*   Option A (`CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH`) corresponds to `C₉H₁₈O₂`.\n*   Option B corresponds to `C₇H₁₄O₂`.\n*   Option D corresponds to `C₇H₁₄O₂`.\n*   The string for C corresponds to a `C₁₀` formula.\n\nAlthough the detailed structure written for option A (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid) does not fit the NMR data, it is the only option that has the correct molecular formula (C₉H₁₈O₂) for the correct structure (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid). In multiple-choice questions of this type, it's common for there to be a typo in the condensed structural formula of an option, but the overall molecular formula is often a reliable clue. Given the perfect fit of the spectral data to an isomer with the formula `C₉H₁₈O₂`, we choose the option that represents an isomer with this formula.\n\n<<<A>>>"
