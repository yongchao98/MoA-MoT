    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis and the structure of the final product, followed by the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The carboxylic acid is brominated at the alpha-position. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted to an ester using an alcohol and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an intramolecular cyclization, similar to the malonic ester synthesis for making rings.\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This carbon is acidic because it is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion in an intermolecular SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (EtOOC)(CN)CH-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  The intermediate formed still has an acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again.\n    4.  The new carbanion performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the carbon at the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring.\n    5.  The ring consists of the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, forming a six-membered ring (cyclohexane).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon. The chemical name is 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of product 4 is:\n```\n      CN\n      |\n(C1)-CO-O-CH2(g)-CH3(h)\n  |   |\n C_ring\n```\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Chirality:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is bonded to four different groups: -CN, -COOCH2CH3, and two different paths around the ring (-CH2-C... and -CH2-C...). Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter, making the entire molecule chiral. Chiral molecules lack any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n2.  **Consequence of Chirality:** In a chiral molecule, any protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation or by a symmetry operation are chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic). The question asks for the number of \"chemically distinct hydrogens\".\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3 protons (h):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2- protons (g):** These two protons are adjacent to an oxygen, which is attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to the chiral center C1. Because of their relationship to the distant chiral center, these two protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. However, the diastereotopic effect (difference in chemical shift) decreases with distance from the stereocenter. In many cases, especially in textbook problems, such remote diastereotopic protons are considered to be \"accidentally equivalent\" (isochronous), meaning they have the same chemical shift and appear as a single signal (multiplet). Given the multiple-choice options, this simplification is likely intended. Let's count this as **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total for ethyl group = 1 + 1 = 2 signals.*\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The ring has 5 methylene (-CH2-) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral (no symmetry plane), the carbons C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all chemically distinct from one another. C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n    *   Now consider the two protons on each of these carbons. For example, on C2, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic due to their fixed spatial relationship to the substituents on the adjacent chiral center C1. This applies to every CH2 group in the ring.\n    *   Therefore, each of the 5 CH2 groups on the ring will give rise to **2 distinct proton signals**.\n    *   *Total for ring protons = 5 CH2 groups × 2 signals/group = 10 signals.*\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\nTotal Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring) = 12.\n\nTherefore, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product 4.\n\nFinal answer selection:\nA) 10\nB) 12\nC) 5\nD) 8\n\nOur calculated number is 12.\n\n<<<B>>>"
