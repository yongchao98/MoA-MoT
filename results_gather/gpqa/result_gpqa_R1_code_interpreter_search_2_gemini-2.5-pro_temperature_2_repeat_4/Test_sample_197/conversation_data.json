    "An explanation of the reasoning and thought process will be provided first, and the final answer will be given at the end.\n\n### Reasoning and Thought Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which has the formula [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M\n    *   Thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Overall stability constants (β):\n        *   β₁ = 9 for [Co(SCN)]⁺\n        *   β₂ = 40 for [Co(SCN)₂]\n        *   β₃ = 63 for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n        *   β₄ = 16 for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n3.  **Formulate the Chemical Equilibria:**\n    The formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes can be described by the following equilibria and their corresponding overall stability constants (βₙ):\n    *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺      ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])\n    *   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]       ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²)\n    *   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻      ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³)\n    *   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻      ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Define the Total Cobalt Concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n5.  **Express Complex Concentrations in Terms of [Co²⁺]:**\n    Using the stability constant expressions, we can express the concentration of each complex as a function of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] and the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻]:\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Total Concentration Equation:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 5 into the equation from step 4:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n    Factor out the common term [Co²⁺]:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n7.  **Define the Mole Fraction (αₙ):**\n    The mole fraction of a specific complex, say the n-th complex [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ, is denoted by αₙ. It is the ratio of the concentration of that complex to the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in α₂, the fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex.\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n8.  **Derive the Formula for α₂:**\n    Substitute the expressions for [[Co(SCN)₂]] (from step 5) and c(Co) (from step 6) into the equation for α₂:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, simplifying the equation:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n    This is the key formula for the calculation. Note that the calculation of the fraction depends only on the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] and the stability constants, not on the total metal ion concentration. The problem gives \"[SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M\", which we take to be the equilibrium free ligand concentration.\n\n9.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    To simplify the calculation, let's compute each term in the denominator (let's call the denominator `S`):\n    *   Let L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Term 0 (for free Co²⁺): 1\n    *   Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁L = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]): β₂L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻): β₃L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻): β₄L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    Now, sum these terms to find the denominator `S`:\n    S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    The numerator for the α₂ fraction is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex, which is `β₂L² = 0.4`.\n\n    Calculate α₂:\n    α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n    Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.92%\n\n10. **Final Answer Check:**\n    The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. This matches option D.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the manual calculation.\n```python\n# Given values\n# Stability constants for Co(II) thiocyanato complexes\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n# Thiocyanate equilibrium concentration in M\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The distribution coefficient (alpha) for the n-th complex is given by:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + sum(beta_i * [L]^i for i=1 to N))\n# We want to find alpha_2, which is the fraction of [Co(SCN)2].\n\n# Calculate each term in the denominator sum (let's call it 'S' or 'polynomial_sum')\nterm0 = 1  # For the free Co(II) ion, beta_0 is defined as 1\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc**1\nterm2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\nterm3 = beta3 * scn_conc**3\nterm4 = beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# Calculate the denominator\nS = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator for alpha_2 is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] species\nnumerator_alpha2 = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / S\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_alpha2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage_alpha2=}\")\n```\n>>>\npercentage_alpha2=16.916180326482276\n\nThe code output confirms the calculation. The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the species:** In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt-containing species, c(Co), is the sum of the free Co²⁺ ion and the various complexes:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (βₙ):** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants.\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n3.  **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂):** We need to find the fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex, which is denoted as α₂.\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 1 and 2:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    By factoring out and canceling [Co²⁺], we get a simplified formula that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Substitute the given values:**\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   **Numerator:** β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   **Denominator:**\n        *   1 (for free Co²⁺)\n        *   β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of denominator terms:** 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n6.  **Calculate the final fraction and percentage:**\n    α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100:\n    Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.92%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
