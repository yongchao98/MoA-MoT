    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The core of the question is to identify which of the four given physical theories is free from high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences that necessitate a procedure called \"regularization.\" Regularization is a mathematical technique used in quantum field theory (QFT) to handle infinite quantities that arise in calculations, typically from loop integrals that diverge at very high energies (or, equivalently, very short distances).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Option A: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):**\n    *   QED is the quantum theory of the electromagnetic force, describing interactions between light (photons) and charged particles (like electrons).\n    *   When calculating physical quantities in QED beyond the simplest tree-level interactions, one must consider \"loop diagrams.\" These represent virtual particles that pop in and out of existence for a short time.\n    *   The integrals over the momenta of these virtual particles often diverge as the momentum goes to infinity. These are known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences.\n    *   To make sense of the theory and extract finite, physical predictions, a two-step process is required:\n        1.  **Regularization:** The divergent integral is made temporarily finite by introducing a parameter, such as an energy cutoff (Λ) or by changing the dimensionality of spacetime (dimensional regularization).\n        2.  **Renormalization:** The infinite parts (which typically depend on the regularization parameter, e.g., log(Λ)) are systematically absorbed into the redefinition of fundamental constants of the theory (like the mass and charge of the electron).\n    *   **Conclusion:** QED absolutely requires regularization at high energies.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):**\n    *   QCD is the quantum theory of the strong nuclear force, describing interactions between quarks and gluons.\n    *   Like QED, QCD is a quantum field theory. Its calculational framework also relies on Feynman diagrams, including loop diagrams.\n    *   Similar to QED, these loop diagrams lead to UV divergences in calculations.\n    *   Therefore, QCD also fundamentally relies on the procedures of regularization and renormalization to be a predictive theory.\n    *   **Conclusion:** QCD requires regularization at high energies.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Option C: Superstring Theory:**\n    *   Superstring Theory is a candidate \"theory of everything\" that aims to unify general relativity (gravity) with quantum mechanics.\n    *   A key feature of string theory is that it replaces the concept of point-like fundamental particles with one-dimensional, vibrating objects called strings.\n    *   Interactions, which in QFT occur at a single point in spacetime, are \"smeared out\" in string theory because they involve the interaction of these extended objects.\n    *   This \"smearing\" has a profound consequence: it naturally softens the interactions at very short distances (high energies). The loop diagrams in string theory, which correspond to the UV-divergent diagrams in QFT, turn out to be finite.\n    *   Because the theory is believed to be inherently free of these UV divergences, it is called a \"UV-complete\" theory.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Superstring Theory, by its very structure, is believed not to require regularization for high-energy divergences. It is constructed, in part, specifically to solve this problem.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Option D: Classical Electrodynamics:**\n    *   This theory is described by Maxwell's equations. It is not a quantum theory.\n    *   The specific type of regularization the question refers to (handling divergent loop integrals) is a feature of *quantum* field theory. Since classical electrodynamics doesn't have quantum loops, it doesn't need regularization *in that sense*.\n    *   However, classical electrodynamics has its own severe high-energy problem. If you model the electron as a true mathematical point charge, its self-energy (the energy stored in its own electric field) is infinite. This divergence occurs as you integrate the energy density of the field down to a radius of zero.\n    *   Attempts to \"fix\" this, for instance by giving the electron a small but finite radius, can be seen as a form of regularization. This problem historically indicated the breakdown of classical physics at short distances and was a motivation for developing quantum mechanics.\n    *   While it has a high-energy problem, it's different from the loop divergences of QFT. Comparing the options, Superstring Theory is the only one that is proposed as a fully consistent theory at arbitrarily high energies without needing *any* ad-hoc fix or procedure. The question asks which theory *never requires* regularization. While one can debate the terminology for the classical case, QED and QCD definitively require it in the standard modern context, and Superstring Theory is specifically designed to avoid it.\n\n6.  **Final Comparison:**\n    *   A (QED) and B (QCD) are the archetypal examples of theories that *need* regularization.\n    *   C (Superstring Theory) is the archetypal example of a candidate theory that *avoids the need* for regularization.\n    *   D (Classical Electrodynamics) has a different kind of high-energy infinity problem, but it's not the context usually meant by \"regularization at high energies\" in modern physics. Even so, it is not a well-behaved theory at high energies.\n    *   The clearest and most accurate answer is Superstring Theory.\n\n<<<C>>>"
