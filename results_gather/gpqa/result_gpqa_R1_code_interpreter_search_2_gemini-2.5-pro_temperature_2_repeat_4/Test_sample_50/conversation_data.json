    "This problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` located a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. \"Grounded\" means the potential of the sphere is held at a constant V = 0. The charge `q` induces an opposite charge distribution on the surface of the sphere.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be modeled by removing the sphere and replacing it with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. For this replacement to be valid, the potential on the spherical surface (at radius R) must be zero, just like the grounded conductor.\n\n3.  **Image Charge and Position:** For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center, along the same line as `q`) are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2/d`\n\n4.  **Calculating Potential Energy:** The net potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A general formula for the potential energy of a charge configuration is `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`, where `ρ` is the charge density and `V` is the potential.\n\n    For our system of the point charge `q` and the induced surface charge `σ` on the sphere, this becomes:\n    `U = (1/2) * [ q * V_at_q + ∫(σ * V_sphere) dA ]`\n\n    *   `V_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere, which is 0 because it is grounded. So, the integral term is zero.\n    *   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` *due to all other charges*, which in this case are the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n5.  **Finding the Induced Potential:** The method of images tells us that the potential outside the sphere due to the induced charges is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    Therefore, `V_induced` at the location of `q` is the potential generated by `q'` at distance `d` from the center.\n\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n    *   The potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        Substituting the values for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Final Energy Calculation:** Now we substitute this potential back into our energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
