    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the spectroscopic data to identify Compound X.**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad peak):** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong peak):** This falls in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the O-H stretch, this is assigned to the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n    *Conclusion from IR:* The data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield (deshielded) broad singlet for one proton is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic A₂B₂ pattern. This pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely the two protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm represents the two protons adjacent to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (the remaining signals):**\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This proton is likely attached to the carbon directly bonded to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton). Its multiplicity (m, multiplet) indicates it's coupled to several neighboring protons.\n        *   To figure out the structure of the alkyl group, let's analyze the remaining signals together:\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3H suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This points to an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2H. This corresponds to the -CH₂- group of the ethyl fragment. It appears as a multiplet because it is coupled to both the terminal -CH₃ group and the benzylic proton (at 2.9 ppm).\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3H indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-). This single proton must be the benzylic proton at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We have a central CH proton (the benzylic one) attached to the benzene ring. This CH is bonded to a methyl group (giving the 1.4 ppm doublet) and an ethyl group (giving the 1.7 ppm multiplet and 0.9 ppm triplet). This describes a **sec-butyl** group: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`.\n\n    *Conclusion from NMR:* The ¹H NMR data confirms a carboxylic acid group and a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The second substituent is a sec-butyl group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:**\n    Putting all the pieces together, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (C), which is the starting material.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reaction and identify the final product.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to the corresponding alkyl group (in this case, a methyl group). The reaction is:\n    `Ar-COOH + 6HI —(red P)→ Ar-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂`\n    The saturated alkyl substituent (sec-butyl group) and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The resulting molecule has a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 4 and a methyl group at position 1. The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**. It can also be called 4-sec-butyltoluene.\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This matches our identified final product.\n*   B) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: The alkyl group is incorrect.\n*   C) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n*   D) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This structure is inconsistent with the NMR data and the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
