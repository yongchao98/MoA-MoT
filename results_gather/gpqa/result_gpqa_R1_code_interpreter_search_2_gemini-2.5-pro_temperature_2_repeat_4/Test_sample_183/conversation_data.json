    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe relative positions of the groups are crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   The ethoxy group and the tert-butyl group are *ortho* to each other.\n*   The ethoxy group and the nitro group are *meta* to each other.\n*   The tert-butyl group and the nitro group are *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nThe order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring is determined by their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OCH2CH3 (Ethoxy):** A strong activating group, and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-Butyl):** A weak activating group, and an *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the ortho positions.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** A strong deactivating group, and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino):** A precursor to the ethoxy group. It is a very strong activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. In strong acid, it protonates to -NH3+, which becomes a strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director. This dual nature is often key in complex syntheses.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nWe must start with benzene. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n*   Step i: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline (reduction).\n*   Step iii: Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on anilines because the lone pair on the nitrogen atom (a Lewis base) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing alkylation. Thus, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n*   Step i: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitration -> Likely p-tert-butylnitrobenzene.\n*   Step iii: Sulfonation.\n*   Step iv: `NaNO2/HCl`. This reagent is used for diazotization, which requires an amino (-NH2) group. At this stage of the synthesis, there is no amino group on the ring. Therefore, this step is impossible. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n*   This sequence attempts to use a sulfonation blocking group strategy.\n*   Step i-v could plausibly generate a diazonium salt intermediate.\n*   Step vi: `HNO3/H2SO4`. Applying nitrating conditions to a diazonium salt is not a standard or stable procedure. Diazonium salts are typically used immediately after formation and are thermally unstable. Trying to nitrate it would be dangerous and would not lead to the desired product. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n\nThis option, by elimination, should be the correct one. Let's trace the steps logically.\n*(Note: The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. Some steps here may not be high-yield in practice, but this route is the only chemically plausible one among the choices. The final two steps, viii and ix, seem superfluous and are likely an error in the question's provided option list, as they would sulfonate and then immediately desulfonate the final product.)*\n\nLet's focus on steps i-vii, which lead to the target molecule.\n\n*   **Step i: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene**\n    *   Product: *tert-butylbenzene*. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n*   **Step ii: `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene**\n    *   This is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but due to its bulk, the major product is *p-tert-butylnitrobenzene*. The desired *o-tert-butylnitrobenzene* is the minor product. For the synthesis to proceed, we must use this minor isomer.\n\n*   **Step iii: `Fe/HCl` on o-tert-butylnitrobenzene**\n    *   This reduces the nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Product: *o-tert-butylaniline* (NH2 at C1, tBu at C2).\n\n*   **Step iv: `HNO3/H2SO4` on o-tert-butylaniline**\n    *   This is the key step for establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   The -NH3+ group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   The -tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   The -NH3+ at C1 directs the incoming nitro group to position C3. Although the tBu group at C2 directs elsewhere (C4, C6), the meta-directing effect of the anilinium group allows for the formation of the desired product.\n    *   Product: *2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline* (NH2 at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3).\n\n*   **Step v: `NaNO2/HCl` on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**\n    *   This is diazotization, converting the primary amino group into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   Product: *2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt*.\n\n*   **Step vi: `H3O+, H2O/Heat` on the diazonium salt**\n    *   Heating the diazonium salt in aqueous acid replaces the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Product: *2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol*.\n\n*   **Step vii: `NaOH/EtBr` on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n    *   This is a Williamson ether synthesis. NaOH deprotonates the phenol to form a phenoxide ion, which then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n    *   Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDespite potential yield issues, the sequence of reactions in option B (specifically steps i-vii) provides a chemically logical pathway to the desired product. The other options contain fundamentally flawed or impossible chemical steps. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
