    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-, in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\nThe solution is created by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates to form K+ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-). H2PO4- is a weak acid.\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates to form 2Na+, the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), and water. HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n*   Together, H2PO4- and HPO4^2- form a buffer solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Equilibria**\nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n1.  H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5 x 10^-3)\n2.  H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-  (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8)\n3.  HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-   (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12)\n\nThe primary equilibrium that determines the pH of the buffer is the second one, involving the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- pair. The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed in the third equilibrium.\n\n**3. Strategy**\nThe calculation will be done in three main steps:\n*   **Step A:** Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components, H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n*   **Step B:** Use the second dissociation equilibrium (Ka2) and the concentrations from Step A to find the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the solution.\n*   **Step C:** Use the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka3), the [H+] from Step B, and the concentration of HPO4^2- to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4^3-].\n\n**4. Execution using Code**\nWe will perform the calculations for each step using a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Masses\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\n\n# Molar Masses\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\n\n# Volume\nV_L = 0.200  # L (200.00 cm^3)\n\n# Acid Dissociation Constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# --- Step A: Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations ---\n# Moles of each component\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Concentrations of each component\n# H2PO4- comes from KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / V_L\n# HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4.2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / V_L\n\n# --- Step B: Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+] ---\n# Using the Ka2 expression for the buffer equilibrium: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# We can rearrange to solve for [H+].\n# The volume term V_L cancels out if we use moles directly, so let's do that for precision.\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (moles_H2PO4_minus / moles_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# --- Step C: Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-] ---\n# Using the Ka3 expression: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# Rearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<answer content>>>\nB",
    "This is a chemistry problem involving a buffer solution and successive acid dissociations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculation.\n\n**1. Identify the components and their initial concentrations:**\n*   The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolved in water.\n*   KH2PO4 provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H2PO4-.\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO4^2-.\n*   The pair H2PO4- / HPO4^2- forms a buffer.\n*   We first need to calculate the molar concentration of each of these ions.\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of Each Component:**\n*   Moles of H2PO4- = Mass of KH2PO4 / Molar mass of KH2PO4\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O / Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**3. Calculate Molar Concentrations:**\n*   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n*   Concentration of H2PO4- = Moles of H2PO4- / Volume (L)\n    *   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Concentration of HPO4^2- = Moles of HPO4^2- / Volume (L)\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Determine the pH and [H+] of the Buffer:**\n*   The relevant equilibrium for the buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻      (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸)\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the Ka2 expression directly to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+].\n*   Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n*   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka2 * [H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) = 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**5.

Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 3.97x10^-7 M\nB) 2.81x10^-7 M\nC) 5.48x10^-7 M\nD) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The goal is to determine the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻.\n\n**1. Initial Setup and Concentrations**\nFirst, we determine the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n*   Source of H₂PO₄⁻ is KH₂PO₄ (Molar Mass = 136.09 g/mol).\n*   Source of HPO₄²⁻ is Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (Molar Mass = 177.99 g/mol).\n*   Volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n    *   Initial [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Initial [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**2. Finding the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\nThe H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair constitutes a buffer. The pH and thus the [H⁺] are determined by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid:\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻       (Kₐ₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸)\n\nThe equilibrium expression is: Kₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) = 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n**3. Finding the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation step:\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻       (Kₐ₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²)\n\nThe equilibrium expression is: Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\nNow, we rearrange to solve for the unknown, [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n\nWe use the concentrations calculated in the previous steps. The change in [HPO₄²⁻] due to this third, very weak dissociation is negligible, so we can use its initial concentration.\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] = 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe provided code performs these calculations precisely, yielding the result `6.24e-07`.\n\nThis calculated value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
