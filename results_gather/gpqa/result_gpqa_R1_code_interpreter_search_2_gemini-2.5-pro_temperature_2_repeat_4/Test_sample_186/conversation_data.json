    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the apparent V magnitude of each listed star and then check if it's detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m VLT telescope with a 1-hour exposure to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO detectability.**\n\nAccording to the ESPRESSO User Manual (and its overview page), the spectrograph can achieve an S/N of 10 in a 1-hour exposure for a star with a V magnitude of approximately 16.5 when used with one of the VLT's 8m Unit Telescopes (UT). This will be our detection threshold. Any star with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than or equal to 16.5 (i.e., m_V ≤ 16.5) will be considered detectable.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the apparent V magnitude for each star.**\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky. Its apparent V magnitude is -0.74. Since -0.74 is much smaller (brighter) than 16.5, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:** Polaris (the North Star) has an apparent V magnitude of approximately +1.98. Since 1.98 < 16.5, Polaris is **detectable**.\n\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:**\n    We use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (m_V):\n    m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10 pc)\n    Given: M_V = 15, d = 10 pc\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10)\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(1)\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15.0\n    Since 15.0 < 16.5, this star is **detectable**.\n\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:**\n    Given: M_V = 15, d = 200 pc\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10)\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(20)\n    m_V ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505\n    Since 21.505 > 16.5, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:**\n    Given: M_V = 15, d = 5 pc\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10)\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5)\n    m_V ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495\n    Since 13.495 < 16.5, this star is **detectable**.\n\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:**\n    Given: M_V = 15, d = 50 pc\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10)\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5)\n    m_V ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495\n    Since 18.495 > 16.5, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**Step 3: Count the detectable stars.**\n\nThe detectable stars are:\n1.  Canopus (m_V = -0.74)\n2.  Polaris (m_V = +1.98)\n3.  Star at 10 pc (m_V = 15.0)\n4.  Star at 5 pc (m_V = 13.5)\n\nThere are a total of 4 detectable stars.\n\n<<<A>>>"
