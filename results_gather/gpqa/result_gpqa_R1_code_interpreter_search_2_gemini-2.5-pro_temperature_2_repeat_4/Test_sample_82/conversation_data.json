    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations.\n\n### **Part 1: Initial State and Dilution**\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation:**\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final volume of acetic acid solution (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, we find the new concentration (M2):\n        M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n        This is the concentration of the acetic acid we will titrate.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base (acetate, CH₃COO⁻), and 75% remains as acetic acid (CH₃COOH). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Reaction:** CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n2.  **Buffer Composition:** At this point, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n3.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** The pH of a buffer is calculated using this equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n4.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n5.  **Calculate pH:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, which hydrolyzes in water.\n\n1.  **Find the Volume to Equivalence (Ve):**\n    *   Moles of acid = M_acid * V_acid = 0.025 mol/L * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   Ve (Volume of NaOH) = Moles of acid / M_base = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = **10.00 cm³**\n2.  **Calculate Total Volume and Concentration of Acetate:**\n    *   Total Volume = Initial acid volume + Ve = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   Moles of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) formed = Initial moles of acid = 0.001 mol\n    *   Concentration of acetate = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n3.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion acts as a weak base:\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n4.  **Calculate Kb:**\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n5.  **Calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    *   From the hydrolysis reaction, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   Let [OH⁻] = x. Then [CH₃COOH] = x, and [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x). Assuming x is small, we get x² / 0.02.\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n6.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated pH values are **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nM_acid_initial = 0.05\nV_acid_initial = 20.00  # in cm3\nV_water = 20.00  # in cm3\nM_base = 0.1\n\n# Part 1: Dilution\nV_acid_final = V_acid_initial + V_water\nM_acid_final = (M_acid_initial * V_acid_initial) / V_acid_final\n\n# --- pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles of acid to be titrated\nmoles_acid = M_acid_final * (V_acid_final / 1000)\n\n# Volume of base to reach equivalence (Ve) in L\nVe_L = moles_acid / M_base\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point in L\ntotal_volume_eq = (V_acid_final / 1000) + Ve_L\n\n# Concentration of conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence\nconc_base_eq = moles_acid / total_volume_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_base_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Based on the detailed reasoning and the python code execution, the following values were calculated:\n\n1.  **pH at 25% Titration**: When 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, a buffer solution is formed where the ratio of the conjugate base (acetate) to the acid (acetic acid) is 25:75, or 1:3. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   pH = pKa + log([acetate]/[acetic acid])\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26\n\n2.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base. The calculation, considering the total volume and the concentration of the acetate ion, results in an [OH⁻] concentration that gives a pOH of approximately 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. These values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
