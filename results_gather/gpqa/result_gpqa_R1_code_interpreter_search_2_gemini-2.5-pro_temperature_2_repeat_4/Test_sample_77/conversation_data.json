    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Concepts**: The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, c. Therefore, the potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ are not determined by the state of the charge at time $t$, but by its state at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the \"retarded time\". The retarded time is the time at which the charge emitted the signal (field) that reaches the point $\\vec{r}$ exactly at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Defining Variables from the Problem Statement**:\n    *   `q`: the point charge.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t)$: the trajectory of the charge, its position vector at time t.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: the observation point (field point).\n    *   $t$: the time of observation.\n    *   $t_r$: the retarded time, the time when the field was generated. The condition for the retarded time is that the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is equal to $t-t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. Thus, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d$: the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$, so $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$, so $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   Constants: `c` (speed of light), $\\epsilon_0$ (permittivity of free space), $\\mu_0$ (permeability of free space).\n\n3.  **The Retarded Time Condition**: The time difference $t-t_r$ is the time it takes for light to travel the distance $d$. Therefore,\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n    or\n    $c(t - t_r) = d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    This is an implicit equation to find $t_r$ for a given $\\vec{r}$ and $t$.\n\n4.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general formulas for retarded potentials by substituting the charge and current densities for a point charge. The standard results are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. In terms of the variables defined above, they are:\n\n    *   Scalar Potential:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n        where all quantities on the right-hand side (d, $\\vec{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n    *   Vector Potential:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right] = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        (Note that $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$, which leads to the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$).\n\n5.  **Matching with the Given Options**: Let's re-arrange the expressions for the potentials to match the format of the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n    *   Scalar Potential $V(\\vec{r},t)$:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   Vector Potential $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: These derived expressions match exactly with option D.\n\n    *   Option A represents static potentials (Coulomb's law), which is incorrect for a moving charge where retardation effects are crucial.\n    *   Option B has the wrong sign in the denominator ($+$ instead of $-$). The negative sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect on the potentials.\n    *   Option C also uses a static-like potential for V, ignoring retardation and the relativistic denominator.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
