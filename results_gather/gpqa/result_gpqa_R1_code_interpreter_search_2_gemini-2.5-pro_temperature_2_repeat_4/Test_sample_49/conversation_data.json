    "This problem requires understanding the structure of perturbative calculations in quantum field theory, specifically how different parts of a mathematical expression for a Feynman diagram's amplitude relate to the diagram's properties like the number of vertices and loops.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given expression:**\n    The expression is `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`. We need to dissect it to find clues about the number of loops.\n\n2.  **Identify the coupling constants:**\n    *   `alpha^3`: `alpha` (the fine-structure constant) is a coupling constant. The power `3` indicates that the diagram has 3 vertices corresponding to the interaction governed by `alpha`.\n    *   `g^2`: `g` is another coupling constant. The power `2` indicates 2 vertices corresponding to the interaction governed by `g`.\n    *   The total number of vertices (`V`) in the diagram is the sum of the vertices of each type: `V = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n\n3.  **Identify the loop factor:**\n    *   In quantum field theory calculations, loops in Feynman diagrams correspond to integrals over undetermined momenta of virtual particles.\n    *   When these loop integrals are calculated, particularly using the technique of dimensional regularization in `d` spacetime dimensions, they systematically produce factors of `1/(4π)^(d/2)` for each loop.\n    *   The problem specifies a **four-dimensional spacetime**, so we set `d=4`.\n    *   For a diagram with `L` loops in `d=4` dimensions, the resulting expression will contain a factor of `[1 / (4π)^(4/2)]^L = [1 / (4π)^2]^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`.\n    *   Our given expression contains the factor `1 / (4π)^6`.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of loops (L):**\n    *   We can find `L` by equating the power of `(4π)` in the general formula with the power in the given expression.\n    *   General formula's power: `2L`\n    *   Given expression's power: `6`\n    *   Setting them equal: `2L = 6`\n    *   Solving for `L`: `L = 3`\n\n5.  **Analyze the remaining factors:**\n    *   `sqrt(2)` and `8`: These are numerical factors. They typically arise from symmetry factors of the diagram, group theory calculations (e.g., traces of matrices), or from the evaluation of gamma functions and other special functions that appear in the loop integrals. They don't provide a general rule for the number of loops.\n    *   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of two energy scales (`Q` and `M`), likely an external momentum scale and a particle mass. Such terms are the result of evaluating the loop integrals and depend on the masses and momenta flowing through the diagram. The power (in this case, `2`) is determined by dimensional analysis and the specifics of the integral, not the loop number itself.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most reliable indicator of the loop order from the given expression is the power of `1/(4π)`. Based on this standard convention in quantum field theory, a factor of `1/(4π)^6` in four dimensions points unambiguously to a 3-loop diagram.\n\nThe number of loops in the Feynman diagram was 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
