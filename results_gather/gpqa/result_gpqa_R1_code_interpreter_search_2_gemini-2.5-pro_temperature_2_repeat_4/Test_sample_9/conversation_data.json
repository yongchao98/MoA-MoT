    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Understand the core concept:** Planetary density is determined by two primary factors:\n    *   **Composition:** The intrinsic density of the materials the planet is made of (e.g., iron is denser than silicate rock, which is denser than water ice).\n    *   **Gravitational Compression:** The planet's own gravity squeezes its material, increasing its overall density. A more massive planet has stronger gravity and therefore experiences greater compression.\n\n2.  **Analyze each option based on these principles:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline reference, which is essentially the planet Earth. Its average density is approximately **5.51 g/cm³**.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density of this planet is given as **~5.5 g/cm³**, which is very close to Earth's density. Although it is more massive than Earth, its density isn't higher. This implies that if it were made of the same materials as Earth, its density *would* be higher due to compression. The fact that it isn't suggests its intrinsic composition is less dense than Earth's (e.g., it has a smaller iron core or a higher fraction of lighter elements).\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth but is only half as massive. With less mass, its self-gravity is weaker. This leads to *less* gravitational compression compared to Earth. Therefore, its average density will be **lower than Earth's density** (< 5.5 g/cm³).\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet is made of the same materials as Earth but is significantly more massive. Its powerful gravity will cause extreme compression of its internal structure. This compression effect far outweighs the increase in volume, leading to a much **higher average density than Earth's density** (> 5.5 g/cm³).\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density(d) < Density(a)\n    *   Density(a) ≈ Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > Density(a)\n\n    The clear ranking from lowest to highest density is: Planet (d) < Planet (a) ≈ Planet (b) < Planet (c).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The planet in option (c) is the most massive planet with an Earth-like composition, meaning it will undergo the most significant gravitational compression and thus have the highest density.\n\nThe correct choice is (c). This corresponds to answer A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
