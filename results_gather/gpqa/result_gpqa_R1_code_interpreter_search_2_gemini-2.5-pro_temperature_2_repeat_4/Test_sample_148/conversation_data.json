    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of two distinct peaks for a single proton (the alpha-proton) indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the two environments must belong to two different molecular species.\n    *   The fact that the peaks have roughly equal integrals summing to 1H means the two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n    *   These two species are very similar chemically, as indicated by their similar chemical shifts.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   The presence of two peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace confirms that there are two distinct, separable compounds in the mixture. The equal intensities support the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n    *   The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product, is crucial. It means the two compounds are isomers—they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but different structural arrangements.\n    *   The separation occurs even at an elevated temperature, suggesting that the two species are stable isomers and not, for example, rapidly interconverting conformers (rotamers) which would likely coalesce into a single peak at high temperature.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** \"Double coupling\" is not a standard term for a side reaction. A side reaction that changes the molecular structure in such a way would almost certainly change the mass, which contradicts the MS data.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n        *   They have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass (consistent with MS data).\n        *   They are different compounds with different physical properties, so they can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC (consistent with two LC peaks).\n        *   Protons in diastereomers exist in different chemical environments, leading to different NMR chemical shifts (consistent with two NMR peaks).\n        *   This situation commonly arises in peptide synthesis if one of the chiral amino acid starting materials was not enantiopure (e.g., a mixture of D and L forms was used) or if epimerization (racemization at one chiral center) occurred during the coupling reaction. This would produce a mixture of diastereomers in solution. This explanation fits all the observations perfectly.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. This is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In a standard, achiral environment (like a typical NMR solvent or a standard LC column), enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce only one set of peaks in the NMR spectrum and elute as a single peak on a standard LC column.\n        *   To distinguish enantiomers, chiral conditions are required (e.g., a chiral NMR solvent or a chiral LC column). The problem does not state such conditions were used. Therefore, this explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only explanation that cohesively accounts for all the experimental data—two NMR peaks, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass spectra—is the presence of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
