    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, tricyclic alkane with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions (C1 and C3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) at high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Standard elimination (E2) is disfavored due to the rigidity of the adamantane cage, which prevents the formation of an anti-periplanar conformation required for E2. Also, the formation of a double bond at a bridgehead (adamantene) would violate Bredt's rule and lead to a highly unstable intermediate.\n*   Given the forcing conditions, a complex rearrangement is likely. The provided spectroscopic data for **Product 1** is:\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The total integration (14H) indicates that the C₁₀H₁₄ framework of the starting material is retained. The formula of Product 1 is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The unusual chemical shift at 4.79 ppm and the simple NMR pattern are characteristic of a rearranged tricyclic ketone, but its exact identification from first principles is difficult and not strictly necessary to solve the problem, as long as we can deduce the subsequent steps. The problem lies within a known, albeit complex, reaction sequence in adamantane chemistry.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Product 1 (a ketone) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃) and heated.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of ketones to alcohols. The subsequent reaction, ozonolysis, requires a C=C double bond. This strongly implies that the reaction is a **reduction followed by dehydration**.\n    *   Product 1 (Ketone, C₁₀H₁₄O) → Intermediate Alcohol (C₁₀H₁₆O) → **Product 2** (Alkene, C₁₀H₁₄).\n*   The identity of the alkene (Product 2) depends on the structure of the ketone (Product 1). A known, though not immediately obvious, transformation in this sequence involves the rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton. The overall transformation from 1,3-dibromoadamantane can lead, via intermediates, to the highly strained but transient **adamantene** (tricyclo[3.3.1.1³⁷]dec-1-ene). This species is a plausible structure for Product 2, being a C₁₀H₁₄ alkene. While its formation is complex, its subsequent reaction is clear. Let's assume **Product 2 is adamantene**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the formation of Product 3 and its NMR spectrum**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Product 2 (alkene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard ozonolysis with reductive workup, which cleaves a C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (ketones or aldehydes).\n*   **Reaction:** Let's apply this to our proposed Product 2, adamantene. Adamantene has a double bond between a bridgehead carbon (C1) and an adjacent methylene carbon (C2).\n    *   The bridgehead carbon (C1) is tertiary (bonded to three other carbons in the cage). After cleavage, it becomes a ketone group within a larger ring system.\n    *   The methylene carbon (C2) is secondary (a CH₂ group). In adamantene, it's a CH group (part of C=CH). After cleavage, it becomes an aldehyde group (CHO).\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The cleavage of the C1=C2 bond in the adamantane framework opens one of the rings, resulting in a bicyclic structure. The product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one-7-carbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one-7-carbaldehyde.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In this keto-aldehyde, the most deshielded proton (excluding any acidic enol protons) is the **aldehydic proton (-CHO)**, which typically appears at δ 9-10 ppm.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern of this aldehyde proton's signal. The splitting is caused by spin-spin coupling to nearby protons.\n    1.  **Alpha (α) Coupling (³J):** The aldehyde group is attached to C7 of the bicyclic system. C7 is a bridgehead carbon, which is a methine group (CH). The aldehyde proton will couple to this single proton on C7. This ³J coupling (three bonds: H-C-C-H) will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  **Beta (β) Long-Range Coupling (⁴J):** In rigid bicyclic systems, long-range coupling over four bonds can be significant if the coupled protons form a \"W\" shape (a zig-zag path). The aldehyde proton at C7 can potentially couple with protons on the β-carbons, which are C1, C6, and C8. Let's analyze the geometry:\n        *   The H on C1 might couple.\n        *   The two protons on C6 and the two on C8 are candidates for \"W\" coupling. The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton holds these protons in relatively fixed positions. It is plausible that one proton on C6 and one proton on C8 (specifically the exo protons) are in a \"W\" conformation with respect to the aldehyde proton (assuming a certain orientation of the CHO group).\n        *   Due to the near-symmetry of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework with respect to the C7 position, the two exo-protons on C6 and C8 are approximately chemically and magnetically equivalent.\n    3.  **Combined Splitting:** If the aldehyde proton couples to the single proton at C7 (H₇) and also to two equivalent exo-protons at C6 and C8, the signal will be split as follows:\n        *   The coupling to one H₇ splits the signal into a doublet.\n        *   The coupling to two equivalent β-protons splits each line of the doublet into a triplet (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n*   **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nComparing this deduction with the given options:\nA) doublet of triplets\nB) triplet of triplets\nC) triplet\nD) pentet\n\nOur derived pattern matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
