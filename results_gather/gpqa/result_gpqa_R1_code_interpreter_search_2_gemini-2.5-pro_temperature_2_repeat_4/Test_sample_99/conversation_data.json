    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A and the subsequent products.**\n    *   **Compound A** has the molecular formula C3H6. This corresponds to the general formula for alkenes (CnH2n). The most common isomer is **propene (CH3-CH=CH2)**.\n    *   **Reaction 1:** Propene (A) reacts with bromine (Br2) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). This is an electrophilic addition reaction where bromine adds across the double bond.\n        CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 → CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n        **Compound B** is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n    *   **Reaction 2:** Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base in an alcohol solvent, which promotes double dehydrohalogenation (removal of 2 HBr molecules) from a vicinal dihalide to form an alkyne.\n        CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alc.) → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n        **Compound C** is **propyne**.\n    *   **Reaction 3:** Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This reaction causes cyclic polymerization (trimerization) of alkynes to form an aromatic ring. Three molecules of propyne will form a trimethyl-substituted benzene ring.\n        3 CH3-C≡CH → 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)\n        **Compound D** is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n    *   **Reaction 4:** Compound D (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This typically refers to the nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO3 and concentrated H2SO4), used for the nitration of aromatic rings. The methyl groups are activating and ortho-, para-directing. In mesitylene, all available positions (2, 4, 6) are equivalent and highly activated.\n        Mesitylene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + H2O\n        **Compound E** is **2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene** (or nitromesitylene).\n    *   **Reaction 5:** Compound E (nitromesitylene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n        Nitromesitylene + Fe/HCl → 2,4,6-trimethylaniline + H2O\n        **Compound F** is **2,4,6-trimethylaniline** (or mesidine).\n    *   **Reaction 6:** Compound F (an aromatic primary amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, generated in situ from NaNO2/HCl at low temperature). This is the diazotization reaction, which forms a diazonium salt.\n        2,4,6-trimethylaniline + HNO2 → 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt\n        **Compound G** is the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n    *   **Reaction 7:** Compound G (diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt (hydrolysis) replaces the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a phenol. The NaOH helps in neutralizing the acid present and facilitates the reaction.\n        2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt + H2O (with NaOH, warm) → 2,4,6-trimethylphenol + N2\n        **Compound H** is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each statement.**\n    *   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n        *   Compound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature. As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n    *   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n        *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produce a distinct violet, purple, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex.\n        *   However, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol is a sterically hindered phenol due to the two methyl groups at the ortho positions (positions 2 and 6) next to the -OH group. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex with FeCl3.\n        *   Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a *negative* ferric chloride test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution remains the yellow/brown color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that H \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading; it doesn't produce a new yellow substance, it simply fails to react. In the context of a characteristic test, this statement is considered **incorrect** because it implies a positive result or a specific reaction product color which is not the case. The expected positive result for a phenol is a violet color.\n    *   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n        *   Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are only two types of chemically non-equivalent protons:\n            1.  The 9 protons of the three equivalent methyl groups. They will appear as one signal, a singlet (no adjacent protons to split the signal).\n            2.  The 3 protons on the aromatic ring, which are also equivalent to each other. They will appear as a second signal, also a singlet.\n        *   Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of D will show two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n    *   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n        *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines (derivatives of aniline) are fundamental building blocks in the synthesis of azo dyes. They are converted to diazonium salts (like compound G) and then coupled with other aromatic compounds to form brightly colored azo compounds. This statement is **correct**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.**\n    Statements A, C, and D are correct. Statement B is incorrect because 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, being sterically hindered, does not give a positive ferric chloride test; it does not form the characteristic violet complex.\n\n<<<B>>>"
