    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    1.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n        *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    2.  A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    1.  **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct bands in the 3300-3500 cm-1 region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide would typically absorb at slightly lower frequencies.\n    2.  **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is too high for a simple amide (which is usually < 1700 cm-1). It is characteristic of an ester, which typically absorbs between 1735-1750 cm-1. Conjugation with an aromatic ring can lower this frequency, so 1720 cm-1 is a very reasonable value for an ester attached to a benzene ring.\n    3.  **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    1.  **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This signal is typical for a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is the upfield part of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    2.  **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the methyl group identified above. The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is highly indicative of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom, specifically in an ester (-O-CH2-). These two signals (1.20 ppm triplet and 4.5 ppm quartet) definitively identify an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. Broad signals are often due to exchangeable protons like O-H or N-H. Consistent with the IR data, this signal represents the two protons of the primary amine group (-NH2). The chemical shift is typical for an aniline-type amine.\n    4.  **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two sets of protons are chemically different due to the different electronic nature of the substituents.\n        *   The amino group (-NH2) is a strong electron-donating group, which shields adjacent protons, shifting them upfield.\n        *   The ethyl ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields adjacent protons, shifting them downfield.\n        *   Therefore, the doublet at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH2 group.\n        *   The doublet at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -COOCH2CH3 group.\n\n*   **Putting it all together**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   This leads to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C (from COO) + C2H5 (from ethyl) + N + H2 (from NH2) + O2 = C9H11NO2. The formula matches.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Wrong functional group (amide not ester), wrong substitution pattern (meta not para).\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (C=O), not the ester oxygen. The NMR for the CH2 would be ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Wrong functional group (secondary amide), would only show one N-H peak in IR and a different NMR pattern (e.g., a formyl proton signal ~8 ppm).\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all the data perfectly.\n\nThe compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
