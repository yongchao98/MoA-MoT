    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as an oscillating electric dipole, assuming its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. The radiation from such a dipole is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the Larmor formula for a dipole:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `C` is a constant that depends on the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation but not on the angle `θ`.\n*   `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (which is the z-axis in this problem).\n\nThe function `f` mentioned in the question is this power per unit solid angle:\n`f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`\n\nThe maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (or `π/2` radians). Therefore:\n\n`A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`\n\nNow, we need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n\nPower at 30° = `C * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nSo, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThe power radiated at 30° is `C * (1/4) = A / 4`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n(Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power A) = `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nNow, let's determine the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength `λ`. The full expression for the power per unit solid angle is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * ε₀ * c³) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is:\n\n`ω = 2πν` and `c = νλ`, where `ν` is the frequency.\nSubstituting `ν = c/λ`, we get `ω = 2πc / λ`.\n\nTherefore, the power is proportional to `ω⁴`:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴ = (2πc / λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, a possible form for the function `f(λ, θ)` includes a `λ⁻⁴` term. This is the characteristic wavelength dependence for electric dipole radiation, which is also the basis for Rayleigh scattering (explaining why the sky is blue).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The radiated power per unit solid angle, `f`, is proportional to **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\nA) 1/2, `λ⁻⁴`\nB) 1/4, `λ⁻³`\nC) 3/4, `λ⁻⁶`\nD) 1/4, `λ⁻⁴`\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
