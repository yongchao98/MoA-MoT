    "To determine the correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation, we need to examine the key assumptions made in its derivation.\n\nThe Mott-Gurney equation is:\n$ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\n\nThis equation is derived by solving the Poisson's equation and the drift-current equation under a specific set of physical conditions. The primary assumptions are:\n\n1.  **Single-Carrier Device**: The model assumes that the current is carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes. The contribution from the other carrier type is considered negligible.\n2.  **Ideal (Ohmic) Contact**: It is assumed that there is a perfect Ohmic contact at the injecting electrode. This means the contact can supply an unlimited number of charge carriers into the device, and there is no energy barrier for carrier injection. The current is therefore limited by the charge transport through the bulk of the material (the \"space charge\") and not by the injection process at the contact. A contact with \"no carrier injection barrier\" is the ideal Ohmic contact required for this model. A Schottky contact, by contrast, has an inherent injection barrier.\n3.  **Trap-Free Material**: The derivation assumes the semiconductor or insulator is perfectly free of trap states within its bandgap. If traps were present, they would capture some of the injected carriers, leading to a different voltage dependence known as trap-limited SCLC.\n4.  **Drift-Dominated Current**: The model assumes that the total current is dominated by the drift of carriers under the applied electric field. The current arising from the diffusion of carriers due to concentration gradients is assumed to be negligible. This is a valid assumption for devices that are not extremely thin and under a sufficiently high applied voltage.\n\nNow let's evaluate each of the given options based on these assumptions:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    This statement is incorrect because a Schottky contact has an energy barrier to injection, which would limit the current. The Mott-Gurney law requires an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier) that can supply enough carriers to form the space charge.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    This statement is incorrect because it states \"negligible drift current\". The space-charge-limited current is fundamentally a drift current. If the drift current were negligible, there would be no significant current flow under the applied voltage in this model.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    This statement correctly identifies all the key assumptions:\n    *   \"trap-free\": Correct.\n    *   \"single-carrier device\": Correct.\n    *   \"no carrier injection barrier\": Correct. This is the definition of the required ideal Ohmic contact.\n    *   \"negligible diffusion current\": Correct, implying the current is drift-dominated.\n    This statement is fully consistent with the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney law.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    This statement is incorrect because the model is derived specifically for a single-carrier device. The presence of a second carrier type would fundamentally change the physics and the resulting current-voltage relationship.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete statement is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
