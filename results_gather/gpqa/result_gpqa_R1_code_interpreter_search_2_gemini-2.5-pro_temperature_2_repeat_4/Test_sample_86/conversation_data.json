    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two groups attached to it. These groups can be in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions relative to each other. The ring itself contributes 4 protons to the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\":** The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\":** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\":** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I, let's denote it as -X) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose Plausible Chemical Structures**\n\nBased on the information above, we can assemble the molecule:\n*   We have a halogen (-X) on the ring.\n*   The other substituent must contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nThere are two primary possibilities for the second substituent:\n*   **An acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The C=O is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n*   **A formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO):** This is an aldehyde group attached via a methylene (-CH₂) linker. It also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nThis gives us two potential base structures:\n*   **Structure 1: Haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)**\n*   **Structure 2: Halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)**\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Options and Compare with Predicted Spectra**\n\nNow let's examine the patterns in the given NMR options. Options B and D both show a characteristic pattern for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring: two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This symmetry arises when the two substituents are on opposite sides of the ring. Options A and C do not fit a simple di-substituted benzene ring. So we can focus on B and D, assuming the compound is para-substituted.\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for p-Haloacetophenone (Structure 1):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄):** The -COCH₃ group and the -X group are both electron-withdrawing. This will shift the 4 aromatic protons downfield (to a higher ppm value, typically > 7.0 ppm). The para-substitution will create a symmetric pattern of two doublets (2H each).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** There are no adjacent protons, so this will be a singlet integrating to 3H. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Expected Pattern:** (2H, d), (2H, d), (3H, s).\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for p-Halophenylacetaldehyde (Structure 2):**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This proton is highly characteristic and appears far downfield as a singlet (or a small triplet), typically between 9.5-10.5 ppm.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂-):** These two protons are adjacent to the ring and the aldehyde group. They will appear as a singlet (if coupling to the CHO proton is negligible) or a doublet. The typical chemical shift is around 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄):** We would again expect two doublets (2H each) for the 4 aromatic protons.\n\n**4. Evaluate Options B and D against Predictions**\n\n*   **Option B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the **predicted pattern for p-haloacetophenone**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` represent the four aromatic protons in a para-substituted system. The downfield shifts are consistent with two electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is a perfect match for the methyl group of an acetyl substituent.\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the **predicted pattern for p-halophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   `9.9 (1H, s)` is a classic aldehyde proton.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` represent the aromatic protons.\n    *   `3.7 (2H, s)` represents the methylene (-CH₂-) protons.\n\n**5. Distinguish Between Plausible Options using Chemical Shift Theory**\n\nWe have two options (B and D) that seem plausible based on signal patterns. We must use a more detailed analysis of the chemical shifts to decide. The key difference lies in the electronic effect of the -COCH₃ group versus the -CH₂CHO group on the aromatic ring.\n\n*   In p-haloacetophenone (Structure 1), the carbonyl of the acetyl group is directly conjugated with the aromatic ring. This makes it a **strong electron-withdrawing and deshielding group**. It strongly pulls electron density from the ring, shifting the aromatic protons significantly downfield. Chemical shifts of **7.6-7.9 ppm** are very typical for this structure (e.g., for p-bromoacetophenone).\n*   In p-halophenylacetaldehyde (Structure 2), the carbonyl is separated from the ring by a -CH₂- group. This insulation prevents direct conjugation. The -CH₂CHO group is only weakly electron-withdrawing. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be much less deshielded, with expected shifts closer to **7.2-7.4 ppm**.\n\nComparing this with the options:\n*   The aromatic shifts in **Option B (7.8 and 7.6 ppm)** are consistent with the strong deshielding of the conjugated -COCH₃ group.\n*   The aromatic shifts in **Option D (7.8 and 7.6 ppm)** are too far downfield for a ring substituted with a -CH₂CHO group.\n\nTherefore, the compound must be p-haloacetophenone, and the correct NMR data is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
