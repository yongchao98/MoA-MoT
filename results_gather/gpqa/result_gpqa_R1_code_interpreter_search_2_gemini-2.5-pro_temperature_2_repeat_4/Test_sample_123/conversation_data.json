    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation and particle decay.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after a certain time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-t_proper / τ)\n    where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame), and `t_proper` is the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The time elapsed in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time, `t_proper`, by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    t_lab = γ * t_proper  =>  t_proper = t_lab / γ\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab`. The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) at an \"ultra-relativistic\" velocity `v`, which is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n4.  **Combining the Equations:** We can substitute the expressions for `t_proper` and `t_lab` into the decay law:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-( (R/c) / γ ) / τ) = exp( -R / (γ * c * τ) )\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for a given particle type and detector size. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    N/N₀ = exp( -K / γ )\n\n5.  **Applying the Given Conditions:**\n    *   **Condition 1:** When γ₁ = 20, the survival fraction (N/N₀)₁ = 1/3.\n        1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n    *   **Condition 2:** We want to find the Lorentz factor γ₂ for which the survival fraction (N/N₀)₂ = 2/3.\n        2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n\n6.  **Solving for γ₂:**\n    First, let's find the constant `K` from Condition 1. Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    Now, use this value of `K` in the equation for Condition 2. Take the natural logarithm:\n    ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n    ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    Now, solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)\n    γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\n7.  **Calculation:** We can now compute the numerical value of γ₂.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate gamma_2 based on the derived formula\n# gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.1884022204764\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation shows that the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this to the given options, the closest answer is 54.\n\nA) 68\nB) 54\nC) 40\nD) 28\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Initial Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Particle Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial population `N₀` after a time `t_proper` in their own rest frame is governed by the exponential decay law: `N/N₀ = exp(-t_proper / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the laboratory's frame of reference, the particle's internal clock appears to run slower due to time dilation. The time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_proper`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_proper`, or `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R = 30 m` in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n4.  **Combined Survival Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t_proper` and `t_lab` into the decay equation, we get the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    N/N₀ = exp( -( (R/c) / γ ) / τ ) = exp( -R / (γ * c * τ) )\n\n**Applying the Given Data:**\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n    *   Survival fraction, (N/N₀)₁ = 1/3\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-R / (20 * c * τ))`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   We need to find the Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n    *   Survival fraction, (N/N₀)₂ = 2/3\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation:\n        `2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\n**Solving for γ₂:**\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's solve for it using the information from Scenario 1.\n\n1.  Take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 1:\n    `ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -R / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `R / (c * τ) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n2.  Now, take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n3.  Substitute the expression for `R / (c * τ)` that we found in step 1 into the equation from step 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n4.  Now, we solve for γ₂:\n    `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nUsing the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n`γ₂ = 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe python code executed previously confirms this calculation, giving a result of ~54.2.\n\nComparing our calculated value of ~54.2 with the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 54\nC) 40\nD) 28\n\nThe closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
