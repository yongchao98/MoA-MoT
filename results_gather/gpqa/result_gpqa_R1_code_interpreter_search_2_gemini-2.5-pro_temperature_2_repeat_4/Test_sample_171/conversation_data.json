    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** Two stars, star_1 and star_2.\n    *   **Assumption:** The photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a key piece of information, as it allows the use of statistical mechanics equations like the Boltzmann and Saha equations. For excitation of atoms, the Boltzmann equation is the relevant tool.\n    *   **Observation:** Iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This relates the population of a specific excited energy level in the two stars.\n    *   **Given Value:** The energy difference (ΔE) between the ground state and the excited state is ~1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars (T₁ and T₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physics Principle:**\n    The relative population of two energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n\n    Where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the excited state (energy E₂) and a lower state (energy E₁), respectively.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of these levels.\n    *   E₂ - E₁ = ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature of the system.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle to the Stars:**\n    Let's define the ratio of excited atoms to atoms in a lower state as *R*.\n    *   R = N_excited / N_lower_state\n\n    Applying the Boltzmann equation to each star:\n    *   For star_1 (temperature T₁):  R₁ = (g_excited / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   For star_2 (temperature T₂):  R₂ = (g_excited / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n4.  **Incorporate the \"Twice as Excited\" Condition:**\n    The problem states that star_1 is \"twice as excited\" as star_2. This means the ratio *R* for star_1 is two times the ratio *R* for star_2.\n    *   R₁ = 2 * R₂\n\n5.  **Set Up the Equation and Simplify:**\n    Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition R₁ = 2 * R₂:\n\n    (g_excited / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [ (g_excited / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\n    The statistical weight term `(g_excited / g_lower)` is the same for both stars because we are considering the same atomic transition in iron. Therefore, it cancels out from both sides:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperature Relationship:**\n    To solve for T₁ and T₂, I need to get them out of the exponents. The natural logarithm (ln) is the tool for this.\n\n    Take the natural log of both sides:\n    ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] = ln[ 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\n    Using the log rule `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\n    Since `ln(exp(x)) = x`:\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\n    Now, I want to isolate `ln(2)` as it appears on the left side of all the options:\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\n7.  **Final Algebraic Manipulation:**\n    Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parentheses by finding a common denominator (T₁ * T₂):\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ / (T₁*T₂)) - (T₂ / (T₁*T₂)) ]\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n8.  **Incorporate the Given Numerical Values:**\n    The problem provides ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    The value of the Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n    The ratio ΔE / k is therefore:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    Substituting this back into the equation:\n    ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n    ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] --- Incorrect denominator.\n    *   B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] --- Incorrect numerator.\n    *   C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] --- **This matches my derived result.**\n    *   D) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] --- Incorrect form.\n\nThe correct equation is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
