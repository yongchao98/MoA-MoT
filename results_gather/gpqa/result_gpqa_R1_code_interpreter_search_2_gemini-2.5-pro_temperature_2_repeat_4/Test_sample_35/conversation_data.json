    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The user is providing information about an observation of a very distant astronomical object and asking what kind of medium in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, would produce a similar *type* of absorption line.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   Distance of the object: `d = 2.1 Gpc` (Gigaparsecs)\n    *   Observed energy of the absorption line: `E_obs = 3.9 * 10^-6 eV` (micro-electron volts)\n\n3.  **Recognize the Core Physics Principle:** Light from distant objects is stretched by the expansion of the universe. This phenomenon is called cosmological redshift (`z`). The observed energy (`E_obs`) is lower than the energy when it was emitted (`E_rest`). The relationship is `E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)`. To identify the transition, we need to find its rest-frame energy.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    a.  Calculate the redshift (`z`) from the given distance (`d`). The Hubble-Lemaître law relates recession velocity (`v`), distance (`d`), and the Hubble constant (`H_0`): `v = H_0 * d`. For cosmological distances, redshift is a more direct measure of this expansion. The simplified relationship for non-relativistic speeds is `z = v/c = (H_0 * d) / c`, where `c` is the speed of light. This approximation is generally good enough for initial estimates.\n    b.  Use the calculated redshift (`z`) to find the rest-frame energy (`E_rest`) of the absorption line.\n    c.  Calculate the wavelength (`λ_rest`) corresponding to this rest-frame energy using the Planck-Einstein relation `E = hf = hc/λ`, which can be rearranged to `λ = hc/E`.\n    d.  Identify the atomic or molecular transition that corresponds to this wavelength/energy.\n    e.  Determine the type of interstellar medium in the Milky Way where this transition is typically observed in absorption.\n    f.  Compare the result with the given multiple-choice options.\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan (Step-by-Step Calculation):**\n\n    *   **Step a: Calculate Redshift (z)**\n        *   We need the Hubble constant, `H_0`. A commonly used value is approximately `70 km/s/Mpc`.\n        *   We need the speed of light, `c`. Approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n        *   Convert the distance `d` to Megaparsecs (Mpc): `2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc`.\n        *   Calculate `z`: `z = (H_0 * d) / c = (70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc) / 300,000 km/s = 147,000 / 300,000 = 0.49`.\n\n    *   **Step b: Calculate Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest)**\n        *   `E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)`\n        *   `E_rest = (3.9 * 10^-6 eV) * (1 + 0.49)`\n        *   `E_rest = (3.9 * 10^-6 eV) * 1.49 ≈ 5.811 * 10^-6 eV`.\n\n    *   **Step c: Calculate Rest-Frame Wavelength (λ_rest)**\n        *   We use the constant `hc` (Planck's constant times the speed of light), which is conveniently `~1240 eV·nm` or `1.24 * 10^-6 eV·m`.\n        *   `λ_rest = hc / E_rest`\n        *   `λ_rest = (1.24 * 10^-6 eV·m) / (5.811 * 10^-6 eV) ≈ 0.213 meters`.\n        *   Convert to centimeters: `0.213 m = 21.3 cm`.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Result:**\n\n    *   **Step d & e: Identify the Transition and Medium:** A wavelength of about 21 cm is extremely famous in astronomy. It is the wavelength of the **hyperfine transition** (or \"spin-flip\" transition) of neutral atomic hydrogen (denoted as **H I**).\n    *   This transition occurs when the spin of the electron and the spin of the proton in a hydrogen atom flip relative to each other.\n    *   This H I line can be seen in both emission and absorption. Emission typically traces widespread, warmer neutral gas. However, sharp, distinct *absorption* lines, like the one detected, are characteristic signatures of **cold atomic gas** (the Cold Neutral Medium, or CNM, with temperatures around 50-100 K) located between us and a bright background radio source. The cold gas absorbs the radio waves from the source at precisely this 21 cm wavelength.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) Warm molecular interstellar medium: Incorrect. The transition is from atomic hydrogen, not molecular, and absorption is characteristic of cold, not warm, gas.\n    *   B) Cold atomic interstellar medium: Correct. This corresponds to the H I 21-cm absorption line from the Cold Neutral Medium.\n    *   C) Warm atomic interstellar medium: Incorrect. While this medium contains atomic hydrogen, it typically produces broad emission lines, not narrow absorption lines.\n    *   D) Cold molecular interstellar medium: Incorrect. The transition is atomic, not molecular. Molecular clouds (like those containing CO) are observed at different (typically millimeter) wavelengths.\n\n8.  **Final Confirmation:** The calculation reliably points to the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen. In our own galaxy, observing this line in absorption is a primary method for detecting the cold atomic interstellar medium. The entire reasoning is self-consistent.

    "An absorption line observed from a distant source must be corrected for cosmological redshift to determine its rest-frame energy and wavelength, which allows for its identification.\n\n1.  **Calculate Redshift (z):** The distance to the source is given as 2.1 Gpc. We can use the Hubble-Lemaître law, v = H₀ * d, and the relativistic Doppler formula z = v/c to estimate the redshift.\n    *   Distance (d) = 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc.\n    *   Hubble Constant (H₀) ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc.\n    *   Speed of Light (c) ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n    *   Recession velocity (v) = 70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s.\n    *   Redshift (z) = v/c = 147,000 / 300,000 = 0.49.\n\n2.  **Calculate Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest):** The observed energy (E_obs) is redshifted. The rest-frame energy is found using the formula E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z).\n    *   E_obs = 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV.\n    *   E_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49) = 5.811 * 10⁻⁶ eV.\n\n3.  **Calculate Rest-Frame Wavelength (λ_rest):** We can convert this energy to a wavelength using the Planck-Einstein relation, λ = hc/E.\n    *   The constant hc ≈ 1.24 x 10⁻⁶ eV·m.\n    *   λ_rest = (1.24 x 10⁻⁶ eV·m) / (5.811 * 10⁻⁶ eV) ≈ 0.213 m.\n    *   Converting to centimeters: 0.213 m = 21.3 cm.\n\n4.  **Identify the Transition:** A wavelength of approximately 21 cm is the signature of the hyperfine \"spin-flip\" transition of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I). This is one of the most important spectral lines in radio astronomy.\n\n5.  **Identify the Medium:** In our own galaxy, the Milky Way, the H I 21-cm line is observed in both emission and absorption. Broad emission profiles trace the widespread warm atomic gas. However, sharp, narrow absorption lines are characteristic of cold, dense clouds of atomic hydrogen situated between us and a bright background radio source. Therefore, this absorption line is a tracer of the **cold atomic interstellar medium**.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the options:\n*   A) Warm molecular interstellar medium: Incorrect. The transition is atomic, and absorption traces cold gas.\n*   B) Cold atomic interstellar medium: Correct. This corresponds to the H I 21-cm absorption.\n*   C) Warm atomic interstellar medium: Incorrect. This medium is typically seen in emission, not absorption.\n*   D) Cold molecular interstellar medium: Incorrect. The transition is atomic, not molecular.\n\n<<<B>>>"
