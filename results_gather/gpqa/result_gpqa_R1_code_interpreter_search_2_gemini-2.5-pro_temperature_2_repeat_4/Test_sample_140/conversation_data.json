    "This question involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This set of reactants and conditions is characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction mechanism:\n\n**Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts an acidic proton from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nBecause the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, the abstraction of the proton from C6 is kinetically favored (a phenomenon known as the primary kinetic isotope effect). However, abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is also possible, albeit at a slower rate. Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6 (Major Pathway)**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  The result is the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2 (Minor Pathway)**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron from C2.\n    2.  This forms a carbanion that expels the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this process, this intermediate is the standard, undeuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Addition of the Nucleophile to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), now attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuteriobenzyne)**\n    The 3-deuteriobenzyne intermediate is asymmetric. The NH₂⁻ nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products:\n    1.  **Attack at C1**: The NH₂ group adds to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated by NH₃. The product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6**: The NH₂ group adds to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. When we re-number the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest possible number (position 1), the deuterium atom is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    Therefore, Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n*   **Product from Pathway B (via standard benzyne)**\n    The benzyne intermediate formed here is symmetric and has no deuterium. Attack by NH₂⁻ can occur at C1 or C2, but since the molecule is symmetric, both attacks lead to the same product after protonation.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2**: The product formed is regular, undeuterated **aniline**.\n\n    Therefore, Pathway B yields one product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find that three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products in total.\n\n<<<B>>>"
