    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands: Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV).\n    *   **Hypothetical Scenario:** The pp-III branch of solar fusion stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. This is the crucial information, as it means the effects are now observable on Earth. All other fusion reactions (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) continue as normal.\n    *   **Irrelevant Information:** Neutrino flavor changes (oscillations) are explicitly stated not to play a role in this ratio.\n\n2.  **Identify the Sources of Solar Neutrinos by Energy:**\n    I need to know which nuclear reactions in the Sun produce neutrinos and what their energy spectra are. This will allow me to determine which sources contribute to the specified energy bands.\n\n    *   **pp-I Chain:**\n        *   `p + p → d + e⁺ + νe` (`pp` neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to 420 keV. **This is below both bands.**\n    *   **pp-II Chain:**\n        *   `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe` (`⁷Be` neutrinos): This reaction produces monoenergetic (single-energy) neutrinos. The vast majority (90%) are at 0.861 MeV, which is **861 keV**. A smaller fraction (10%) is at 384 keV. The 861 keV line falls squarely within **band 2 (800-900 keV)**. This branch is unaffected by the problem's condition.\n    *   **pp-III Chain:**\n        *   `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe` (`⁸B` neutrinos): This reaction produces a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos, up to about 15 MeV. These neutrinos contribute to a wide range of energies, including **both band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV)**. Crucially, the problem states **this branch has stopped**.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:**\n        *   Neutrinos from `¹³N` decay (up to 1.20 MeV) and `¹⁵O` decay (up to 1.73 MeV) also produce a continuous spectrum that contributes to both energy bands. The CNO cycle is a very minor contributor to energy and neutrino production in the Sun compared to the pp chain. This branch is unaffected.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Neutrino Flux *After* the pp-III Branch Stops:**\n\n    Let's evaluate the composition of each energy band based on the hypothetical scenario:\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos? **NO**, this source has been turned off.\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos? **NO**, its main line is at 861 keV, outside this band.\n        *   `CNO` neutrinos? **YES**, a small number from the tail of their spectra fall into this band.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only remaining source is the very low flux from the CNO cycle. The flux is therefore very, very small, close to zero.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos? **NO**, this source has been turned off.\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos? **YES**, this branch is still active, and it produces a very strong, dominant peak of neutrinos at 861 keV.\n        *   `CNO` neutrinos? **YES**, a small number also contribute to this band.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is completely dominated by the very strong `⁷Be` line at 861 keV.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n\n    *   **Flux (Band 1)** ≈ Flux from CNO ≈ very, very small.\n    *   **Flux (Band 2)** ≈ Flux from `⁷Be` + Flux from CNO ≈ very large (dominated by `⁷Be`).\n\n    The ratio is therefore:\n    Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ (very, very small) / (very large)\n\n    This ratio will be a very small number, much less than 1.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   A) 1: Incorrect. The fluxes are vastly different.\n    *   B) 0.1 (10⁻¹): A small number.\n    *   C) 0.01 (10⁻²): An even smaller number.\n    *   D) 10: Incorrect. The ratio is less than 1.\n\n    The question now is *how* small. The `⁷Be` neutrino flux is the second largest of all solar neutrino sources (after the primary `pp` neutrinos), while the CNO cycle fluxes are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Since Band 1 only has the CNO contribution and Band 2 is dominated by the massive `⁷Be` flux, the ratio will be roughly on the order of the ratio of the total CNO flux to the `⁷Be` flux.\n\n    Let's look up the standard flux values:\n    *   Flux(`⁷Be` at 861 keV) ≈ 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / cm² / s\n    *   Flux(`¹³N` + `¹⁵O`) ≈ (3 + 2) x 10⁸ neutrinos / cm² / s = 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / cm² / s\n\n    Even a rough comparison of the total fluxes shows the CNO contribution is about 1/10th of the `⁷Be` contribution. However, we are only looking at a narrow energy window (100 keV wide). The `⁷Be` source concentrates almost all its flux in a single line within Band 2, whereas the CNO flux is spread out over a much wider energy range (~1.7 MeV). Therefore, the fraction of CNO flux that actually falls into Band 1 is only a small part of its total. This will make the numerator (Flux Band 1) much smaller than the total CNO flux. The denominator (Flux Band 2) is almost entirely the total `⁷Be` flux.\n\n    The ratio will be significantly smaller than 0.1. A value of 0.01 is a much more reasonable approximation for (small fraction of CNO flux) / (`⁷Be` flux).\n\n<<<C>>>"
