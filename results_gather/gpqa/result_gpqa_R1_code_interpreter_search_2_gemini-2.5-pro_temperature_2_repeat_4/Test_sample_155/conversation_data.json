    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a two-step process for the **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene. The first step, reaction with mCPBA (a peroxyacid), forms an epoxide. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring opening with water, opens the epoxide to form a diol. The overall stereochemistry of this sequence is *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the double bond.\n*   **Starting Material Stereochemistry:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A standard rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso compound**. This can be remembered by the mnemonic \"TAM\": **T**rans + **A**nti = **M**eso.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters. Let's label this product **M**.\n    *   The specific stereochemistry is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is identical to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol due to the molecule's symmetry).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**, same as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Starting Material Stereochemistry:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for *cis*-alkenes is that *anti*-addition of two identical groups results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. This can be remembered by the mnemonic \"TAR\": Trans-addition (**A**nti) on a **C**is-alkene gives a **R**acemic mixture.\n*   **Products of Reaction 2:** The products are a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n    *   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (Let's label this **R**)\n    *   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (Let's label this **S**)\n    *   **R** and **S** are enantiomers.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Products\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n2.  **R** ((4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 2.\n3.  **S** ((4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 2.\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   **R** and **S** are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of both **R** and **S**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Mixture with Standard (Achiral) HPLC\n\n*   **Principle:** Standard High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) uses an achiral stationary phase. An achiral environment cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties (including retention time) on an achiral column. However, diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The enantiomers **R** and **S** will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound **M** is a diastereomer of **R** and **S**, so it will have a different retention time and will elute as a separate peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Mixture with Chiral HPLC\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment interacts differently with each enantiomer, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The enantiomers **R** and **S** will have different retention times and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound **M**, being a diastereomer of **R** and **S**, will also have a unique retention time and will elute as its own peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram (one for **M**, one for **R**, and one for **S**).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Standard (achiral) HPLC: **2 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **3 peaks**\n\nThis outcome corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
