    "An analysis of the user's query is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts.\n2.  Calculate the total energy of the system, which consists of the two astronauts.\n\nHere's the step-by-step derivation:\n### Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (`v_rel`)\n\nThe velocities are relativistic, so we must use the formula for relativistic velocity subtraction. The relative velocity of astronaut 2 (with velocity `v2`) with respect to astronaut 1 (with velocity `v1`) is given by:\n\n`v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3 * c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = -(1/7)c`\n\nThe question asks for the relative speed, which is the magnitude of the relative velocity.\n`|v_rel| = (1/7)c`\n\nTo express this as a decimal:\n`|v_rel| ≈ 0.142857 c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `v_rel = 0.14c`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy (`E`)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\n\n`E_total = E1 + E2 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 + γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n\n**For astronaut 1:**\n*   `m1 = 2m`\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**For astronaut 2:**\n*   `m2 = 3m`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n*   `E2 = (1 / sqrt(0.75)) * (3m) * c^2`\n\n**Total Energy:**\n`E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc^2 + (1 / sqrt(0.75)) * 3mc^2`\n`E_total = [2.5 + 3 / sqrt(0.75)] mc^2`\n\nNow we will use a python script to get a numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part 1: Relative velocity\nv1 = 0.6\nv2 = 0.5\nv_rel_numerator = v2 - v1\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - v1 * v2\nv_rel_magnitude = abs(v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator)\nprint(f\"Relative speed: {v_rel_magnitude:.3f}c\")\n\n# Part 2: Total Energy\n# Astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\nE1_coeff = gamma1 * 2  # E1 = (gamma1 * 2m) * c^2\n\n# Astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\nE2_coeff = gamma2 * 3  # E2 = (gamma2 * 3m) * c^2\n\n# Total energy\nE_total_coeff = E1_coeff + E2_coeff\nprint(f\"Total energy coefficient: {E_total_coeff:.3f}\")\n```\nThe python code above confirms our calculations.\n\n`Relative speed = 0.143c ≈ 0.14c`\n`Total Energy = 5.964mc^2 ≈ 5.96mc^2`\n\nThe results match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

    "The relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system are calculated using the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Relative Speed (`v_rel`)\n\nSince the speeds are relativistic, we use the Einstein velocity subtraction formula for objects moving in the same direction. The relative velocity of astronaut 2 (velocity `v2`) as observed by astronaut 1 (velocity `v1`) is:\n\n`v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (-0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = -(1/7)c ≈ -0.1428c`\n\nThe question asks for the relative *speed*, which is the magnitude of the relative velocity.\n`|v_rel| ≈ 0.14c`\n\n### 2. Calculation of Total Energy (`E`)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`. The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\n\n`E_total = E1 + E2 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 + γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n\n**For the first astronaut:**\n*   Mass `m1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Energy `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5mc^2`\n\n**For the second astronaut:**\n*   Mass `m2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Energy `E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc^2 ≈ 3.464mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy:**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2`\n*   `E_total = 5.964mc^2`\n\nRounding the total energy to two decimal places gives `5.96mc^2`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe relative speed is approximately `0.14c`, and the total energy of the system is approximately `5.96mc^2`.
