    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4R1R2) contains 4 aromatic hydrogen atoms. The \"two signals\" arise because the protons are not all chemically equivalent, which is expected when the two substituents are different. So, we have **4 aromatic hydrogens**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H\". This means there are two distinct protons on a carbon-carbon double bond. So, we have **2 vinyl hydrogens**.\n    *   **–CH3 groups:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". This means there are two distinct methyl groups. Each methyl group (–CH3) has 3 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the total number of methyl hydrogens is 2 * 3 = **6 methyl hydrogens**.\n    *   **–CH2 groups:** The problem explicitly states there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". This means there are **0 methylene hydrogens**.\n\n    *   **Total Hydrogen Count:** Summing up all the hydrogens: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = **12 hydrogens**.\n\n2.  **Narrow Down the Options:**\n    The total hydrogen count is 12. Let's look at the given options:\n    A) C12H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    B) C11H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    C) C12H14O2 (14 H) - Eliminated\n    D) C11H14O2 (14 H) - Eliminated\n\n    We are now left with options A and B. The task is to determine if the molecule has 11 or 12 carbon atoms.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Fragments to Determine the Number of Carbon Atoms:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A \"6-membered aromatic ring\" is a benzene ring, which contains **6 carbons**.\n    *   **Ester Group and Associated Alkyl Groups:**\n        *   The FTIR shows an ester group (R-COO-R'). An ester contains a carbonyl carbon (C=O). So that's **1 carbon**.\n        *   The NMR shows two -CH3 signals and no -CH2 signals. One of these methyl groups must belong to the ester, making it a methyl ester (-COOCH3). An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) is ruled out by the \"no -CH2-\" rule. This methyl ester group contributes the carbonyl carbon and a methyl carbon. So, the `-COOCH3` fragment accounts for **2 carbons** and one of the methyl signals.\n    *   **Second Substituent:**\n        *   We still need to account for the two vinyl protons and the second methyl group. The specific NMR splitting patterns give a crucial clue: \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" for the vinyl protons. This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, `-CHa=CHb-CH3`.\n            *   Proton `Ha` would be split by `Hb` into a doublet.\n            *   Proton `Hb` would be split by `Ha` (doublet) and the adjacent `-CH3` group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and the second methyl group. It contains **3 carbons**. It also contains no -CH2- groups, consistent with the data.\n\n4.  **Sum the Carbon Atoms:**\n    Let's add up the carbons from the identified pieces:\n    *   Benzene ring: 6 C\n    *   Methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 2 C\n    *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 C\n    *   **Total Carbon Count:** 6 + 2 + 3 = **11 carbons**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The analysis shows the molecule contains 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms (from the ester group). The molecular formula is therefore **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B. The deduced structure is a methyl propenylbenzoate isomer (e.g., methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate), which fits all spectral data perfectly.\n\n```python\n# This script formalizes the reasoning process for determining the molecular formula.\n\ndef deduce_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Deduces the molecular formula based on spectroscopic data by summing up the atoms from identified fragments.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
