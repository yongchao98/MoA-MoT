    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states.**\n    *   The initial state of the 2-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n        *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1 (p orbital).\n        *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2 (p orbital).\n        *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n        *   $m = -1$: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n    *   The question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome. We are measuring the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n    *   For a particle with orbital angular momentum quantum number $l_i$, the eigenvalues of the $L_{iz}$ operator are $m_{li} \\hbar$.\n    *   The outcome $L_{1z} \\rightarrow -\\hbar$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The outcome $L_{2z} \\rightarrow -\\hbar$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is described in the uncoupled basis as $|\\psi_{final}> = |l_1, m_{l1}> \\otimes |l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1> \\otimes |1, -1>$. For simplicity, we can write this as $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n2.  **Relate the coupled and uncoupled bases.**\n    The relationship between the coupled state $|l, m>$ and the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ is given by the Clebsch-Gordan expansion:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} <l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m> |m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$\n    Here, $<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    A fundamental property of the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component is conserved. The total z-component of angular momentum operator is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    When acting on a coupled state, $L_z |l, m> = m\\hbar |l, m>$.\n    When acting on an uncoupled state, $L_z |m_{l1}, m_{l2}> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z})|m_{l1}, m_{l2}> = (m_{l1}\\hbar + m_{l2}\\hbar)|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$.\n    For the Clebsch-Gordan expansion to be non-zero, the eigenvalue of the total $L_z$ operator must be the same. This implies a crucial selection rule:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>$ is zero unless this condition is met.\n\n4.  **Check the condition for the given problem.**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   The final state we are interested in is $|-1, -1>$, which means $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is satisfied.\n    *   $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We see that $-2 \\neq -1$. The required sum of the individual z-components (-2) does not equal the total z-component of the initial state (-1).\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|\\psi_{final}>$ when it is initially in the state $|\\psi_{initial}>$ is given by the squared magnitude of their inner product:\n    $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2$.\n    $P = |< -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 >|^2$.\n    The inner product $< -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 >$ is just the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$.\n    Because the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not satisfied, this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$.\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    In simpler terms, since the z-component of the total angular momentum must be conserved, it is impossible for a system with a total $m=-1$ to be found in a state where the sum of its parts is $m_{l1}+m_{l2} = -2$. The measurement must yield a combination of $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ that sums to -1 (in this case, either $m_{l1}=0, m_{l2}=-1$ or $m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=0$). The outcome $m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1$ is forbidden by the conservation law.\n\n<<<A>>>"
