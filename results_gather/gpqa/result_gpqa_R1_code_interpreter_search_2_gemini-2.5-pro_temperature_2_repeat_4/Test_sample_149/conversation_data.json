    "**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the starting material (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. So, DBE = 8 - 9/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5. A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a substituted benzene ring (DBE=4) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a double bond or a ring). The C=O bond of an aldehyde accounts for this extra degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **NMR Data Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it is coupled to a neighboring methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8 ppm), both integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield from benzene (7.26 ppm), indicating the presence of at least one strong electron-donating group (EDG).\n        *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This is characteristic of an amine (-NH2) group attached to the aromatic ring. The -NH2 group is a strong EDG, which explains the upfield shifts of the aromatic protons.\n        *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** This is a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet splitting means it is coupled to a single proton (-CH-), which is consistent with the adjacent aldehyde proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment is attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Putting it all together:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO group. The molecular formula C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) is C8H9NO, which matches the given formula.\n    *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n    *   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** These reagents are used to convert a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   4-aminophenylacetaldehyde → 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride.\n    *   **Reagent 2: H2O (Hydrolysis):** Adding water to the diazonium salt (often with gentle heating) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas.\n        *   4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride → **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation):** This provides a strong base and heat. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the conditions for a self-aldol condensation reaction.\n        *   **Step a: Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        *   **Step b: Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        *   **Step c: Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n        *   **Step d: Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" is a crucial detail. It promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product to form a more stable, conjugated system. The proton on the carbon alpha to the aldehyde (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group from C3 leaves. This creates a double bond between C2 and C3. The resulting α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings, making it very stable.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final Product.**\n    *   The aldol addition product is:\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n        (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal)\n    *   Upon heating, this dehydrates to:\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n    *   Let's name this final product using IUPAC rules. The main chain is a butenal. The double bond starts at C2. The substituents are a `(4-hydroxyphenyl)` group at C2 and a `(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl` group attached to C4, but we can see from the reaction that there are two identical phenyl-OH units. Let's redraw the structure more carefully from the reaction:\n        Nucleophile: `[HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]`-\n        Electrophile: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO`\n        Addition product: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-C6H4-OH`. (This is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal).\n        Dehydration product: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(CHO)-C6H4-OH`. (This is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal).\n    *   This name matches option **A**.\n\nThe final product after the full sequence including heating is the dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n\n*   A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the final dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents (no -OH) and wrong structure.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product, formed before the heat-induced dehydration step.\n\nTherefore, the final product is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
