    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumption:** We are told to assume that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it 'n', is constant everywhere. The number of stars (N) in any given volume (V) is simply N = n * V.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars vs. Distance:** Let's consider a sphere of radius 'd' centered on Earth.\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V(d) = (4/3) * π * d^3`.\n    *   The total number of stars `N(d)` within this distance 'd' is `N(d) = n * V(d) = n * (4/3) * π * d^3`.\n    *   This shows that the total number of stars up to a certain distance is proportional to the cube of that distance: `N(d) ∝ d^3`.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:** We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range* of a variable. It's often easier to first think about the number of stars in a small, finite range. Let's find the number of stars `dN` located in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell `dV` can be found by differentiating the volume formula with respect to `d`: `dV = (d/dd V(d)) * dd = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `n` times the shell's volume `dV`: `dN = n * dV = n * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n    *   So, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `d` is proportional to `d^2 * dd`.\n\n4.  **Introducing Parallax:** The question asks for the relationship with parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). The relationship between parallax and distance is inverse:\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   This also means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n5.  **Converting the Differential:** We need to relate the differential distance `dd` to the differential parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    *   `dd / d(plx) = -1 / plx^2`\n    *   Therefore, `dd = - (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`.\n    *   When we are counting stars, we are concerned with the magnitude of the range, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as `d` increases, `plx` decreases). So we'll use `dd = (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Putting It All Together:** Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for the number of stars in a shell (`dN`).\n    *   Original equation: `dN = n * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = n * 4 * π * (1/plx)^2 * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`: `dN = n * 4 * π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify: `dN = n * 4 * π * (1/plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Final Result:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\". This is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   From our final equation in step 6, we can divide by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = n * 4 * π * (1/plx^4)`\n    *   Since `n`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, the relationship is:\n    *   **Number of stars per unit parallax ∝ 1/plx^4**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
