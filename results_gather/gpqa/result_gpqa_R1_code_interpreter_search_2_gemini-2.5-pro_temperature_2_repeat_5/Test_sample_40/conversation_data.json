    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** This problem involves the addition of velocities in the context of special relativity. We cannot simply add the velocities arithmetically (i.e., `v_observed = v_light_in_glass + v_glass`) because the speeds are significant fractions of the speed of light. We must use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n2.  **Define the frames of reference:**\n    *   **S Frame:** The stationary laboratory frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **S' Frame:** The moving frame of reference, which is the glass itself. It moves with a velocity `v` relative to the S frame.\n\n3.  **Identify the velocities involved:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the S' frame (the glass) relative to the S frame (the laboratory). The problem states this is `v`.\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured in the S' frame (i.e., relative to the glass). This is the standard speed of light in a stationary medium. By definition, the index of refraction `n` is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`. The problem states we should take `c = 1`. Therefore, `n = 1 / u'`, which means `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured in the S frame (the laboratory). This is the value we need to find.\n\n4.  **Apply the Lorentz transformation for velocities (Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula):**\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the algebraic expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The calculated speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n\n    *   A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   D) 1\n\n    Our result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
