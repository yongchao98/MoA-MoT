    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) is considered the stationary frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S') is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured by a clock at rest in its own frame (the ejecta's frame), this is the \"proper time,\" `Δt₀`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Physics:**\n    *   The distance traveled in any frame is the velocity in that frame multiplied by the time elapsed in that frame. In the Galaxy's frame S, the formula is:\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame S.\n\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation in special relativity, a clock that is moving relative to an observer will be measured to tick slower than a clock that is at rest in the observer's own frame. The time interval measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) measured in the moving frame by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ` is defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n        `d = v * Δt = v * γ * Δt₀`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    To get a precise value, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_ejecta = 50  # s, this is the proper time (Δt₀)\n\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 299792.458 # Using a more precise value, but 300000 is usually sufficient\n# However, for this problem, the ratio v/c=0.2 seems intended, so we stick with c=300000 km/s\nc = 300000\n\n# Calculate the non-relativistic distance first for comparison\nd_non_relativistic = v * dt_ejecta\n# print(f\"Non-relativistic distance: {d_non_relativistic} km\")\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt)\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_ejecta\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame (d)\ndistance_galaxy = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"Distance in Galaxy frame: {distance_galaxy:.2f} km\")\n\n# Let's also calculate the distance using the binomial approximation for gamma\n# γ ≈ 1 + 0.5 * β²\ngamma_approx = 1 + 0.5 * beta**2\ndistance_approx = v * gamma_approx * dt_ejecta\n# print(f\"Approximated distance: {distance_approx} km\")\n\n```\n<execute_result>\nDistance in Galaxy frame: 3061862.18 km\n</execute_result>\nThe precise calculation gives `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer, `v * Δt₀`)\nB) 2,940,000 km\nC) 3,060,000 km\nD) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is very close to option C. The small difference is likely due to the options being rounded or based on an approximation. Let's check the result using the binomial approximation `γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)β²`, which is valid for small `β`.\n`γ ≈ 1 + 0.5 * (0.2)² = 1 + 0.5 * 0.04 = 1.02`\n`d ≈ 1.02 * (v * Δt₀) = 1.02 * 3,000,000 km = 3,060,000 km`.\nThis matches option C exactly, confirming it is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame. To solve this, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the physics and calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **The Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we are observing the ejecta.\n    *   **The Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The problem states that 50 seconds pass in this frame. This is the **proper time** (`Δt₀`), as it's the time measured by a clock at rest in the moving frame.\n\n2.  **List Given Values:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v` = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   Proper time (in the ejecta's frame), `Δt₀` = 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light, `c` ≈ 300,000 km/s (a standard approximation, which works perfectly here).\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   Find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S). The formula for this distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving frame (the ejecta). This effect is called time dilation.\n    *   The relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) is given by the formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio `v/c` (also known as `β`).**\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor, `γ`.**\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n        So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy sees about 51.03 seconds pass.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic distance, `v * Δt₀`).\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km.\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km.\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km.\n\nOur calculated value `3,061,862 km` is very close to option C. The slight difference is because the options are likely rounded or calculated using a binomial approximation of the Lorentz factor (`γ ≈ 1 + 0.5 * β²`), which is a common simplification in physics problems.\nUsing that approximation:\n`γ ≈ 1 + 0.5 * (0.2)² = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02`\n`d ≈ (v * Δt₀) * 1.02 = (60,000 * 50) * 1.02 = 3,000,000 * 1.02 = 3,060,000 km`\nThis matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
