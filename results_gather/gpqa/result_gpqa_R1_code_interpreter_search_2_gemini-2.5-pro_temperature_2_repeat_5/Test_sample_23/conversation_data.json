    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of Hydrogen (H) is given by: `Mass Fraction H = (y * mass(H)) / (x * mass(C) + y * mass(H))`.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the fraction is `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428 ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X is treated with a platinum (Pt) catalyst at high temperature to produce mixture Y. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context (Pt catalyst, unsaturated hydrocarbons) implies a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids and does not decolorize bromine water. This suggests its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, the cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Let the other component of Y be D. So, Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of D must also yield Z.\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to Z (a CnH2n cycloalkane), it must have the same C_n carbon skeleton.\n    *   Since D is part of mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, D must be an unsaturated compound that is unreactive towards Br2(aq). This strongly points to D being an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g., benzene or a substituted benzene), as aromaticity confers this stability.\n    *   The smallest and simplest aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6). For benzene to be formed and for its hydrogenation product to have the CnH2n formula, n must be 6. In this case, Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12). Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12) yields cyclohexane.\n    *   This provides a strong argument that n=6. Let's proceed with this hypothesis.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   D = Benzene (C6H6)\n        *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene} in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both A and B must have a C6-carbon skeleton that becomes a cyclohexane ring upon adding hydrogen.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B must have non-aromatic C=C double bonds.\n    *   The reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer: A + B → Z + D.\n        *   `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   Since the products Y (Z and D) are formed in an equimolar ratio from an equimolar mixture X (A and B), the stoichiometry is 1A + 1B → 1Z + 1D.\n    *   Let's perform an atom balance for hydrogen. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the total in one molecule of Z and one of D.\n        *   Total H atoms = H atoms in C6H12 + H atoms in C6H6 = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   In this reaction, one molecule is dehydrogenated (oxidized) to form benzene, and the other is hydrogenated (reduced) to form cyclohexane.\n        *   A logical choice is a C6 cycloalkadiene (more unsaturated) and a C6 cycloalkene (less unsaturated).\n        *   Let A be the C6 cycloalkadiene and B be the C6 cycloalkene.\n        *   The cycloalkene with a C6 ring is cyclohexene (C6H10).\n        *   The cycloalkadiene would have the formula C6H8. The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated. However, cyclohexa-1,4-diene has isolated double bonds and is not conjugated.\n    *   Let's check if this pair works:\n        *   A = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)\n        *   B = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   Both have C=C bonds and will decolorize bromine water. Check.\n        *   A is non-conjugated. Check.\n        *   Both have a C6 skeleton that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Check.\n        *   The reaction `C6H8 + C6H10 → C6H6 + C6H12` is balanced. The diene (A) is the hydrogen donor, and the alkene (B) is the hydrogen acceptor. This is a chemically sound disproportionation. Check.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   Mixture X consists of the two liquids A (cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8) and B (cyclohexene, C6H10).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H8) + (H atoms in C6H10)\n    *   Total H atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is 18. The other plausible case (n=7, leading to 22 H atoms) is also chemically possible, but the n=6 case represents the fundamental, unsubstituted parent system for this type of reaction, which is typically the intended answer in such problems. The existence of benzene as the simplest aromatic product strongly points towards n=6.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
