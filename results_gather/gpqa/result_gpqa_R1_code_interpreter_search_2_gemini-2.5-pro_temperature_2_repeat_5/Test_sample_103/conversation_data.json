    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be redshifted when moving away from us and blueshifted when moving towards us.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The Doppler shift formula is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\Delta \\lambda$ is the change in wavelength, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength, $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the star, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The maximum observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K_{star}$.\n    $$ K_{star} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} c $$\n    Since $\\lambda_0$ and $c$ are constants, the RV semi-amplitude $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n    $$ K_{star} \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max} $$\n    Given the data for the two systems:\n    -   Planet #1: $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ milliangstroms\n    -   Planet #2: $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ milliangstroms\n    The ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude to Physical Properties:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K_{star}$) can be related to the system's physical parameters: the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_s$), the orbital period ($P$), and the orbital inclination ($i$). The formula, under the valid assumption that the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_s$), is:\n    $$ K_{star} \\approx (2\\pi G)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s^{2/3} P^{1/3}} $$\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Compare the Two Systems:** We are given that:\n    -   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    -   The planets have similar masses: $M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$.\n    The term $M_p \\sin(i)$ is the \"minimum mass\" that the RV method measures. Since the problem asks for a single answer, we must assume that the effective masses being compared are the same. This implies that either the true masses and the inclinations are the same for both systems, or the measured minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$) is the same. In either case, the term $M_p \\sin(i)$ is the same for both systems.\n\n    Under these conditions, the terms $G$, $M_p \\sin(i)$, and $M_s$ are all constant for the comparison. The relationship simplifies to:\n    $$ K_{star} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}} $$\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    $$ P \\propto K_{star}^{-3} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** We want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n    Substituting the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes we found in step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:** Now, we compute the numerical value of the ratio.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods for the two exoplanets.\n# The ratio is given by (5/7)^3.\nperiod_ratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.3644314868804665\n```\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity method relies on the Doppler effect. The observed fractional change in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the star: $v_r/c = \\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda_0$. The maximum periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K_{star}$. Therefore, $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   For planet 1, $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms. Let its RV semi-amplitude be $K_1$.\n    *   For planet 2, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms. Let its RV semi-amplitude be $K_2$.\n    *   The ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n2.  **Relating RV Semi-Amplitude to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude is given by the formula (assuming the planet's mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_s$):\n    $$K_{star} \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_s^{2/3}}$$\n    where $P$ is the orbital period, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Comparing the Two Systems:** We are given that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$).\n    *   Since no information about inclination is given, we assume the measured \"effective\" mass, $M_p \\sin i$, is the same for both. This is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\n    With $M_s$, $M_p \\sin i$, and G being constants for the comparison, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $$K_{star} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$$\n\n4.  **Finding the Period Ratio:** From the proportionality above, we can write the relationship between the periods and the RV semi-amplitudes of the two systems:\n    $$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(1/P_1^{1/3})}{(1/P_2^{1/3})} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$$\n    We want to find the ratio of the periods, $P_2/P_1$. We can rearrange the equation:\n    $$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$$\n\n5.  **Calculation:** Now, substitute the known ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n    $$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing our result with the options provided:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
