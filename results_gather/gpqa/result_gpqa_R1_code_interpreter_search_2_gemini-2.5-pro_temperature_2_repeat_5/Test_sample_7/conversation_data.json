As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct conclusion from the experimental data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Role of Gene G2**\n\n*   **Single Mutant `g2`:** The knock-out mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance. This is a complete loss of function, meaning G2 is essential for resistance.\n*   **Double Mutants involving `g2`:**\n    *   The `g1g2` double mutant has 0% resistance.\n    *   The `g2g3` double mutant also has 0% resistance.\n*   **Epistasis Analysis:** In genetics, epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another gene. The gene that does the masking is called epistatic.\n    *   The phenotype of the `g1g2` double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0%). The `g2` mutation is masking any potential effect of the `g1` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   Similarly, the phenotype of the `g2g3` double mutant (0%) is identical to that of the `g2` single mutant (0%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n*   **Conclusion for G2:** When one gene is epistatic to others in a pathway, it typically means it acts upstream of them. Since we are told at least one gene is a transcription factor (a type of regulator that acts upstream), the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is the transcription factor**, and it is required to activate the expression or function of both G1 and G3.\n\nThis primary conclusion immediately eliminates option **A**, which states that G1 is the transcription factor. We can now focus on options B, C, and D, which all correctly identify G2 as the transcription factor.\n\n**2. Analyze the Relationship Between G1 and G3**\n\nNow we must differentiate between options B, C, and D by examining the interaction between G1 and G3.\n\n*   **Single Mutants:**\n    *   `g1` (G3 is active): 75% resistance. The loss of G1 leads to a 25% drop in resistance.\n    *   `g3` (G1 is active): 50% resistance. The loss of G3 leads to a 50% drop in resistance.\n*   **Double Mutant:**\n    *   `g1g3`: 10% resistance. The loss of both genes leads to a 90% drop in resistance.\n\nLet's evaluate the descriptive terms in the remaining options:\n\n*   **Gene Redundancy (Option C):** Redundancy means the genes have similar functions, so losing one has little effect because the other can compensate. We would expect the single mutants (`g1` and `g3`) to have resistance close to 100%, and the double mutant to have a severe drop. The data shows significant drops for both single mutants (25% and 50%), which contradicts the idea of redundancy. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Pleiotropy (Option D):** Pleiotropy means one gene influences multiple unrelated traits. This experiment only measures one trait: resistance to anthracnose. There is no data to support or reject the idea of pleiotropy. It is an unsubstantiated claim in this context.\n\n*   **Epistasis between G1 and G3 (Options B and D):**\n    *   The `g1g3` double mutant has a phenotype (10% resistance) that is different from both the `g1` single mutant (75%) and the `g3` single mutant (50%). In fact, it's a more severe phenotype than either one alone. This is a classic example of a **synergistic gene interaction**, where the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects (90% loss > 25% loss + 50% loss).\n    *   Because the double mutant phenotype is novel and not a masking of one of the single mutant phenotypes, strictly speaking, there is no simple epistasis between G1 and G3. However, multiple-choice questions sometimes use terminology loosely. Let's consider a possible alternative interpretation where \"epistatic\" might refer to the gene with the stronger phenotypic effect. The `g3` mutation (50% resistance) causes a stronger phenotype than the `g1` mutation (75% resistance). Under this loose definition, one might say \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\". Option **B** makes this claim, while option **D** makes the opposite claim (`G1 is epistatic towards G3`), which is incorrect even by this loose definition.\n\n**3. Synthesize and Select the Best Option**\n\nLet's review the remaining options:\n\n*   **Option B:** G2 is a transcription factor (Correct), G1 and G3 has the same promoter (Plausible, as they are both regulated by G2), G3 is epistatic towards G1 (Correct, if using the loose definition of \"stronger effect\").\n*   **Option D:** G2 is a transcription factor (Correct), G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (Unsubstantiated), G1 is epistatic towards G3 (Incorrect).\n\nComparing B and D, Option B provides a more coherent explanation. The idea that co-regulated genes might share promoter elements is a reasonable biological hypothesis. The final clause, while using \"epistatic\" imprecisely, correctly identifies G3 as having a stronger effect than G1. Option D contains an unsubstantiated claim (pleiotropy) and an incorrect claim about the relative effects of G1 and G3.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the best conclusion that can be drawn from the available data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
