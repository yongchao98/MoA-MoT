    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption peak in the region of 3300-2500 cm⁻¹ is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp absorption peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. This specific wavenumber is typical for the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group is present but doesn't differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the options lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent protons according to the n+1 rule, applied sequentially for non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n\n*   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This confirms the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This complex splitting pattern means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to **one** neighboring proton (1+1 = 2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (2+1 = 3 lines).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Coupling to **three** equivalent neighboring protons (3+1 = 4 lines).\n    Therefore, the proton giving this signal must be a methine (CH) proton adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This pattern means a different proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to **one** neighboring proton (1+1 = 2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (2+1 = 3 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to another, different set of **two** equivalent neighboring protons (2+1 = 3 lines).\n    Therefore, the proton giving this signal must be a methine (CH) proton adjacent to a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Each Proposed Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the methine (CH) protons in each structure to see if they match the required neighbor environments.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(COOH)-CH₃`\n*   Proton on C3 (`-CH(CH₃)-`): Its neighbors are C2-H (1H), C4-H₂ (2H), and the C3-methyl (3H). This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₃`) would result in a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   Does it have a `dtt`? No. There is no methine (CH) proton with neighbors `CH`, `CH₂`, and another `CH₂`.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃-CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(COOH)-C₂H₅`\n*   Proton on C3 (`-CH(C₂H₅)-`): Its neighbors are C2-H (1H), C4-H₂ (2H), and the CH₂ of the C3-ethyl group (2H). This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₂`) would result in a **dtt**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   Does it have a `dtq`? No. There is no methine (CH) proton with neighbors `CH`, `CH₂`, and `CH₃`.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   Proton on C3 (`-CH(CH₃)-`): Its neighbors are C4-H (1H), C2-H₂ (2H), and the C3-methyl (3H). This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₃`) would result in a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   Does it have a `dtt`? No. The other methine proton (on C4) is next to a CH and two CH₃ groups, which would give a doublet of septets.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nLet's draw the structure derived from the condensed formula: `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`.\nThe structure has two adjacent chiral methine centers, at C3 and C4.\n\n   **CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH**\n      ⁵   ⁴         ³         ²      ¹\n\n*   **Analyze the proton on C3:**\n    *   It is a methine (`CH`) proton.\n    *   Its neighbors are: the `CH` proton on C4 (1H), the `CH₂` protons on C2 (2H), and the `CH₂` protons of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2H).\n    *   The neighbors are a `CH`, a `CH₂`, and another `CH₂`. This environment perfectly matches the requirements for a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n*   **Analyze the proton on C4:**\n    *   It is a methine (`CH`) proton.\n    *   Its neighbors are: the `CH` proton on C3 (1H), the `CH₂` protons of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2H), and the terminal `CH₃` protons on C5 (3H).\n    *   The neighbors are a `CH`, a `CH₂`, and a `CH₃`. This environment perfectly matches the requirements for a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStructure D is the only compound that contains both a proton that would produce a `dtt` signal (the one at C3) and a different proton that would produce a `dtq` signal (the one at C4). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
