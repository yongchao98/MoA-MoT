    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1) mCPBA, followed by 2) aqueous acid (H3O+). This sequence achieves **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups (like -OH) to an (E)-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n*   **Let's verify with the mechanism:**\n    1.  **(E)-alkene + mCPBA (syn-addition):** The syn-addition to a trans-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides. In this case, we get a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-trans-4,5-epoxyoctane. These are two chiral molecules, mirror images of each other.\n    2.  **Epoxide Ring Opening with H3O+ (anti-addition):** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening by water is an SN2-like process with anti-attack.\n        *   Taking one enantiomer, say (4R,5R)-epoxide: Water can attack C4 or C5.\n            *   Attack at C4 inverts its configuration from R to S. The other center (C5) remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack at C5 inverts its configuration from R to S. The other center (C4) remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Note that (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are just different names for the **same meso compound**, as the substituents on C4 and C5 are identical (H, OH, propyl).\n        *   Taking the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, will also lead to the same single meso diol product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, the meso compound **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the *anti*-diol).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as reaction 1, leading to **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a (Z)-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n*   **Let's verify with the mechanism:**\n    1.  **(Z)-alkene + mCPBA (syn-addition):** The syn-addition to a cis-alkene produces a meso epoxide. In this case, we get the single, achiral *cis*-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Epoxide Ring Opening with H3O+ (anti-addition):**\n        *   Starting with the meso *cis*-epoxide: Water can attack either C4 or C5. Let's denote the meso epoxide configuration as (4R,5S) for analysis (remembering it's achiral).\n            *   Attack at C4 (R) inverts its configuration to S. The other center (C5) remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n            *   Attack at C5 (S) inverts its configuration to R. The other center (C4) remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, are enantiomers. Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, they are formed in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the *syn*-diols).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n\n1.  **Product from R1:** The meso-diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n2.  **Products from R2:** The pair of enantiomers, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these three compounds:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the meso-diol will produce one peak, and the racemic mixture of enantiomers will produce a second peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It can separate both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct compounds in the mixture will be resolved. The meso-diol will give one peak, and each of the two enantiomers will give its own separate peak.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
