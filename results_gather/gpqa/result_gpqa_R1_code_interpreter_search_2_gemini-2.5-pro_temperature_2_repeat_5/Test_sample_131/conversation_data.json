    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given by the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14. This means each molecule has an index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation) of 4, consistent with a benzene ring.\n*   **Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This is a crucial piece of information. Since the mixture is 1:1, a 1:1 signal ratio means that the number of protons giving rise to the first signal (from Compound A) is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal (from Compound B).\n*   **Alkyl Region (around 2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. The fact that they are all singlets indicates that the protons of these alkyl groups have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This suggests the alkyl groups are methyl groups or other groups without adjacent protons (like t-butyl, which is not an option here).\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They do not have any adjacent proton neighbors, so they will appear as a single **singlet**. This signal will integrate to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet**. This signal will integrate to 4 x 3H = **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C5 and C3-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although adjacent, equivalent protons do not split each other, so they will appear as a single **singlet**. This signal integrates to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (one signal, singlet, 6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other (a second signal, singlet, 6H). So, we expect two **singlets** in a 6H:6H (or 1:1) ratio.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. H4 is between two methyl groups (at C3 and C5), while H6 is between two different methyl groups (at C1 and C5). They will appear as two distinct **singlets** (as they have no proton neighbors), each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are four non-equivalent methyl groups, which would ideally lead to four separate **singlets**, each integrating to 3H. (In some cases, accidental overlap could reduce the number of observed signals).\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each) and up to 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. The CH2 (methylene) protons will be a **quartet** (split by the 3 CH3 protons), and the CH3 (methyl) protons will be a **triplet** (split by the 2 CH2 protons). The observation of only singlets in the alkyl region of the mixture spectrum immediately rules out **1,4-diethylbenzene**.\n\n**3. Combine the Spectra to Match the Mixture Data**\n\nNow we test the remaining options by considering a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The mixture shows **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   A mixture of Durene (1 aromatic singlet, 2H) and Prehnitene (1 aromatic singlet, 2H) would show two aromatic singlets (assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts). Since both signals represent 2H in a 1:1 mixture, their integration ratio would be 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Any mixture with Isodurene (which itself has two 1H aromatic singlets) would result in a total of three or more aromatic signals, which contradicts the data. For instance, a mixture of Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) and Isodurene (two 1H singlets) would give three aromatic signals in total.\n\nBased on the aromatic region alone, the mixture must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:** Let's verify this conclusion with the alkyl region data. The mixture should show **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Durene contributes: one singlet (12H).\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two singlets (6H each).\n    *   The combined spectrum will have a total of three singlets (assuming they don't overlap perfectly). The integration ratio of these signals will be 12H : 6H : 6H.\n    *   Simplifying this ratio: 12:6:6 = **2:1:1**.\n\nThis also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe two compounds present in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
