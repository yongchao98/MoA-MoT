    "*   **Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = \\left[ \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a^2} \\right]^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   L is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   a is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\n    Since the planets orbit the same star, L is constant. We are also given that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, all terms except for 'a' are constant for this system. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto (a^{-2})^{1/4}$\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n    This means the orbital distance 'a' is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n    $a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances**\n    From the relationship derived in Step 1, we can write the ratio of orbital distances in terms of the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.\n    $\\frac{a_x}{a_y} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,y}}{T_{eq,x}} \\right)^2$\n\n    We want to find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to that of Planet1 ($\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$). We can find this by combining the given ratios:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$\n\n    Using the temperature ratios provided:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 2.3$\n\n    Now we calculate the individual distance ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} \\right)^2 = (1.4)^2$\n    *   $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} \\right)^2 = (2.3)^2$\n\n    Multiplying these gives the overall distance ratio:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (2.3)^2 \\times (1.4)^2 = (2.3 \\times 1.4)^2$\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n    This means the ratio of the orbital periods is:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}$\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Final Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n    Substitute the expression for the ratio of orbital distances from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left[ (2.3 \\times 1.4)^2 \\right]^{3/2}$\n\n    The exponents multiply: $2 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 3$.\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (2.3 \\times 1.4)^3$\n\n    Now, we perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nresult = (2.3 * 1.4)**3\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\n33.386168000000006\n```\nThe result is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planet masses and the specific albedo value is not needed for the calculation, as these factors cancel out when dealing with ratios for planets orbiting the same star.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of about 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n    where `L` is the star's luminosity, `A` is the albedo, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and `a` is the orbital distance (semi-major axis).\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, `L` is constant. We are also told the albedo `A` is the same for all three. The other terms are physical constants. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\implies T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n    This means that the orbital distance `a` is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n    $a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances:**\n    We can express the ratio of orbital distances for any two planets (x and y) in terms of their temperature ratios:\n    $\\frac{a_x}{a_y} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,y}}{T_{eq,x}} \\right)^2$\n\n    We want to find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to that of Planet1 ($\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$). We can do this by combining the known ratios:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$\n\n    Using the given temperature ratios:\n    *   Ratio between Planet 1 and 2: $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = 1.4$\n    *   Ratio between Planet 2 and 3: $\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 2.3$\n\n    Now we calculate the individual distance ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} \\right)^2 = (1.4)^2$\n    *   $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} \\right)^2 = (2.3)^2$\n\n    Multiplying them together gives the overall distance ratio:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 \\times (2.3)^2$\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period (Kepler's Third Law):**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    We can now find the ratio of the periods for Planet3 and Planet1:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}$\n\n    Substitute the expression for the distance ratio from step 2 into this equation:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( (1.4)^2 \\times (2.3)^2 \\right)^{3/2}$\n\n    We can simplify the exponent:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (1.4 \\times 2.3)^{2 \\times (3/2)}$\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (1.4 \\times 2.3)^3$\n\n    Now, we perform the calculation:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.386$\n\n    This value is approximately 33.4.\n\n(Note: The information about the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is extra detail not required for this specific calculation, as Kepler's Third Law for planets around the same star doesn't depend on the planets' masses.)\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1.\n\n# Given ratios of equilibrium temperatures:\nT1_div_T2 = 1.4\nT2_div_T3 = 2.3\n\n# From T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2), we have a ∝ T_eq^(-2).\n# Therefore, a_x / a_y = (T_y / T_x)^2.\n\n# Ratio of orbital distances a2/a1:\na2_div_a1 = (T1_div_T2)**2\n\n# Ratio of orbital distances a3/a2:\na3_div_a2 = (T2_div_T3)**2\n\n# Overall ratio of orbital distances a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1):\na3_div_a1 = a3_div_a2 * a2_div_a1\n\n# From Kepler's Third Law, P ∝ a^(3/2).\n# Therefore, P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2).\nP3_div_P1 = a3_div_a1**(3/2)\n\n# A more direct calculation: P3/P1 = ((T1/T2) * (T2/T3))^3\nfinal_ratio = (T1_div_T2 * T2_div_T3)**3\n\nprint(final_ratio)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
