    "This problem involves the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, resulting in two photons. To solve this, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum from special relativity.\n\n**1. Define the System and Variables**\n\n*   Let the rest mass of both the electron and the positron be `m_e`.\n*   Let the speed of light be `c`.\n*   The electron moves from left to right (positive x-direction) with a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n*   The positron moves from right to left (negative x-direction) with a Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.\n*   After annihilation, two photons are produced. They have the same energy, `E_γ`.\n*   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This implies their momentum vectors are symmetric with respect to the horizontal (x) axis. Let the angle of the upper photon with the x-axis be `θ` and the lower photon's angle be `-θ`. The question asks for the total angle between them, which is `2θ`.\n\n**2. Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\nThe energy `E` and momentum `p` of a particle with rest mass `m` and Lorentz factor `γ` are given by:\n*   `E = γmc^2`\n*   `p = sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2) / c = sqrt(γ^2 - 1)mc`\n\n**For the electron:**\n*   `γ_e = 4`\n*   Energy: `E_e = 4 * m_e * c^2`\n*   Momentum: `p_e = sqrt(4^2 - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c`. The direction is along the +x axis.\n\n**For the positron:**\n*   `γ_p = 2`\n*   Energy: `E_p = 2 * m_e * c^2`\n*   Momentum: `p_p = sqrt(2^2 - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(3) * m_e * c`. The direction is along the -x axis.\n\n**Total initial state:**\n*   Total Energy `E_total_initial = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2)m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2`.\n*   Total Momentum `p_total_initial` (only has an x-component):\n    `p_total_x = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`.\n    `p_total_y = 0`.\n\n**3. Define Final State (Two Photons)**\n\n*   Photons are massless, so their energy and momentum are related by `E_γ = p_γ c`.\n*   The problem states the two photons have the same energy, `E_γ`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\n*   `E_total_final = E_total_initial`\n*   `E_γ + E_γ = 6 m_e c^2`\n*   `2 * E_γ = 6 m_e c^2`\n*   `E_γ = 3 m_e c^2`\n\nThis is the energy of each individual photon.\nThe momentum of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3 m_e c`.\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   The final momentum must equal the initial momentum.\n*   **Y-component:**\n    The initial y-momentum is 0. For the final state:\n    `p_final_y = p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-θ) = p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0`.\n    This confirms that the angles must be symmetric `θ` and `-θ` as expected from the problem description.\n*   **X-component:**\n    The final x-momentum must equal the initial x-momentum.\n    `p_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`\n    `p_total_x = p_final_x`\n    `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n    `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nWe can cancel `m_e c` from both sides:\n`sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nNow we calculate the value of `θ` and then the angle between the photons, `2θ`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians using the arccosine function\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The angle between the two photons is 2*theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\n>>>\n138.16911634862416\n>>>\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138 degrees. Comparing this to the options:\nA) 74\nB) 138\nC) 96\nD) 172\n\nThe closest option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a problem of relativistic mechanics, specifically involving particle annihilation. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum\n\nLet `m` be the rest mass of an electron (and a positron), and `c` be the speed of light.\n\nThe energy `E` and momentum `p` of a particle with rest mass `m` and Lorentz factor `γ` are given by:\n*   `E = γmc²`\n*   `p = √(γ² - 1)mc`\n\n**For the electron:**\n*   Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`. It moves from the left, which we'll define as the positive x-direction.\n*   Energy: `E_e = 4mc²`\n*   Momentum: `p_e = √(4² - 1)mc = √15 mc` (in the +x direction)\n\n**For the positron:**\n*   Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. It moves from the right, which is the negative x-direction.\n*   Energy: `E_p = 2mc²`\n*   Momentum: `p_p = √(2² - 1)mc = √3 mc` (in the -x direction)\n\n**Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n*   Total Energy `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`\n*   Total Momentum `p_initial = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`. This momentum is entirely along the x-axis.\n\n### 2. Final State: Two Photons\n\nThe collision produces two photons.\n\n*   The problem states the two photons have the same energy, `E_γ`.\n*   A photon's momentum `p_γ` is related to its energy by `E_γ = p_γc`.\n*   The photons move away at angles to the horizontal axis. Due to momentum conservation in the y-direction (which is initially zero), the photons must move at equal and opposite angles to the x-axis. Let's call these angles `θ` and `-θ`.\n\n### 3. Conservation Laws\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total final energy must equal the total initial energy.\n`E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`\n`2E_γ = E_initial = 6mc²`\n`E_γ = 3mc²`\n\nThis is the energy of each of the two resulting photons. From this, we can find the magnitude of the momentum of each photon:\n`p_γ = E_γ / c = 3mc`\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total final momentum must equal the total initial momentum. We only need to consider the x-component since the y-components cancel out.\n*   Initial momentum (x-component): `p_initial_x = (√15 - √3)mc`\n*   Final momentum (x-component): The x-component of momentum for each photon is `p_γ cos(θ)`. The total final momentum in the x-direction is `p_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n\nEquating initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\n`p_initial_x = p_final_x`\n`(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n\nNow, substitute `p_γ = 3mc`:\n`(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n`(√15 - √3)mc = 6mc cos(θ)`\n\n### 4. Solving for the Angle\n\nWe can cancel `mc` from both sides to solve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n\nThe angle we are looking for is the total angle between the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n`Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`\n\nThe Python code calculated this value to be approximately 138.17 degrees.\n\n`cos(θ) = (3.87298 - 1.73205) / 6 = 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.35682`\n`θ = arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69.08°`\n`Angle = 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.08° = 138.16°`\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<B>>>"
