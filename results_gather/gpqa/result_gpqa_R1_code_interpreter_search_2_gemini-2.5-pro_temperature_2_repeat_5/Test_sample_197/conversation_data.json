    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **List the species and equilibria:** In a solution of `Co(II)` and `SCN-`, several complex species can form. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free cobalt ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n3.  **Use the stability constants:** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the free thiocyanate ligand concentration `[SCN-]`, and the overall stability constants (`βn`). Let `L = [SCN-]`.\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * L`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * L^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * L^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * L^4`\n\n4.  **Formulate the mole fraction (`α`):** The percentage of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)n]`, is found by calculating its mole fraction (`α_n`) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction `α_2` for the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex is:\n    `α_2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n5.  **Substitute and simplify:** Substitute the expressions for `c(Co)` and `[Co(SCN)2]` into the mole fraction equation:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1*L + β2*L^2 + β3*L^3 + β4*L^4)`\n    `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * L^2`\n\n    `α_2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * L^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1*L + β2*L^2 + β3*L^3 + β4*L^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, showing that the mole fraction depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants, not on the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α_2 = (β2 * L^2) / (1 + β1*L + β2*L^2 + β3*L^3 + β4*L^4)`\n\n6.  **Plug in the given values:**\n    *   `L = [SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n7.  **Calculate the terms:**\n    *   Numerator term (`β2 * L^2`): `40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Denominator terms:\n        *   `1`\n        *   `β1*L`: `9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   `β2*L^2`: `40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n        *   `β3*L^3`: `63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n        *   `β4*L^4`: `16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n\n8.  **Calculate the final value:**\n    *   Sum of denominator terms (S): `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n    *   `α_2 = Numerator / S = 0.4 / 2.3646`\n    *   Percentage = `α_2 * 100`\n\nA Python script can be used for precise calculation.\n```python\nimport sys\n# Define the stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-] concentration in M\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the alpha_2 fraction (the term corresponding to [Co(SCN)2])\nnumerator = beta2 * L**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator (the sum of all terms in the distribution polynomial)\n# S = 1 (for Co2+) + beta1*L + beta2*L^2 + beta3*L^3 + beta4*L^4\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * L) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate the percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n>>>\n16.91618032648228\n<<<\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.92%, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution with a total cobalt concentration of `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` and a thiocyanate concentration of `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`.\n\n**1. Understanding the System**\n\nIn the solution, a series of complexation equilibria exist:\n`Co^2+ + SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)]^+` (governed by β₁)\n`Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` (governed by β₂)\n`Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)3]^-` (governed by β₃)\n`Co^2+ + 4 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-` (governed by β₄)\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt `c(Co)` is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n**2. Mole Fraction Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]`, which is equivalent to its mole fraction (`α₂`) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction `α₂` is given by:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the ligand concentration `[SCN-]`, and the overall stability constants `βn`:\n`[Co(SCN)n] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^n`\n\nSubstituting these into the mole fraction equation:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β₁[Co^2+][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co^2+][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co^2+][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co^2+][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nWe can factor out `[Co^2+]` from the denominator, which then cancels with the numerator:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThis shows that the fraction of each species depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`, not the total metal concentration. The problem states `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`.\n\n**3. Plugging in the Values**\n\nGiven:\n`[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n`β₁ = 9`\n`β₂ = 40`\n`β₃ = 63`\n`β₄ = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1` (for `[Co^2+]`)\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to `[Co(SCN)2]`:\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 0.4\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.92%\n\nThe code output confirms this calculation: `16.91618...%`.\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
