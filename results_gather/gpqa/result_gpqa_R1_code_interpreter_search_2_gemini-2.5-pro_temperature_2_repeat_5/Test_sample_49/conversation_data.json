    "This is a problem about dimensional analysis and understanding the structure of loop calculations in quantum field theory. The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the powers of certain factors that appear in the expression for the diagram's amplitude.\n\n1.  **Identify the Loop Factor:** In quantum field theory calculations, each loop in a Feynman diagram corresponds to an integral over an undetermined momentum, called a loop momentum `k`. In `D` spacetime dimensions, this integral is of the form `∫ d^D k / (2π)^D`.\n\n2.  **Dimensional Regularization:** When these integrals are evaluated using standard techniques like dimensional regularization, the process of integrating over the `D`-dimensional momentum space introduces a characteristic factor for each loop. For a single loop in `D` dimensions, this factor is typically proportional to `1 / (4π)^(D/2)`.\n\n3.  **Applying to Four Dimensions:** The problem states the theory is on four-dimensional spacetime, so we set `D = 4`. The factor associated with each loop is therefore `1 / (4π)^(4/2) = 1 / (4π)^2`.\n\n4.  **Counting the Loops:** If a diagram has `L` loops, the overall factor from the loop integrations will be `(1 / (4π)^2)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Given Expression:** The expression provided is `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`. We can see the factor `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\n6.  **Solving for L:** We equate the general loop factor with the one in the expression:\n    `1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4pi)^6`\n    This implies that the exponents must be equal:\n    `2L = 6`\n    Solving for `L`, the number of loops, we get:\n    `L = 3`\n\nThe other terms in the expression provide additional context but are not needed to determine the loop number. `alpha^3 * g^2` indicates there are five vertices in total (three of one type and two of another), and `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of energy scales that often appears in the result of the calculation. The `sqrt(2) * 8` are numerical factors from symmetries or matrix algebra. The most direct indicator of the loop number is the power of `(4π)`.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
