    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern. Let's analyze their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strong activator, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Weak activator, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which creates significant steric hindrance.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nThe key structural features are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nThe meta relationship between the strong ortho-, para-directing -OEt group and the -NO2 group is a major clue. It suggests that the nitration step did not occur when the -OEt group (or its precursor, -OH) was present, as it would have directed the substitution to the ortho and para positions (4 and 6), not the meta position (3). This implies that nitration likely occurred when a meta-directing group was at position 1.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's systematically evaluate each proposed reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    1.  `i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene`: This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  `ii) Nitration`: The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to its bulk, the para product, 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene, is the major product. This leads to a 1,4-substitution pattern.\n    3.  Subsequent steps would functionalize this 1,4-disubstituted ring. For example, reduction of the nitro group to an amine, followed by another nitration ortho to the amine, leads to a 2,4-disubstituted aniline. Ultimately, this sequence will produce a 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene (e.g., 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), not the required 1,2,3 isomer. Thus, Option A will not provide the target compound in high yield.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    1.  `i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene`. Correct.\n    2.  `ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline`. Correct.\n    3.  `iii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the nitrogen atom of the amino group is a Lewis base and coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the ring so strongly that the reaction does not proceed. Therefore, Option C is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ...`\n    The order of reactions is chemically nonsensical. For instance, step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires an amino group. However, the preceding steps have not generated an amino group. Step `viii) Fe/HCl` (reduction of a nitro group to an amine) appears much later in the sequence. A correct synthesis must follow a logical order of reactions. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    This sequence appears complex and contains a strange duplicated step (`vi) HNO3/H2SO4`), suggesting a possible typo. However, it is the only option that utilizes a **sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a blocking group**, which is a classic strategy for achieving difficult substitution patterns. Let's reconstruct a logical synthesis using the reagents from this list, assuming there are typos in the ordering/duplication. A plausible (though intricate) synthesis that achieves the desired 1,2,3 pattern can be constructed, highlighting the purpose of each reagent provided in option B.\n\n    Let's follow a logical path that correctly utilizes a blocking group strategy, which the reagents in B allow for:\n    1.  `i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`.\n    2.  `ii) Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4)`: The bulky t-butyl group directs the sulfonation to the para position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    3.  The sequence now needs to build the rest of the molecule. The other options lead to incorrect isomers or are chemically flawed. While the exact sequence listed in B is problematic (especially step vi), the set of reagents it provides points toward the most sophisticated and plausible strategy for this challenging synthesis. It involves blocking a position (para with -SO3H), performing substitutions on the remaining sites, and then removing the blocking group. No other option offers this level of strategic control.\n\n    Let's analyze a corrected plausible pathway using the reagents from B.\n    1. **(i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Benzene -> *tert-butylbenzene*.\n    2. **(ii) SO3/H2SO4:** *tert-butylbenzene* -> *p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid*. The sulfonic acid group acts as a bulky, meta-directing blocking group.\n    3. **(iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration occurs ortho to the t-butyl group and meta to the sulfonic acid group. -> *4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid*.\n    4. **Now we need to get rid of the original nitro group and the sulfonic acid, and add the new nitro and ethoxy groups in the correct positions. This path gets complicated and does not lead to the desired product directly.**\n\n    However, let's reconsider the entire process. The key is that obtaining the 1,2,3 pattern from simple EAS on benzene is notoriously difficult. A route involving a blocking group is the most probable \"textbook\" solution, even if complex. Option B is the only one that includes the reagents for adding and removing a blocking group (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`).\n    *   Steps `iv, v, vii, ix` represent a standard transformation of a nitro group into an ethoxy group (NO2 -> NH2 -> N2+ -> OH -> OEt).\n    *   This implies that somewhere in the synthesis, a nitro group is introduced and then converted to the ethoxy group, while another nitro group is added that remains in the final product.\n\n    Given that options A, C, and D are clearly incorrect due to producing the wrong isomer or containing fatal chemical errors, Option B remains the only possibility. It proposes the use of a blocking group and a complex sequence of functional group interconversions, which is precisely the type of strategy required for such a challenging target. Despite the apparent typos, it represents the most viable synthetic logic among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
