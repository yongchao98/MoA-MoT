    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The crucial property of fermions is that they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in a potential well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number, `n`) and its spin (spin quantum number, `m_s`).\n\n3.  **Define the Energy Levels and States:**\n    *   For a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy of a single particle in the `n`-th level is given by `E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    *   The problem defines `E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n    *   For each energy level `n`, a spin-1/2 particle can have two possible spin states: spin-up (`m_s = +1/2`) or spin-down (`m_s = -1/2`).\n    *   This means, according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs):**\n    The ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n    *   **Level n=1 (Energy E_1 = 1²E = E):** We place the first two fermions here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   **Level n=2 (Energy E_2 = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two fermions here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** The total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles.\n        `E_gs = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)`\n        `E_gs = (2 * E) + (2 * 4E)`\n        `E_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n5.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. We can find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3` (`E_3 = 3²E = 9E`).\n    *   We move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        `E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n        `E_1st = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)`\n        `E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy after the first excitation.\n    *   **Possibility (a):** Promote a particle from a lower level in the ground state. Let's move a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)` = `(1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)` = `E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility (b):** Promote two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, zero in `n=2`, two in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3)` = `(2 * E) + (2 * 9E)` = `2E + 18E = 20E`.\n\n    Comparing the possible excitation energies, the lowest energy after `15E` is `18E`.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** `E_2nd = 18E`\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
