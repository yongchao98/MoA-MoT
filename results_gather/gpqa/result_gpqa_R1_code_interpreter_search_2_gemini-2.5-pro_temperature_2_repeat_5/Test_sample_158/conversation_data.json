    "This problem requires us to determine the comoving distance to a quasar given its spectral properties and a specific cosmological model.\n\n**1. Identifying the Spectral Feature and Calculating Redshift (z):**\n\nThe problem describes a peak in the quasar's spectrum at 790 nm, with a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths. This is a classic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line, which has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe. The absorption by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at wavelengths shorter than the redshifted Lyα line creates a \"forest\" of absorption lines and eventually the Gunn-Peterson trough, causing the flux to drop.\n\n*   The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line (λ_rest) is approximately 121.6 nm.\n*   The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is 790 nm.\n\nThe redshift (z) is calculated using the formula:\n1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest\nz = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 ≈ 5.497\n\n**2. Calculating the Comoving Distance:**\n\nIn a flat (Ω_k = 0) Lambda-CDM universe, the comoving distance (D_c) is calculated by integrating over redshift.
