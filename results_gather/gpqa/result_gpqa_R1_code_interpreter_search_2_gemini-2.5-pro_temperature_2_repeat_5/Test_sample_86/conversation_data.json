    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" implies a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbons:** \"8 carbon atoms in total\". The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must have 8 - 6 = 2 carbons.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   \"presence of a carbonyl group\" indicates a C=O double bond.\n    *   \"presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\" indicates a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n*   **Putting it together:** One substituent is a halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms, which are 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. Let's call this substituent R. So, R must be a C2H_yO group.\n\n**2. Identify Possible Structures for the Second Substituent (R)**\n\nThe substituent R has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. Two common isomers fit this description:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O group. The total molecular formula would be C8H7OX. The compound is a haloacetophenone.\n*   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a C=O group. The total molecular formula would be C8H7OX. The compound is a (halophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\nSo, the unknown compound is likely either a haloacetophenone or a (halophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options**\n\nLet's analyze the four options provided. An important feature of a di-substituted benzene ring is that it has 4 protons on the ring. The pattern of these signals reveals the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)...**\n    The aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This is a classic pattern for a **para (1,4)-substituted** benzene ring. The spectrum also shows a peak at 9.9 ppm (1H, s), which is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton, and a peak at 3.7 ppm (2H, s), likely a **methylene (-CH2-)** group. This spectrum points towards a para-substituted (halophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)...**\n    The aromatic region is identical to option A, indicating a **para-substituted** ring. The spectrum also shows a peak at 2.3 ppm (3H, s), which is characteristic of a **methyl (-CH3)** group singlet. This spectrum points towards a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d)...**\n    This spectrum shows no peaks in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be correct for an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s)...**\n    This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region. A di-substituted ring must have four aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n**4. Compare the Plausible Structures with the Plausible Spectra (A and B)**\n\nWe must now decide between option A (p-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde) and option B (p-haloacetophenone). Let's predict the expected spectra and compare.\n\n*   **For Structure A (p-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde, X-C6H4-CH2CHO):**\n    *   We expect signals for the aldehyde proton (-CHO), the methylene protons (-CH2-), and the para-substituted aromatic protons.\n    *   The -CHO and -CH2- protons are adjacent. They should couple with each other, meaning the CHO peak should be a **triplet (t)** and the CH2 peak should be a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   Option A lists them as **singlets (s)**. This is a major discrepancy in the multiplicity. While this can happen under special conditions (like rapid proton exchange), it's not the standard spectrum.\n    *   Furthermore, the substituents (-X and -CH2CHO) are both relatively weak electron-withdrawing groups. The aromatic protons should appear around 7.2-7.4 ppm (as confirmed by database searches for p-chlorophenylacetaldehyde). The shifts in Option A (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are too far downfield for this structure.\n\n*   **For Structure B (p-haloacetophenone, X-C6H4-COCH3):**\n    *   We expect signals for the methyl protons (-CH3) and the para-substituted aromatic protons.\n    *   The methyl group is a **singlet (s)** as there are no adjacent protons. The aromatic protons are two **doublets (d)**. This matches the multiplicity in Option B perfectly.\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Paired with a halogen, this will shift the aromatic protons significantly downfield. The values of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are very typical for this structure (e.g., p-bromoacetophenone has peaks at 7.82 and 7.62 ppm).\n    *   The methyl group in acetophenones typically appears around 2.5-2.6 ppm. Option B lists it at 2.3 ppm. This chemical shift is lower than expected but is a more plausible error/variation in a problem than the combined errors in multiplicity and chemical shift seen in Option A.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe NMR data in Option B matches the structure of a p-haloacetophenone in terms of multiplicity (splitting pattern) and the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons. Although the chemical shift for the methyl group (2.3 ppm) is slightly off from typical database values (~2.6 ppm), it is the best fit among the choices. Option A is a poor fit because both the splitting pattern (singlets instead of doublet/triplet) and the aromatic proton chemical shifts are inconsistent with the proposed structure.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a p-haloacetophenone, and the corresponding NMR data is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
