    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The potential energy is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three dimensions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The total potential is $V(x,y,z) = V(x) + V(y) + V(z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$. This means the system behaves as three independent one-dimensional (1D) quantum harmonic oscillators.\n\n    The energy eigenvalue of a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three 1D oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    We define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy Level for the Third Excited State:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, which corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z \\ge 0$, the minimum value is $n = 0+0+0 = 0$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** The next highest energy level corresponds to $n=1$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** The next level corresponds to $n=2$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** The state we are interested in corresponds to $n=3$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    We substitute $n=3$ into the energy formula:\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = (\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different quantum states (i.e., different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$) that have the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ that add up to 3.\n\n    The general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level is:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\n    For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n    Alternatively, we can list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    *   Ways to sum to 3 with (3, 0, 0) and its permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) --- **3 states**\n    *   Ways to sum to 3 with (2, 1, 0) and its permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) --- **6 states**\n    *   Ways to sum to 3 with (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) --- **1 state**\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$. The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy eigenvalue is therefore 10.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the degeneracy is 10. This matches option D.\n\n    (Note: Options B and C present an energy form proportional to $1/r^2$, which is characteristic of a particle in a spherical infinite potential well, not a harmonic oscillator. This makes them incorrect from the start.)\n\n<<<D>>>"
