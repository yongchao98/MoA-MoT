    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that compound A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for a binary fluoride can be written as YF_n.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine is given by:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    where M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (19.00 * n) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * n)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * n = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can now test integer values of 'n' to find plausible molar masses for Y and match them to known elements.\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest element: Calcium, Ca=40.08)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Closest element: Bromine, Br=79.90)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Closest element: Antimony, Sb=121.76)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No common element)\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Closest elements: Thallium, Tl=204.4; Mercury, Hg=200.6)\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Closest element: Plutonium, Pu=244)\n\n    Let's calculate the theoretical ɷF for the most likely candidates:\n    *   If Y=Br and n=2 (A2=BrF2): ɷF = (2*19)/ (79.9+38) = 32.23%. (Close)\n    *   If Y=Sb and n=3 (A2=SbF3): ɷF = (3*19) / (121.76+57) = 31.89%. (Very close)\n    *   If Y=Pu and n=6 (A2=PuF6): ɷF = (6*19) / (244+114) = 31.84%. (Very close)\n\n    The description mentions that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon, which points to a highly electronegative element or an element in a high oxidation state. All candidates (interhalogens, p-block elements like Sb, actinides like Pu) can form powerful fluorinating agents. Antimony (Sb) provides an excellent match for the mass percentage. Let's proceed with the hypothesis that Y=Sb and A2=SbF3.\n\n2.  **Identify Compounds A1 and A3.**\n    *   The problem states: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine.\"\n    *   The decomposition A1 -> A2 + F2 implies A1 must be a higher fluoride than A2. The reaction is: `A1 -> SbF3 + F2`. This means A1 must be Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF5. The balanced chemical equation for the decomposition is `SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2`.\n    *   There are conflicts with the description: SbF5 is a colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid, and it's thermally stable at 293 K (room temperature). Chemical problems, especially from competitions, can sometimes contain deliberate inaccuracies or red herrings. Given the excellent numerical fit for Sb, we will proceed assuming these descriptive points are flawed in the problem statement.\n    *   A1 (SbF5) is known to be a very strong Lewis acid and a powerful oxidizing agent that can react with xenon. This fits the description.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and also interacts with xenon. The fluorination of Sb produces SbF3 and SbF5. Since A3 must be a strong enough oxidant to react with xenon, A3 is most likely SbF5 (the same as A1).\n\n3.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5.**\n    *   The core chemical reaction is: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   This is the reaction: `Sb(s) + A4(solution) -> A5` (moles of Sb = moles of A4).\n    *   A4 is a binary fluoride of antimony. The two common ones are SbF3 and SbF5.\n    *   If A4 = SbF5, the reaction is `Sb + SbF5`. This is a comproportionation reaction. The known reaction is `2 Sb + 3 SbF5 -> 5 SbF3`. The stoichiometry is 2:3, not 1:1. So, A4 is likely not SbF5.\n    *   If A4 = SbF3, the reaction is `Sb + SbF3`. This is a reaction between an element and its own lower-oxidation-state halide. While unusual, this can lead to the formation of subhalides or mixed-valence compounds, which is a form of comproportionation (from oxidation states 0 and +3 to an intermediate state). The 1:1 stoichiometry would suggest a product A5 with the formula `Sb2F3`, which has an average oxidation state of +1.5.\n    *   The final clue confirms this: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" Mixed-valence compounds and subhalides are typically unstable in water and disproportionate. For example, the Sb(+1.5) species would disproportionate into stable oxidation states, which for antimony are Sb(0) and Sb(III). The products would be elemental antimony (Sb, substance 1) and an aqueous Sb(III) species (e.g., from the hydrolysis of SbF3, substance 2). This fits the description perfectly.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the most plausible identity for A4 is Antimony(III) fluoride, SbF3.\n    *   Now, we calculate its molecular weight (molar mass).\n    *   M(Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol\n    *   M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   MW(A4) = MW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range.**\n    *   The calculated molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   We compare this value to the given ranges:\n        A) 160-180\n        B) 110-130\n        C) 220-240\n        D) 140-160\n    *   The value 178.76 g/mol falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal Answer seems to be A.\n<<<A>>>"
