    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle. To solve it, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Setup**\n\nThe decay process is: $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\n*   Initial state: A stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$).\n*   Final state: A positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$).\n\nGiven values:\n*   Rest mass of pion, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n*   Rest mass of muon, $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n*   For these calculations, the rest mass of the neutrino ($m_{\\nu}$) is considered to be zero ($m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$).\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   Since the initial pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero ($p_{\\pi} = 0$).\n*   By conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero.\n    $ \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 $\n*   This implies that the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    $ |\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p $\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The total energy before the decay is just the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n    $ E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2 $\n*   The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $ E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} $\n*   By conservation of energy:\n    $ m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} $\n\n**4. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) of a particle are related by the equation:\n$ E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 $\n\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$):\n    $ E_{\\mu}^2 = (p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 $\n\n*   For the neutrino ($\\nu$), since we assume its mass is zero:\n    $ E_{\\nu}^2 = (p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (0)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = p_{\\nu}c = pc $\n\n**5. Solving for the Energies**\n\nWe have a system of equations. We can solve for the unknown momentum `p` or energies. A common method is to find the total energy of one of the massive products first.\n\n1.  From the energy conservation equation: $E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\mu}$\n2.  Since $E_{\\nu} = pc$, we have: $pc = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\mu}$\n3.  Substitute this expression for `pc` into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n    $E_{\\mu}^2 = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\mu})^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n4.  Expand the squared term:\n    $E_{\\mu}^2 = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)E_{\\mu} + E_{\\mu}^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n5.  The $E_{\\mu}^2$ term cancels on both sides. Rearrange to solve for $E_{\\mu}$:\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)E_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $E_{\\mu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate the values using Python.\n\n*   Find the total energy of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$).\n*   Find the kinetic energy of the muon ($KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$).\n*   Find the total energy of the neutrino using energy conservation ($E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\mu}$).\n*   The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its total energy ($KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu}$).\n\n```python\n# Rest masses are given in MeV, so we can treat them as energies (since c=1).\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) using the derived formula.\nE_mu = (m_pi**2 + m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion.\nE_initial = m_pi\n\n# By energy conservation, the neutrino's energy is the remainder.\nE_nu = E_initial - E_mu\n\n# Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is its total energy.\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places.\nprint(f\"KE of muon: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of muon: 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon and approximately 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem deals with the decay of a stationary particle. To solve it, we apply the laws of conservation of energy and momentum within the framework of special relativity.\n\n**1. Principles**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the initial pion ($\\pi^+$) is at rest, its total energy is simply its rest energy.\n    $ E_{initial} = E_{final} $\n    $ m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} $\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero.\n    $ \\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_{final} $\n    $ 0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} $\n    This implies that the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$) must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum ($p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$).\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) of a particle are related by the equation:\n$ E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 $\n\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $ E_{\\mu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 $\n*   For the neutrino ($\\nu$), assuming its rest mass is zero: $ E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc $\n\n**3. Calculation Steps**\n\n1.  From the conservation of energy equation, we can express the neutrino's energy:\n    $ E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\mu} $\n2.  Since $E_{\\nu} = pc$, we can also write:\n    $ pc = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\mu} $\n3.  Substitute this expression for `pc` into the energy-momentum equation for the muon:\n    $ E_{\\mu}^2 = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\mu})^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 $\n4.  Expand and simplify the equation:\n    $ E_{\\mu}^2 = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)E_{\\mu} + E_{\\mu}^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 $\n    $ 0 = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)E_{\\mu} + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 $\n5.  Solve for the total energy of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$):\n    $ 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)E_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 $\n    $ E_{\\mu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)} $\n\n**4. Plugging in the values:**\n\n*   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n*   $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\n*   $ E_{\\mu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 + (105.7)^2}{2(139.6)} = \\frac{19488.16 + 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{30660.65}{279.2} \\approx 109.82 \\text{ MeV} $\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    $ KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2 $\n    $ KE_{\\mu} = 109.82 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 4.12 \\text{ MeV} $\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    First, find the total energy of the neutrino from energy conservation:\n    $ E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\mu} $\n    $ E_{\\nu} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 109.82 \\text{ MeV} = 29.78 \\text{ MeV} $\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    $ KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV} $\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches the values in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
