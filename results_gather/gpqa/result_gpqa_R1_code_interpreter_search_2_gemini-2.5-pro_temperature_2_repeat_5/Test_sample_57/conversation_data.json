    "One of the central challenges in modern physics, particularly in quantum field theory (QFT), is the appearance of infinities when calculating physical quantities. These infinities typically arise from integrals over all possible energies or momenta of virtual particles in loop diagrams, and they are particularly problematic at very high energies (or, equivalently, very short distances). This is known as an \"ultraviolet (UV) divergence\". The mathematical procedure to handle these infinities is called **regularization**, where a parameter (a \"regulator\" or \"cutoff\") is introduced to make the divergent integrals finite. This is then followed by **renormalization**, where these infinities are systematically absorbed into the bare parameters of the theory (like mass and charge), resulting in finite predictions for observable quantities.\n\nLet's analyze the given options in this context:\n\nA) **Classical Electrodynamics**: This theory describes the interactions of electric charges and currents. While it is a classical theory, it is not free from infinities. The most famous example is the self-energy of a point-like electron. If you calculate the energy stored in the electric field of an electron assuming it is a point with zero radius, the result is infinite. To get a finite answer, one must introduce a cutoff, for example, by assuming the electron has a small but non-zero radius. This is a form of regularization.\n\nB) **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. As a QFT, its calculations using perturbation theory are plagued by ultraviolet divergences. Loop diagrams, which represent quantum corrections, lead to infinite results. QED requires regularization (e.g., a momentum cutoff or dimensional regularization) and renormalization to be a predictive theory. It is, in fact, the prototypical example of a renormalizable quantum field theory.\n\nC) **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. Similar to QED, QCD is a QFT that suffers from ultraviolet divergences in its perturbative calculations. It absolutely requires regularization and renormalization to extract meaningful physical predictions.\n\nD) **Superstring Theory**: This theory posits that the fundamental constituents of the universe are not point-like particles but one-dimensional extended objects called \"strings\". A key feature and a primary motivation for string theory is its potential to be a UV-finite theory of quantum gravity. Unlike the point-like interactions in QFT which lead to divergences at short distances, the interactions of strings are \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing effect naturally smooths out the high-energy behavior of the theory, taming the infinities that plague standard QFTs. Loop diagrams in superstring theory are generally found to be finite without the need for an external regularization procedure. The finite size of the string itself acts as a natural ultraviolet cutoff. Therefore, superstring theory is widely believed to be a UV-finite theory that does not require the *ad hoc* step of regularization.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the framework that is believed not to require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
