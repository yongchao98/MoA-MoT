    "This problem requires identifying the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The reaction involves the conjugate addition of an enolate (from the ketone) to an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n2.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and will abstract an acidic α-proton to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons, at the C2 and C6 positions.\n    *   The C2 position is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   The C6 position is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The t-BuOK base will remove the proton from C6, forming a single specific enolate. The mention of steric hindrance with the bulky t-BuOK is relevant, but here, the regiochemistry is dictated by the absence of protons at C2.\n3.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: The acceptor is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester. In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n4.  **Reaction Mechanism**: The enolate formed from the cyclohexanone attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The C6 carbon of the cyclohexanone ring forms a new bond with the terminal CH₂ carbon of the acrylate. After protonation (during workup), the final product is formed.\n5.  **Product Structure and Naming**:\n    *   The substituent `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` is added to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   To name the resulting molecule, we can treat the ethyl propanoate moiety as the parent chain. The substituent attached to C3 of the propanoate chain is the cyclohexyl ring.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature for substituents, the carbon of the ring attached to the parent chain is numbered C1.\n    *   Let's renumber the cyclohexyl ring for naming purposes:\n        *   The original C6 (point of attachment) becomes the new **C1**. This carbon has a methyl group, so we have a **1-methyl** substituent.\n        *   The original C1 (ketone group) becomes the new **C2**. This has the ketone oxygen, so it is **2-oxo**.\n        *   The original C2 becomes the new **C3**. This carbon has both an ethyl and a methyl group, so we have **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl** substituents.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the name of the substituent ring is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The α-protons of a nitroalkane are acidic and can be removed by a base to form a potent nucleophile (a nitronate ion).\n2.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: The donor is 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The base, KOH, removes a proton from the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the –NO₂ group), which is C1 of the propane chain. This forms the nucleophilic carbanion `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n3.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: The acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃−CH=CH−CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the CH carbon that is bonded to the methyl group).\n4.  **Reaction Mechanism**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile. Subsequent protonation of the resulting enolate/nitrile anion intermediate by water yields the final product.\n5.  **Product Structure and Naming**:\n    *   The new bond connects the `CH(NO₂)` from nitropropane to the `CH(CH₃)` from the nitrile. The product structure is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name the product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (–CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   Numbering the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A**: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B**: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nMatching these products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   C) Both A and B are incorrect.\n*   D) Both A and B are correct.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct structures for both products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
