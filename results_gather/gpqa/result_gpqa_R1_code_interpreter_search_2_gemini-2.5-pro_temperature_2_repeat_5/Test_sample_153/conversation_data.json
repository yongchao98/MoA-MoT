    "*   **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This isotopic pattern is highly characteristic of a molecule containing one chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of the `35Cl` (approx. 75%) and `37Cl` (approx. 25%) isotopes.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad absorption spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, this position is typical for the carbonyl group in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (in the 10-13 ppm range) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet (s) because it has no adjacent protons to couple with, and its integration (1H) confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n        *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Another doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent. These two sets of protons are adjacent to each other, so they split each other into doublets.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    1.  **Mass Spec** tells us the molecular weight is 156 and we have one chlorine atom.\n    2.  **IR** and the **11.0 ppm NMR signal** tell us we have a carboxylic acid group.\n    3.  The **aromatic region of the NMR** tells us we have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:** The logical conclusion is a molecule composed of a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom attached at opposite (para, or 1,4) positions. This structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **Verifying the choice with the options:**\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate: An acid chloride, inconsistent with IR and NMR data.\n    *   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: An ortho-substituted ring would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n    *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: An aldehyde, inconsistent with IR (no broad O-H of a carboxylic acid) and NMR (would have an aldehyde proton ~10 ppm, not a carboxylic acid proton at 11 ppm).\n    *   D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: The molecular weight, presence of a chlorine atom, carboxylic acid group, and para-substituted ring pattern all perfectly match the provided spectral data. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>"
