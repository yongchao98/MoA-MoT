    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a relationship between the number of stars, let's call it `N`, and their parallax, `plx`. The relationship is: `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance, `r`. This quantity is the derivative of the number of stars with respect to distance, `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related. The formula is `plx = 1/r`, where `r` is the distance in parsecs and `plx` is the parallax in arcseconds.\n    *   For the purpose of determining proportionality, we can write `plx ∝ 1/r` or, equivalently, `r ∝ 1/plx`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:**\n    *   The given relationship is `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   The term \"the number of stars\" in this context usually refers to the cumulative count of stars up to a certain limit. In this case, `N` would be the total number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to `plx`, which corresponds to all stars within a distance `r = 1/plx`.\n    *   So, we can write the number of stars within a distance `r`, denoted as `N(r)`, by substituting the parallax-distance relationship into the given formula.\n    *   Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have `1/plx ∝ r`.\n    *   Substituting this into the proportionality `N ∝ (1/plx)^5`, we get `N(r) ∝ r^5`.\n    *   This means the total number of stars observed within a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is asking for the rate of change of `N` with respect to `r`, which is the derivative `dN/dr`. This tells us how many stars are found in a thin shell at distance `r`.\n    *   We have the relationship `N(r) ∝ r^5`. Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`: `N(r) = k * r^5`.\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n        `dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n        `dN/dr = 5k * r^4`\n    *   This shows that `dN/dr` is proportional to `r^4`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r^4`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
