    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field `B_initial` in the +Z direction. In quantum mechanics, this means the particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, `S_z`. Specifically, it's in the \"spin up\" state, denoted as `|+z>`. The initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -mu . B = -gamma * S_z * B`. The state `|+z>` is a stationary state of this Hamiltonian.\n\n*   **Sudden Change (t = 0):** The magnetic field is switched from `B * z_hat` to `B * y_hat`. The key principle here is that the state vector of the system does not change instantaneously. So, at `t=0`, the state of the particle is still `|psi(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n*   **Final State (t > 0):** The new magnetic field is `B_final = B * y_hat`. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is `H = -mu . B_final = -gamma * B * S_y`. The initial state `|+z>` is *not* an eigenstate of this new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve in time.\n\n### 2. Time Evolution of the System (Schrödinger Picture)\n\nThe state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n`|psi(t)> = U(t) |psi(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |psi(0)>`\nwhere `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nSubstituting the new Hamiltonian `H = -gamma * B * S_y`:\n`|psi(t)> = exp(-i(-gamma * B * S_y)t / ħ) |+z> = exp(i * gamma * B * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n\nLet's define the Larmor frequency, `omega = gamma * B`.\nThe equation becomes: `|psi(t)> = exp(i * omega * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nWe need to find the expectation value (the average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<mu_z(t)>`.\nSince `mu_z = gamma * S_z`, we need to calculate `<S_z(t)>`.\n`<S_z(t)> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>`\n\nTo perform this calculation, we can use the matrix representations of the spin operators in the z-basis, where `|+z>` is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]^T`:\n`S_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]` (Pauli sigma_z)\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]` (Pauli sigma_y)\n\nThe time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(i * omega * t * S_y / ħ)` becomes:\n`U(t) = exp(i * omega * t * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] / ħ) = exp((omega * t / 2) * [[0, 1], [-1, 0]])`\n\nUsing the property `exp(i * a * sigma_k) = cos(a) * I + i * sin(a) * sigma_k` for Pauli matrices (`sigma_k`), where `a = omega * t / 2` and the operator is `i*sigma_y`, we get:\n`U(t) = cos(omega*t/2) * I + i*sin(omega*t/2) * sigma_y`\n`U(t) = cos(omega*t/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + sin(omega*t/2) * [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]`\n`U(t) = [[cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), cos(omega*t/2)]]`\nThis operator describes a rotation around the y-axis by an angle `omega*t`.\n\nNow, we find the state `|psi(t)>`:\n`|psi(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [[cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), cos(omega*t/2)]] * [1, 0]^T`\n`|psi(t)> = [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)]^T`\n\nFinally, we calculate the expectation value `<S_z(t)>`:\n`<S_z(t)> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>`\n`S_z|psi(t)> = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)]^T = (ħ/2) * [cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)]^T`\n`<psi(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|psi(t)>`, which is `[cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)]`.\n`<S_z(t)> = [cos(omega*t/2), -sin(omega*t/2)] * (ħ/2) * [cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)]^T`\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(omega*t/2) - sin²(omega*t/2))`\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * omega*t/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(omega*t)`\n\n### 4. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of spin is `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(omega*t)`.\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)> = gamma * (ħ/2) * cos(omega*t)`.\n\nThe average value oscillates as `cos(omega*t)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `omega`.\nWe defined `omega = gamma * B`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. A magnetic moment vector that is not aligned with a magnetic field will precess around the field direction with an angular frequency `omega_L = gamma * B`, which is exactly what we found. The projection of the precessing vector onto any fixed axis (other than the precession axis) will oscillate with this frequency.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is `gamma * B`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
