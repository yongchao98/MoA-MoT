    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR signals to identify the molecular fragments.**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A signal for 3 protons that is a singlet is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) with no adjacent protons. The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group, specifically in an acetate functional group (CH3-C(=O)O-).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for one proton in the alkene region (vinyl proton). The high chemical shift suggests it is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electron-withdrawing atom like oxygen (-O-CH=C-). The multiplicity is a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one neighboring proton. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) is a key piece of information. For protons across a double bond, a J-value in the range of 12-18 Hz is indicative of a *trans* relationship.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is also a vinyl proton. The multiplicity \"dq\" means doublet of quartets. This proton is split by one proton into a doublet, and by three other equivalent protons into a quartet. This pattern is characteristic of a proton in a CH3-CH=CH- fragment, where the proton is coupled to both the other vinyl proton and the methyl group protons.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a methyl group (3H) in the allylic position (attached to a double bond). The multiplicity is a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton, which would be the vinyl proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the fragments to determine the overall structure.**\n    *   We have an acetate group (CH3COO-).\n    *   We have a CH3-CH=CH- group. The signals at 5.5 ppm (dq) and 1.6 ppm (d) confirm the CH3-CH= part. The signal at 7.0 ppm (d) is the other =CH proton.\n    *   Connecting these fragments, the structure is CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3. This is propenyl acetate. This rules out the butenyl acetate options (C and A) because a butenyl group would have 7 protons (C4H7), while our non-acetate signals account for 1H + 1H + 3H = 5 protons, which is a propenyl group (C3H5).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry (Cis or Trans).**\n    *   The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons (the signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm).\n    *   The problem states that the doublet at 7.0 ppm has J = 16.0 Hz.\n    *   A typical coupling constant for *trans* vinyl protons is 12-18 Hz.\n    *   A typical coupling constant for *cis* vinyl protons is 6-12 Hz.\n    *   Since J = 16.0 Hz, this unambiguously indicates a *trans* configuration of the double bond.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the identity of the compound.**\n    *   The structure is propenyl acetate.\n    *   The stereochemistry is *trans*.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) Trans-butenyl acetate - Incorrect (wrong alkyl group)\nB) Trans-propenyl acetate - Correct\nC) Cis-butenyl acetate - Incorrect (wrong alkyl group and stereochemistry)\nD) Cis-propenyl acetate - Incorrect (wrong stereochemistry)\n\n<<<B>>>"
