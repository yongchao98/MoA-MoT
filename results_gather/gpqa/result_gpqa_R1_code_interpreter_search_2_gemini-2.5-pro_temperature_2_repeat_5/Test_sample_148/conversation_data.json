    "*   **Analysis of the <sup>1</sup>H NMR Data:** The user observes two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals are roughly equal, summing up to the expected value of one proton. Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out. This phenomenon is characteristic of a sample containing two similar but distinct chemical environments for that specific proton, present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Enantiomers (A) are chemically identical in an achiral environment (like a standard NMR solvent) and would produce a single set of peaks. Thus, they cannot be distinguished by <sup>1</sup>H NMR under these conditions.\n    *   Diastereomers (D) are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties and are distinct chemical species. It is expected that they would give rise to different sets of peaks in an NMR spectrum. If present in a 1:1 ratio, the corresponding peaks would have equal integrals. This perfectly matches the observation. A common source of diastereomers in peptide chemistry is the slow rotation around an amide bond (especially involving proline), leading to cis/trans isomers, which are a form of diastereomeric rotamers (atropisomers). Another possibility is the unintentional use of a racemic amino acid during synthesis in a peptide that already contains other chiral centers.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The analysis shows two separate peaks of equal intensity in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace. The mass spectrometry (MS) data for both peaks is identical and matches the expected mass of the target compound.\n    *   LC separates compounds based on their physical properties (e.g., polarity). Diastereomers (D) have different physical properties and can therefore be separated by standard (achiral) LC, resulting in two distinct peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data. The equal intensities of the LC peaks correspond to the equal integrals observed in the NMR, suggesting a 1:1 mixture. The elevated temperature in the LC-MS might be used to improve peak shape or ensure that if the diastereomers are interconverting rotamers, the separation is still clean on the chromatographic timescale.\n    *   Enantiomers (A) would not separate on a standard (achiral) LC column and would elute as a single peak.\n    *   A precursor contamination (C) or a 'double coupling' product (B) would almost certainly have a different molecular mass, which contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the same, expected mass.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers is the only explanation that consistently accounts for all the experimental observations: two distinct signals of equal size for the same proton in the NMR, and two separable peaks of equal intensity with the same mass in the LC-MS.\n\n<<<D>>>"
