    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field, `f(r)`, over a specific volume `V`.\n    *   The integral is: `I = ∫_V (∇ · f) dV`.\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Define the Vector Field:** The problem states that the vector field `f(r)`:\n    *   Has a magnitude `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`.\n    *   Is directed radially outwards from the origin.\n    In spherical coordinates, this can be written as: `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n3.  **Select the Appropriate Mathematical Tool:** The integral is of the form `∫_V (∇ · f) dV`. This form strongly suggests using the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's theorem). The Divergence Theorem relates a volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to a surface integral of the flux of that field through the closed surface bounding the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ · F) dV = ∮_S (F · dS)`\n    where `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Applicability of the Theorem:**\n    *   The vector field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂` has a singularity at the origin (`r = 0`), where its magnitude becomes infinite.\n    *   The volume of integration, a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin, includes this singularity.\n    *   If we were to calculate the divergence `∇ · f` directly using the formula for spherical coordinates, we would find `∇ · f = 0` for all `r ≠ 0`. However, the divergence is undefined at `r=0`. A naive calculation might incorrectly lead to the integral being zero.\n    *   The correct way to handle this singularity is to apply the Divergence Theorem, which relates the volume integral to the flux through the boundary surface `S`. The field `f(r)` is well-behaved on this surface (as long as `R > 0`).\n\n5.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    *   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   `F` is our vector field `f(r)`.\n    So, we need to calculate the surface integral: `∮_S (f · dS)`.\n\n6.  **Set up the Surface Integral:**\n    *   On the surface `S` of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. Therefore, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface area vector `dS` for a sphere points in the radially outward direction. So, `dS = dS * r̂`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the differential area element.\n    *   In spherical coordinates, the differential surface area element is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    *   So, the vector area element is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Dot Product `f · dS`:**\n    *   `f · dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] · [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂ ]`\n    *   The dot product of the unit vector with itself is `r̂ · r̂ = 1`.\n    *   The `R^2` terms cancel out.\n    *   `f · dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * (r̂ · r̂) = sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Integral:** Now, we integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    *   `∮_S (f · dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   This is a separable integral: `( ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ ) * ( ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ )`\n    *   Evaluate the first integral (over `φ`): `∫(from 0 to 2π) dφ = [φ]_(from 0 to 2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`.\n    *   Evaluate the second integral (over `θ`): `∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_(from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Multiply the results: `Flux = 2π * 2 = 4π`.\n\n9.  **Final Conclusion:** According to the Divergence Theorem, the value of the original volume integral is equal to the value of this surface integral.\n    *   `∫_V (∇ · f) dV = 4π`.\n\nThis result is a fundamental concept in physics, particularly in electrostatics, where it's known as Gauss's Law for a point charge at the origin. The value `4π` represents the total \"source strength\" contained within the sphere, which is concentrated at the singularity at the origin.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 0\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
