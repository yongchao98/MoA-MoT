    "Here is the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The decay of unstable particles is described by an exponential decay law. The number of particles `N(t)` remaining at time `t` from an initial sample `N_0` is given by:\n    `N(t) = N_0 * exp(-t / τ_mean)`\n    where `τ_mean` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where time `t` is measured (in this case, the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Apply Special Relativity (Time Dilation):**\n    The mean lifetime of the particles is different in their own rest frame (proper lifetime, `τ`) and the laboratory frame (`τ_lab`). Due to time dilation, the lifetime measured in the lab is longer:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time of Flight:**\n    The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30 m`. They travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, meaning their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall is:\n    `t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combine the Concepts to Formulate an Equation:**\n    The fraction of particles that reach the detector wall is the ratio `N(t_flight) / N_0`. We can substitute the expressions for `t_flight` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation:\n    `Fraction = N(t_flight) / N_0 = exp(-t_flight / τ_lab) = exp(- (R/c) / (γ * τ) )`\n\n5.  **Analyze the First Scenario:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_1 = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall = `1/3`.\n    Plugging these values into our equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(- (R/c) / (20 * τ) )`\n    To solve for the unknown constant term `(R/c)/τ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = - (R/c) / (20 * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = - (R/c) / (20 * τ)`\n    `ln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ)` (Equation 1)\n\n6.  **Analyze the Second Scenario:**\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall = `2/3`.\n    *   The new Lorentz factor `γ_2` is what we need to find.\n    Plugging these values into our equation:\n    `2/3 = exp(- (R/c) / (γ_2 * τ) )`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = - (R/c) / (γ_2 * τ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = - (R/c) / (γ_2 * τ)`\n    `ln(1.5) = (R/c) / (γ_2 * τ)` (Equation 2)\n\n7.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ_2):**\n    We now have a system of two equations. We can see that the term `(R/c)/τ` is a constant related to the detector size and the particle's proper lifetime.\n    From Equation 1: `(R/c)/τ = 20 * ln(3)`\n    From Equation 2: `(R/c)/τ = γ_2 * ln(1.5)`\n    Since both expressions are equal to `(R/c)/τ`, we can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ_2 * ln(1.5) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    Now, solve for `γ_2`:\n    `γ_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    To get the final answer, we compute the value of the expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial Lorentz factor\ngamma1 = 20\n\n# We need to find the new Lorentz factor (gamma2)\n# The relationship is derived in the reasoning above:\n# gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n\ngamma2 = gamma1 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.18040188825852\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18. Looking at the options, 54 is the closest value.\n\nA) 28\nB) 40\nC) 54\nD) 68\n\nThe calculated value `~54.18` is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem relates the survival fraction of decaying particles to their Lorentz factor. Let's break it down.\n\n**1. Survival Probability Formula**\n\nThe probability `P` that a particle survives for a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n`P = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\nwhere `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\n**2. Time Dilation**\n\nDue to special relativity, the lifetime measured in the lab (`τ_lab`) is longer than the particle's proper lifetime (`τ`) by a factor of `γ` (the Lorentz factor):\n`τ_lab = γ * τ`\n\nSubstituting this into the survival probability formula gives:\n`P = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n\n**3. Time of Flight**\n\nThe particles travel from the center of the detector to the inner wall, a distance `R`. Since they travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight `t` is:\n`t ≈ R / c`\n\nSubstituting this time of flight into the survival probability equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\n`P = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n\nWe can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ` into a single constant `K = (R/c) / τ`. The formula simplifies to:\n`P = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**4. Solving for the Unknowns**\n\nWe are given two scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_1 = 20`\n    *   Survival probability `P_1 = 1/3`\n\n    Plugging these in:\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor `γ_2`.\n    *   The desired survival probability is `P_2 = 2/3`.\n\n    Plugging these into the formula with the value of `K` we just found:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ_2)`\n\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ_2`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ_2`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ_2`\n    `ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ_2`\n\n    Now, we rearrange to solve for `γ_2`:\n    `γ_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nLet's compute the value for `γ_2`. We know that `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n`γ_2 ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ_2 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. Looking at the multiple-choice options, the closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
