    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial reaction to form product 1.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a derivative of norbornadiene) and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of the complex dibromo compound with NaI is characteristic of an in-situ generation of a reactive intermediate for a cycloaddition reaction. The reaction of tetrabromo compounds with NaI can produce reactive dienes. Norbornadiene is an excellent dienophile. The overall reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The use of \"2 equivalents\" of the diene precursor indicates that both double bonds of the norbornadiene starting material react. This is a common strategy to 'protect' the double bonds while performing chemistry on another part of the molecule.\n*   **Product 1:** A double Diels-Alder adduct is formed. The norbornadiene's two double bonds are saturated, and two new ring systems (derived from the diene) are fused to the norbornane skeleton. The exact structure of the added diene is complex, but its precise identity is not required for the subsequent steps, as it will be removed later. Product **1** is the resulting bis-adduct which still has the 7-(tert-butoxy) group.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acidic condition for the cleavage of a tert-butyl ether protecting group. The 7-(tert-butoxy) group is hydrolyzed to a 7-hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Product 2:** The skeleton is unchanged from **1**, but the ether is converted to a secondary alcohol.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **2** is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Analysis:** This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild set of reagents used to oxidize primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The secondary alcohol at position 7 in product **2** is oxidized to a ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The bis-adduct now contains a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C7 position of the central norbornane skeleton.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the final product 4.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **3** is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Analysis:** The Diels-Alder reaction is reversible. Heating a Diels-Alder adduct can cause a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, regenerating the original diene and dienophile. Heating the bis-adduct **3** will cause both fused rings to be removed, regenerating two molecules of the diene 'D' and the modified dienophile core.\n*   **Intermediate Product:** The dienophile core that is regenerated is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one (often called norbornadienone). This molecule is known to be highly unstable.\n*   **Rearrangement:** At the reaction temperature of 150°C, the unstable bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one undergoes a thermal rearrangement. While several pathways exist, a known and plausible rearrangement product for this molecule is benzaldehyde (C₇H₆O), which is a stable aromatic compound. The reaction proceeds through a series of pericyclic reactions.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The final, stable product **4** is benzaldehyde.\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Benzaldehyde).**\n\n*   **Structure:** Benzaldehyde consists of a benzene ring substituted with an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the aldehyde group and bisects the benzene ring.\n*   **Hydrogen Environments:** Due to this symmetry, we can identify four distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n    1.  The single aldehyde proton (-CH=O).\n    2.  The two ortho protons (adjacent to the aldehyde group). They are chemically equivalent to each other.\n    3.  The two meta protons. They are chemically equivalent to each other.\n    4.  The single para proton. It is unique.\n\nIn total, there are 4 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
