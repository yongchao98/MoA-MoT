    "This question requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths (MFP) in the same environment. Let's break down the physics behind each.\n\n**1. Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1):**\n\n*   This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n*   This is described by the kinetic theory of gases. The formula for the mean free path (λ) of a molecule in a gas composed of identical molecules is:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n*   Where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas-gas molecule collision. This is effectively the \"target area\" one molecule presents to another. For a simple hard-sphere model, this is `πd²`, where `d` is the diameter of a gas molecule.\n    *   The `√2` factor is crucial; it accounts for the fact that all gas molecules are moving relative to each other, which increases the probability of collision compared to a scenario with a moving particle and stationary targets.\n\n**2. Mean Free Path of Electrons in Gas (λ2):**\n\n*   This refers to the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n*   The scenario is different: we have very light, very high-energy projectiles (1000 keV electrons) moving through a collection of nearly stationary, much heavier targets (gas molecules).\n*   The formula for the mean free path in this case is:\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n*   Where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron-gas molecule collision.\n    *   The `√2` factor is absent because we can approximate the gas molecules as stationary targets relative to the extremely fast electrons from the beam.\n\n**Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n\nTo compare them, we need to compare `√2 * σ_gg` with `σ_eg`.\n\n1.  **Collision Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is based on the physical size of the gas molecule. Let's think of it as approximately `πd²`.\n2.  **Scattering Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This is more complex. It's not just about physical size. The 1000 kV electrons are highly energetic and relativistic. Such high-energy particles are extremely penetrating. They interact with the gas molecule's electromagnetic field, but because they pass by so quickly, the probability of a significant scattering event (a \"collision\") is very low. The gas molecule is much more \"transparent\" to a fast electron than it is to another gas molecule. Therefore, the effective target area, `σ_eg`, is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section, `σ_gg`.\n    *   `σ_eg` << `σ_gg`\n\n**Deriving the Relationship:**\n\nLet's look at the ratio of the mean free paths:\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nSince we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a large number (much greater than 1).\nTherefore, `λ₂ / λ₁` is not only greater than 1, but it is much greater than 1.\n\n**Let's use a simple \"hard sphere\" model as an estimate:**\n*   Collision between two molecules of diameter `d`: The effective collision diameter is `d`, so σ_gg = πd².\n*   Collision between a point-like electron and a molecule of diameter `d` (radius `r = d/2`): The effective collision radius is `r`, so σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = πd²/4.\n*   In this simplified model, `σ_gg / σ_eg` = 4.\n*   This gives: λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * 4 ≈ 1.414 * 4 = 5.656.\n*   So, even this highly simplified model predicts `λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁`. In reality, due to the high energy of the electrons, the scattering cross-section `σ_eg` is even smaller, making the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` even larger.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mean free path of the high-energy electrons (λ₂) is significantly larger than the mean free path of the gas molecules colliding with each other (λ₁).\n`λ₂ >> λ₁`\n\nNow, let's check the options:\nA) λ2 < λ1 -> Incorrect.\nB) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> Incorrect. The ratio λ₂/λ₁ is much larger than 1.22.\nC) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation -> Incorrect. The physics are different, so the values are not expected to be equal.\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> Correct. Since we have robustly concluded that `λ₂` is much larger than `λ₁` (at least by a factor of ~5.6), it is certainly greater than 1.22 times `λ₁`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
