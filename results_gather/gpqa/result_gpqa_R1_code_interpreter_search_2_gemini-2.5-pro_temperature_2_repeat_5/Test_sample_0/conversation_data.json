    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Fundamental Principle:** The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the inherent uncertainty in its energy. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) must be greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2.\n    \n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    \n    In this context, the lifetime of the state (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) represents the \"width\" or \"spread\" of the energy level. It's often referred to as the natural linewidth (Γ). A common approximation for the minimum uncertainty, or linewidth, is:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Define the Condition for Resolution:** For two distinct energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the energy difference between them, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their energy uncertainties. If the energy difference is smaller than the linewidth of either state, their energy distributions will overlap significantly, making them impossible to distinguish. The state with the shorter lifetime will have a larger energy uncertainty (a broader linewidth), and this larger width is the primary limiting factor for resolution.\n\n    Therefore, the condition for resolvability is:\n    \n    |E1 - E2| > max(ΔE1, ΔE2)\n\n4.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   **For state 1:** It has the shorter lifetime (τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s), so it will have the larger energy uncertainty.\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For state 2:**\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n6.  **Apply the Resolvability Condition:**\n    The larger of the two uncertainties is ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, to clearly resolve the two states, the energy difference between them must be significantly greater than this value.\n    \n    |E1 - E2| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\n    Now, compare each option with the required minimum separation of ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This energy difference is large enough.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is too small.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is too small.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is too small.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Only option A provides an energy separation large enough to overcome the natural linewidth of the states, particularly the broader state (state 1), allowing them to be clearly resolved.\n\nI will use Python code to perform the calculations precisely and verify the conclusion.\n```python\n# Constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the relation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The state with the shorter lifetime (tau1) will have the larger energy uncertainty.\n# This larger uncertainty is the limiting factor for resolving the two states.\nlimiting_uncertainty = delta_E1\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 1: {tau1} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 2: {tau2} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"To be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the larger uncertainty.\")\nprint(f\"Required energy difference > {limiting_uncertainty:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Checking the options:\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-4,\n    \"B\": 1e-8,\n    \"C\": 1e-9,\n    \"D\": 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"Comparing the required difference with the given options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    comparison = \">\" if value > limiting_uncertainty else \"<=\"\n    resolvable = \"Sufficiently large for resolution\" if value > limiting_uncertainty else \"Too small for resolution\"\n    print(f\"Option {option}: {value:.1e} eV {comparison} {limiting_uncertainty:.3e} eV  => {resolvable}\")\n\n```\n>>> Lifetime of state 1: 1e-09 s\nEnergy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nLifetime of state 2: 1e-08 s\nEnergy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\n------------------------------\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the larger uncertainty.\nRequired energy difference > 6.582e-07 eV\n------------------------------\nComparing the required difference with the given options:\nOption A: 1.0e-04 eV > 6.582e-07 eV  => Sufficiently large for resolution\nOption B: 1.0e-08 eV <= 6.582e-07 eV  => Too small for resolution\nOption C: 1.0e-09 eV <= 6.582e-07 eV  => Too small for resolution\nOption D: 1.0e-11 eV <= 6.582e-07 eV  => Too small for resolution\n\n<<<A>>>",

My task is to interpret this output and provide the final, concise answer.\n\n2.  **Review the Code's Logic (Recap):** The code was designed to solve the problem by:\n    *   Defining the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Taking the given lifetimes of the two quantum states (10⁻⁹ s and 10⁻⁸ s).\n    *   Calculating the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula: ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n    *   Identifying the *larger* of the two uncertainties, as this is the limiting factor for resolving the two energy levels.\n    *   Stating the condition for resolvability: The energy difference between the states must be greater than this limiting uncertainty.\n    *   Comparing the given options (A, B, C, D) with the calculated minimum required energy difference.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Code Output:**\n    *   The code correctly calculates the energy uncertainty for the first state (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s) as ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   It calculates the uncertainty for the second state (τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s) as ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   The output correctly identifies that the larger uncertainty (the limiting one) is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   The crucial conclusion from the code is: `Required energy difference > 6.582e-07 eV`.\n    *   The code then checks each option against this requirement:\n        *   **Option A (10⁻⁴ eV):** Is greater than the required minimum.

This problem is governed by the energy-time Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which can be stated as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δτ ≥ ħ/2\n\nHere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state. This can be thought of as the \"width\" or \"linewidth\" of the energy level.\n*   Δτ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their individual energy uncertainties. A common criterion is that the energy difference should be at least as large as the broader of the two linewidths.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state.**\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty, which will be the limiting factor for resolution.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference required for resolution.**\n\nThe larger of the two uncertainties is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, to clearly resolve the two states, the energy difference between them must be greater than this value.\n\n|E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**Step 3: Compare this requirement with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is a possible value.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is too small.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is too small.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is too small.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation that is sufficiently large to resolve the two states, given the large energy width of the shorter-lived state.\n\n<<<A>>>"
