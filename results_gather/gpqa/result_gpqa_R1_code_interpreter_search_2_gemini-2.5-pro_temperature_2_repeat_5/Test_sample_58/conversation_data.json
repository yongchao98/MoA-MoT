    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The approach involves stoichiometry to determine which species are in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each species:**\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   HCl dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol HCl\n    *   This provides 0.08 mol of H+ ions.\n\n*   **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH-\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-, the total moles of OH- are: 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol OH-.\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will first react with the strong acid (H+ from HCl), and then any remaining base will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Reaction between strong acid and strong base:**\n    *   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles H+ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- = 0.18 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, the H+ will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n*   **Step 2b: Reaction between remaining strong base and weak acid:**\n    *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH- than CH3COOH, the CH3COOH will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the final pH:**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-). The pH of the solution will be determined by this excess OH-.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Step 3c: Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Step 3d: Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nLet's use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1\nmoles_hcl = 0.400 * 0.2\nmoles_ba_oh2 = 0.300 * 0.3\nmoles_oh = 2 * moles_ba_oh2\n\n# Step 2: Neutralization reactions\nmoles_h_plus_strong = moles_hcl\nmoles_oh_after_strong_acid = moles_oh - moles_h_plus_strong\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_strong_acid - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 3: Calculate pH from excess strong base\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nconc_oh_excess = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\npoh = -math.log10(conc_oh_excess)\nph = 14 - poh\n\nprint(f'{ph=:.2f}')\n```\n<execute_result>\nph=12.62\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Their Nature**\nThe solution is a mixture of:\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** A weak acid.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** A strong acid, which fully dissociates into H⁺ and Cl⁻ ions.\n*   **Ba(OH)₂ (Barium Hydroxide):** A strong base, which fully dissociates into Ba²⁺ and 2 OH⁻ ions.\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Moles of Acid and Base**\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of the acidic protons (H⁺) and the basic hydroxide ions (OH⁻) before any reaction occurs.\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol CH₃COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, moles of H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since each Ba(OH)₂ provides two OH⁻ ions, the moles of OH⁻ = 0.09 mol × 2 = 0.18 mol\n\n**3. Perform the Neutralization Reactions**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acid. It neutralizes the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first, and any remaining OH⁻ will then neutralize the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Step 3a: Reaction between Strong Acid and Strong Base**\n    *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n    *   The strong acid is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n*   **Step 3b: Reaction between Weak Acid and Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.10 mol\n    *   The weak acid is the limiting reactant here. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**4. Determine the Final pH**\nThe reaction vessel now contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The presence of the strong base will dominate the pH of the solution.\n\n*   **Step 4a: Calculate the total volume of the final solution.**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Step 4b: Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻.**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate the pOH.**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Step 4d: Calculate the pH.**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
