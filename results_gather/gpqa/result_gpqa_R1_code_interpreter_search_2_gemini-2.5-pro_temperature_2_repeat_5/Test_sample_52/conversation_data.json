    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group. A benzene ring contributes 4 degrees of unsaturation (one for the ring and three for the double bonds).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR:** The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl (C=O) double bond. This C=O bond adds 1 degree of unsaturation to the molecule.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It eliminates possibilities like ethyl groups (-CH2CH3), propyl groups, etc., which contain methylene (-CH2-) protons.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Ester and CH3 signals:** Since we have an ester group and no -CH2- groups, one of the -CH3 signals must belong to either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetoxy group (-O-CO-CH3). In both cases, this fragment contributes the atoms C2H3O2 to the final formula.\n    *   **Vinyl-H and the second CH3 signal:** The spectrum shows two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) with specific splitting: one is a doublet (d) and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   A doublet means the proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   A doublet of quartets means the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n        *   This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**. The proton on the carbon with the methyl group is the 'dq' signal (split by the other vinyl H and the CH3), and the other vinyl H is the 'd' signal (split only by the first vinyl H). The CH3 group attached to the double bond accounts for the second -CH3 signal mentioned. This propenyl substituent contributes C3H5 to the formula and adds 1 degree of unsaturation (for the C=C bond).\n    *   **Aromatic-H signals:** There are two signals for the aromatic protons. In a di-substituted benzene ring, this pattern typically arises from para (1,4) substitution when the two substituents are electronically different, which is the case here (an ester-containing group and a propenyl group).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** Based on the structural features identified, the total DoU should be:\n    *   4 (from the benzene ring) + 1 (from the C=C in the propenyl group) + 1 (from the C=O in the ester group) = **6**.\n    We can use this required DoU to check the validity of the given formula options. The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2`.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Molecular Formula:** Now, let's sum the atoms from the identified pieces:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Ester fragment with a methyl group (e.g., -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3): C2H3O2\n    *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): C3H5\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms:** 6 + 2 + 3 = 11\n    *   **Total Hydrogen atoms:** 4 + 3 + 5 = 12\n    *   **Total Oxygen atoms:** 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify the Options:**\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the derived formula C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. This matches our structural requirement.\n    *   Now let's check the DoU for all given options to see which ones are plausible.\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a molecular formula.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    # Extract atoms and their counts\n    atom_counts = {atom: int(count) if count else 1 for atom, count in re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d*)', formula_str)}\n    C = atom_counts.get('C', 0)\n    H = atom_counts.get('H', 0)\n    N = atom_counts.get('N', 0)\n    X = 0 # Halogens\n    \n    # DoU formula\n    dou = C - (H / 2) - (X / 2) + (N / 2) + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\noptions = {\n    'A': 'C12H12O2',\n    'B': 'C11H12O2',\n    'C': 'C11H14O2',\n    'D': 'C12H14O2'\n}\n\nprint(\"Expected DoU from structure = 6\")\nfor option, formula in options.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}): DoU = {dou}\")\n```\n>>>\nExpected DoU from structure = 6\nOption A (C12H12O2): DoU = 7\nOption B (C11H12O2): DoU = 6\nOption C (C11H14O2): DoU = 5\nOption D (C12H14O2): DoU = 6\n>>>\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The code output shows that options A and C have the wrong degree of unsaturation (DoU) and can be eliminated.\n    *   We are left with options B (C11H12O2) and D (C12H14O2), both of which have the correct DoU of 6.\n    *   Our detailed structural analysis based on the NMR fragments consistently led to the formula **C11H12O2**.\n    *   The formula C12H14O2 (Option D) differs from our derived formula by a CH2 unit. The presence of a CH2 unit would produce a signal in the 1H NMR spectrum. However, the problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**. This directly contradicts option D.\n    *   Therefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning process has led to a conclusive answer.\n\n1.  **Structural Analysis from Spectroscopy**:\n    *   **Core**: A di-substituted benzene ring implies a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR**: An ester group (-COO-) is present. This group adds one degree of unsaturation (DoU) due to the C=O double bond.\n    *   **¹H NMR**:\n        *   \"No signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is a key constraint, eliminating any ethyl, propyl, etc., fragments.\n        *   \"Two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" indicates two distinct methyl groups.\n        *   \"Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" and one of the -CH₃ signals is the classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This substituent accounts for one vinyl H, another vinyl H, and one -CH₃ group. The fragment formula is C₃H₅. This adds another DoU from the C=C bond.\n        *   The ester group and the second -CH₃ group must form a fragment without any -CH₂- groups. The two possibilities are an **acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃)** or a **methyl ester group (-COOCH₃)**. Both have the fragment formula C₂H₃O₂.\n        *   \"Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" suggests the substituents on the C₆H₄ ring are likely in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\n2.  **Formula Assembly**:\n    *   Let's add up the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   Benzene ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester/methyl fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Total Formula**: (C₆ + C₃ + C₂) + (H₄ + H₅ + H₃) + O₂ = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**\n\n3.  **Verification with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**:\n    *   From the derived structure, the expected DoU is: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (C=C in propenyl) + 1 (C=O in ester) = **6**.\n    *   The provided code output confirms the DoU calculations for the options:\n        *   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 7 (Incorrect)\n        *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 6 (**Correct**)\n        *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 5 (Incorrect)\n        *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 6 (**Potentially Correct**)\n\n4.  **Final Elimination**:\n    *   We are left with two options that have the correct DoU of 6: B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n    *   Our structural analysis based on assembling the fragments from the NMR data unambiguously led to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option D) contains one additional carbon and two additional hydrogens (a CH₂ unit) compared to C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Any plausible structure for C₁₂H₁₄O₂ that still aligns with the other NMR data would almost certainly require a -CH₂- group (e.g., an ethyl ester instead of a methyl ester), which is explicitly ruled out by the problem statement (\"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\").\n    *   Therefore, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the only formula that fits all the given information.\n\n<<<B>>>"
