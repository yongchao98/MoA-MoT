    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total_1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_2). This ratio represents the factor by which system_1 is more (or less) massive than system_2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** The total mass of a spectroscopic binary star system is related to its orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of its component stars (K1 and K2). The formula derived from Kepler's Third Law is:\n    M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n    where:\n    *   M_total is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   K1 and K2 are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   'i' is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Use Key Information from the Problem:** The problem states that both systems \"exhibit eclipses\". This is crucial information because eclipses only occur when we view the system nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle 'i' is very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. We can make this simplification for both systems.\n\n4.  **Set up the Mass Ratio:** We want to calculate the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₁)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₂)) ]\n\n5.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   The term (2 * π * G) is a constant and cancels out.\n    *   Since both are eclipsing systems, we assume i₁ ≈ i₂ ≈ 90°, so sin³(i₁) ≈ sin³(i₂) ≈ 1. These terms also cancel out.\n    The simplified ratio becomes:\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\n6.  **Gather the Data:**\n    *   **System 1:** P1 = 2 years, K1a = 10 km/s, K1b = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:** P2 = 1 year, K2a = 15 km/s, K2b = 10 km/s\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system:\n        *   K_sum_1 = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n        *   K_sum_2 = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   Substitute the values into the simplified ratio formula.\n\nLet's use a Python script for precise calculation.\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0 # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2a = 15.0 # km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_sum_1 = K1a + K1b\nK_sum_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods\nP_ratio = P1 / P2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the summed velocity amplitudes\nK_sum_ratio = K_sum_1 / K_sum_2\n\n# Calculate the final mass ratio\nmass_ratio = P_ratio * (K_sum_ratio)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\n\nThe result of the calculation is 0.432. This value is approximately 0.4.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 0.7\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nThe calculated factor of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M_total_1 / M_total_2).\n\n**1. Underlying Physics and Formula**\n\nThe total mass of a spectroscopic binary star system can be determined using a form of Kepler's Third Law:\nM_total = M1 + M2 = P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\nwhere:\n-   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n-   `P` is the orbital period.\n-   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n-   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n-   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n**2. Key Simplification**\n\nThe problem states that both systems \"exhibit eclipses\". This is crucial because eclipses are only observable when the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, we have sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. We can apply this simplification to both systems.\n\n**3. Setting up the Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2. Let's write out the ratio of the masses using the formula:\nRatio = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ / (2πG * sin³(i₁)) ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ / (2πG * sin³(i₂)) ]\n\nSince the term `(2πG)` is a constant, and we assume `sin³(i₁) ≈ sin³(i₂) ≈ 1`, these terms cancel out. The simplified formula for the ratio is:\nRatio = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\n**4. Data Extraction**\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1a = 10 km/s\n    *   K1b = 5 km/s\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2a = 15 km/s\n    *   K2b = 10 km/s\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nLet's plug these values into our simplified ratio formula:\n*   Sum of velocities for System 1 (K1a + K1b) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities for System 2 (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow substitute into the ratio equation:\nRatio = (2 years / 1 year) * [ (15 km/s) / (25 km/s) ]³\nRatio = 2 * (15/25)³\nRatio = 2 * (3/5)³\nRatio = 2 * (0.6)³\nRatio = 2 * 0.216\nRatio = 0.432\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated mass ratio of system_1 to system_2 is 0.432. This means system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2 (or, system_2 is more massive). Comparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 0.7\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
