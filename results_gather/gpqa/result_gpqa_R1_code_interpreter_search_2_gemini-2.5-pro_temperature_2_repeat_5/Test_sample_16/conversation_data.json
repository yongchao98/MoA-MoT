    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex solution.\n\n1.  **Reaction and Equilibrium Constant:**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by the reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The formation constant ($K_f$) for this reaction is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    To find the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions, we need to consider the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **ICE Table Setup:**\n    We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n    | Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    |-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n    | $[CaY]^{2-}$      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n    | $Ca^{2+}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n    | $Y^{4-}$          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The problem states the pH is \"ideal\", which simplifies the problem by allowing us to assume that all the free EDTA is in the fully deprotonated form ($Y^{4-}$). Therefore, the concentration of free calcium ions equals the concentration of free EDTA ions, $[Ca^{2+}] = [Y^{4-}] = x$.\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Calculation:**\n    Now, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n4.  **Approximation:**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium heavily favors the formation of the complex. This means the dissociation will be minimal, and 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    We can therefore make the approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n5.  **Solve for x:**\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    Rearranging to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    Now we solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n\nWe can use Python for a precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# Solving for x in the equation: x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{x:.1e}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The code successfully calculated the concentration of calcium ions, which is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option D.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  The dissociation reaction is $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$.\n2.  The equilibrium constant for formation is $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$.\n3.  Initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of dissociated $Ca^{2+}$.\n4.  At equilibrium, $[Ca^{2+}] = [Y^{4-}] = x$, and $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$.\n5.  $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n6.  Since $K_f$ is very large, x is very small. We approximate $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n7.  $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$.\n8.  $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$.\n9.  $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \\times \\sqrt{10^{-1}} \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 2 \\times 0.316 \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 0.632 \\times 10^{-6} = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThe calculation confirms the result from the Python code. The concentration of calcium ions is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
