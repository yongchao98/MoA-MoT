The initial energy is the rest-mass energy of `M`. The final energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the fragments.\n    *   `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   `E_final = m1*c^2 + T1 + m2*c^2 + T2`.\n    *   `Mc^2 = (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) + (T1 + T2)`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy `T_total = T1 + T2` is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n    *   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate `T1` using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   Momentum is conserved. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. The final total momentum must also be zero. This means the fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n    *   `p1 = p2 = p`.\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   Therefore, `T1 = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n    *   The ratio of kinetic energies is: `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n    *   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, we have `T1 / T2 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n    *   This gives `T2 = 2*T1`.\n    *   We know `T1 + T2 = T_total = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `T2`: `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV => 3*T1 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   So, the classical value is `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics:**\n    *   Momentum conservation still holds: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n    *   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2`. We can write this as `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2`.\n    *   The total energy `E` of a particle is the sum of its rest-mass energy `m_0c^2` and kinetic energy `T`: `E = T + m_0c^2`.\n    *   Substituting this into the momentum equation: `(pc)^2 = (T + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m_0c^2`.\n    *   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate `(pc)^2` for each:\n        *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2`\n    *   We know `T2 = T_total - T1 = 3 - T1`. Let's substitute this and the rest-mass energy values (`m1c^2 = 198` GeV, `m2c^2 = 99` GeV):\n        *   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * 198 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * 99`\n        *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n        *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n    *   The `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n        *   `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n        *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n        *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   Solving for `T1`:\n        *   `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    *   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nMc2_GeV = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest mass energies of the fragments in GeV\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M  => 3*m2 = 0.99*M => m2 = 0.33*M, m1 = 0.66*M\nm1c2_GeV = 0.66 * Mc2_GeV\nm2c2_GeV = 0.33 * Mc2_GeV\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy released (Q-value) in GeV\nQ_GeV = Mc2_GeV - (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Calculate classical T1 in GeV\n# From T1/T2 = m2/m1 and T1+T2 = Q\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV / 3.0\n\n# Calculate relativistic T1 in GeV\n# From T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2 and T2 = Q - T1\n# which simplifies to T1 * (2*Mc2) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)\nT1_relativistic_GeV = (Q_GeV * (Q_GeV + 2 * m2c2_GeV)) / (2 * Mc2_GeV)\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV) * 1000.0\n\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic_GeV:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical_GeV:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n```\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV.

    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **1. Initial Setup and Given Information**\n*   An atomic nucleus is initially at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   It fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   `m1` is the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nWe can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n2.  Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   **Massive fragment (m1):** `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Lighter fragment (m2):** `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe total kinetic energy (`Q`) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = E_initial - E_final_rest = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using the Classical Approximation**\nBy conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nTaking the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / 2m1) / (p^2 / 2m2) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   **`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`**\n\n### **5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Value of T1**\nAgain, we use the conservation of momentum `p1 = p2 = p`. The relativistic relationship between energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m0` is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m0c^2)^2`.\n\nFrom this, `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m0c^2)^2`. Since the total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m0c^2` (`E = T + m0c^2`), we can write:\n*   `(pc)^2 = (T + m0c^2)^2 - (m0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m0c^2`\n\nSince `p` is the same for both fragments:\n*   `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2`\n\nWe substitute `T2 = 3 GeV - T1` and the rest-mass energy values (`m1c^2 = 198` GeV, `m2c^2 = 99` GeV):\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n*   `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   **`T1_correct = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`**\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   `Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
