    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. However, chirality can also arise from other features like axial chirality in atropisomers or planar chirality, even in the absence of a chiral carbon atom. A key test for achirality (the opposite of chirality) is the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in the molecule. If a molecule has either of these symmetry elements, it is achiral and will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analyzing each compound:**\n\n    **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This can lead to a type of axial chirality known as atropisomerism, where the non-planar conformations are stable and can be isolated as separate isomers.\n    *   The substituents at the ortho-positions are nitro groups (-NO2) and methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). Both are sufficiently bulky to prevent free rotation around the C1-C1' bond.\n    *   To be chiral, the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   Let's examine the structure. The substituents on ring 1 are -COOCH3 at C2 and -NO2 at C6. The substituents on ring 2 are -COOCH3 at C2' and -NO2 at C6'.\n    *   Due to the restricted rotation, the rings are twisted relative to each other and are not in the same plane.\n    *   In this twisted conformation, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. A plane bisecting the molecule would require one half to be the mirror image of the other, which is not possible due to the twist and the specific substitution pattern.\n    *   The molecule also lacks a center of inversion. An inversion through the center point would not map identical groups onto each other (e.g., the -COOCH3 group at C2 would not map onto another -COOCH3 group at the corresponding inverted position).\n    *   Since the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, it is chiral. Therefore, it will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and will show optical isomerism.\n\n    **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structural formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's analyze the carbon atom at position 2 (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (a methyl carboxylate group)\n    *   Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    **3. benzophenone:**\n    *   The structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized, and all carbons in the phenyl rings are part of double bonds or are bonded to at least two other carbons within the ring.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n\n    **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is based on a carbon-carbon double bond with the two methyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups in a *trans* configuration.\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you draw a line from any atom through this central point and extend it an equal distance on the other side, you will find an identical atom.\n    *   The presence of a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, compound 1 (due to axial chirality/atropisomerism) and compound 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n    Therefore, the correct choice includes only compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
