    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem asks for a decay route and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the initial state |n,l,m⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ (3s state) to the final state |1,0,0⟩ (1s state) via two electric dipole transitions.\n\n2.  **Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules:** The selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition are:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n\n3.  **Determine the decay path:** The decay involves two steps, meaning there must be an intermediate state.\n    *   **First transition:** |3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩\n        *   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n        *   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm=0,±1, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   For a decay, the principal quantum number must decrease, so n' < 3. The lowest possible energy level with l'=1 is n'=2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        *   The initial state has l'=1. The final state has l_f=0. This satisfies Δl = 0 - 1 = -1.\n        *   The initial state can have m'=-1, 0, or 1. The final state has m_f=0.\n            *   If m'=-1, Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1 (allowed).\n            *   If m'=0, Δm = 0 - 0 = 0 (allowed).\n            *   If m'=+1, Δm = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed).\n        *   Thus, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0⟩.\n\n    The decay path is necessarily of the form |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, where m' can be -1, 0, or +1. All the routes listed in the options A, B, C, D follow this pattern.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of each path:** The probability of a specific decay path is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state is short-lived and decays to the final state with 100% probability (which is a valid assumption here, as 2p → 1s is the only significant decay channel for the 2p state).\n\n    The branching ratio for the transition to a specific state |2,1,m'⟩ is the ratio of the partial decay rate to that state to the total decay rate from |3,0,0⟩.\n\n    The total rate of spontaneous emission from an initial state |i⟩ to a final state |f⟩, integrated over all photon emission directions and summed over polarizations, is proportional to the square of the electric dipole matrix element:\n    Γ(i → f) ∝ |⟨f| **r** |i⟩|^2 = |⟨f|x|i⟩|^2 + |⟨f|y|i⟩|^2 + |⟨f|z|i⟩|^2\n\n    Let's calculate the rates for the first transition: |i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ and |f⟩ = |2,1,m'⟩. The matrix elements can be separated into a radial part and an angular part. The radial integral, R = ∫₀^∞ R₂₁(r) * r * R₃₀(r) r² dr, is the same for all three possible final states (m'=-1,0,1). The relative rates are determined by the angular parts.\n\n    The wavefunctions' angular parts are the spherical harmonics Yₗᵐ(θ,φ), and the position operators' angular parts are also related to Y₁ᵐ:\n    z ∝ Y₁⁰\n    x ± iy ∝ Y₁^±¹\n\n    The calculation involves integrals of three spherical harmonics, like ∫ Yₗ₁ᵐ¹* Yₗ₂ᵐ² Yₗ₃ᵐ³ dΩ. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or direct calculation of these integrals gives the following results for the squares of the matrix elements:\n\n    *   **For the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩ (m'=0):**\n        This is a Δm=0 transition, so only the z-operator contributes.\n        Γ(→|2,1,0⟩) ∝ |⟨2,1,0|z|3,0,0⟩|² ∝ |R|² * (1/3)\n\n    *   **For the intermediate states |2,1,±1⟩ (m'=±1):**\n        These are Δm=±1 transitions, so only the x and y operators contribute.\n        Γ(→|2,1,±1⟩) ∝ |⟨2,1,±1|x|3,0,0⟩|² + |⟨2,1,±1|y|3,0,0⟩|² ∝ |R|² * (1/6 + 1/6) = |R|² * (1/3)\n\n    The calculation shows that the transition rates to all three intermediate substates are equal:\n    Γ(→|2,1,-1⟩) = Γ(→|2,1,0⟩) = Γ(→|2,1,1⟩)\n\n5.  **Determine the Branching Ratios:**\n    The total decay rate from |3,0,0⟩ is the sum of the rates to the three possible intermediate states:\n    Γ_total = Γ(→|2,1,-1⟩) + Γ(→|2,1,0⟩) + Γ(→|2,1,1⟩)\n    Let Γ_single = |R|² * C * (1/3) be the rate for one channel. Then Γ_total = 3 * Γ_single.\n\n    The branching ratio (probability) for the decay to proceed through a specific channel, say m', is:\n    P(m') = Γ(→|2,1,m'⟩) / Γ_total = Γ_single / (3 * Γ_single) = 1/3\n\n    So, the probability for each of the three possible decay paths is 1/3.\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    We check the given options:\n    A) ... and 1/4\n    B) ... and 2/3\n    C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3\n    D) ... and 1/4\n\n    Our calculated probability for the route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ is 1/3, which matches option C.\n\nFinal Answer formulation using LaTeX.\nThe initial state is |3,0,0\\rangle and the final state is |1,0,0\\rangle. The decay happens via two dipole transitions, so there is one intermediate state.\nThe selection rules are \\Delta l = \\pm 1 and \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1.\nFirst transition: from |3,0,0\\rangle (l=0, m=0). The intermediate state |n',l',m'\\rangle must have l'=1 and m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}. The most probable n' is 2. So the intermediate states are |2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle.\nSecond transition: from |2,1,m'\\rangle to |1,0,0\\rangle. Here l'=1 \\rightarrow l_f=0, which respects \\Delta l=-1. m' \\rightarrow m_f=0 which respects \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1 for all possible m'.\nThe probability of a specific decay path is the branching ratio of the first transition. The transition rate from |n,l,m\\rangle to |n',l',m'\\rangle is given by \\Gamma \\propto |\\langle n'l'm'|\\mathbf{r}|nlm\\rangle|^2.\nFor the initial state |3,0,0\\rangle, the transition rates to the three degenerate states |2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle and |2,1,1\\rangle are found to be equal.\n\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\propto C for m'=-1,0,1.\nThe total transition rate is \\Gamma_{total} = \\sum_{m'=-1}^{1} \\Gamma_C = 3C.\nThe branching ratio for any specific channel m' is P(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma_C}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{C}{3C} = \\frac{1}{3}.\nTherefore, the route |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle has a probability of \\frac{1}{3}.\n\n<<<C>>>"
