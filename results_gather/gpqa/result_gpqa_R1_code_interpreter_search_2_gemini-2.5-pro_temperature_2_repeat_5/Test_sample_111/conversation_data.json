    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Normalize the Initial State `|alpha>`\n\nThe state is given as `|ψ> ∝ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. We need to find the normalization constant, `C`, such that `|alpha> = C |ψ>`.\nThe norm squared of the state is:\n`<ψ|ψ> = ((1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|) * ((1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>)`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1² + 1²) + (2² + 1²) = (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization condition is `<alpha|alpha> = 1`, which means `|C|² <ψ|ψ> = 1`.\n`|C|² * 7 = 1  => |C|² = 1/7`\nWe can choose `C = 1/√7`.\n\nSo, the normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]`\nIn the standard basis where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state vector is:\n`|alpha> = (1/√7) * [ 1+i, 2-i ]ᵀ`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A\n\nThe problem states that the matrix elements `Aij` are `ħ/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `0` otherwise. In a 2x2 matrix representation corresponding to the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this is:\n`A = [[A₁₁, A₁₂], [A₂₁, A₂₂]]`\n`A₁₁ = 0`, `A₂₂ = 0`\n`A₁₂ = ħ/2`, `A₂₁ = ħ/2`\nSo, the operator matrix is:\n`A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(ħ/2)σₓ`, where `σₓ` is the Pauli X matrix.\n\n### 3. Find Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of A\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`λ`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = 0`\n`λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\n`λ² = (ħ/2)²`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   **For λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    `(A - λ₁I) |v₁> = 0`\n    `(ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] [x, y]ᵀ = (ħ/2) [x, y]ᵀ`\n    `[y, x]ᵀ = [x, y]ᵀ  =>  x = y`\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]ᵀ`. Normalizing it gives:\n    `|v₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    `(A - λ₂I) |v₂> = 0`\n    `(ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] [x, y]ᵀ = -(ħ/2) [x, y]ᵀ`\n    `[y, x]ᵀ = [-x, -y]ᵀ  =>  y = -x`\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]ᵀ`. Normalizing it gives:\n    `|v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability `P(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state `|alpha>` onto the corresponding eigenvector `|v>`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    `P₁ = |<v₁|alpha>|²`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * [ (1)*(1+i) + (1)*(2-i) ]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14`\n    `P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    `P₂ = |<v₂|alpha>|²`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * [ (1)*(1+i) - (1)*(2-i) ]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the two eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 5. Find the Average Value of the Operator A\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated using `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`.\n\nFirst, calculate `A|alpha>`:\n`A|alpha> = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ`\n`A|alpha> = (ħ / (2√7)) * [2-i, 1+i]ᵀ`\n\nNow, compute `<alpha|A|alpha>`:\n`<alpha| = (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i]`\n`<A> = [(1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i]] * [(ħ / (2√7)) * [2-i, 1+i]ᵀ]`\n`<A> = (ħ / (7*2)) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - 2i - i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²) ]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [ 2 ]`\n`<A> = ħ/7`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `ħ/7`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
