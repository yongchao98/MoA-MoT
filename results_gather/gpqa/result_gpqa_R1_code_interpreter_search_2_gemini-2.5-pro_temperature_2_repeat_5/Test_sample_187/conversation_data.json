    "The user wants to find the interplanar distance for a specific plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Parameters:**\n    *   The crystal system is rhombohedral.\n    *   The lattice parameter is `a = 10` Angstrom. For a rhombohedral cell, the primitive lattice vectors have equal length, so `a = b = c = 10 Å`.\n    *   The interaxial angles are `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n    *   The Miller indices of the plane are `(h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1)`.\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Formula:**\n    The formula for the interplanar spacing, `d_hkl`, in a general triclinic system is given by a complex expression involving all lattice parameters (`a`, `b`, `c`, `α`, `β`, `γ`). For a rhombohedral system, this formula simplifies because `a = b = c` and `α = β = γ`.
