    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** The problem involves uncertainties in position and energy, which points directly to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Additionally, the electron's speed (2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), so relativistic effects must be considered.\n\n2.  **Apply Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The principle relates the minimum uncertainty in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) as:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp = ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    We can solve for the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n    Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n3.  **Relate Energy Uncertainty (ΔE) to Momentum Uncertainty (Δp):** For a relativistic particle, the relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p) is given by:\n    E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    To find how a small change in momentum (Δp) affects the energy (ΔE), we can differentiate this equation. This gives us the relationship:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n    where v is the velocity of the particle. This approximation is valid because the change in momentum is small.\n\n4.  **Combine the equations:** Now we can substitute the expression for Δp from the uncertainty principle into our energy-momentum relation:\n    ΔE = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n5.  **Calculate the value:** We are given:\n    *   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n    Plugging these values into the combined equation:\n    ΔE = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ [ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m) ]\n    ΔE = (2 x 10⁸) ⋅ [ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴) / (0.2 x 10⁻⁹) ]\n    ΔE = (2 x 10⁸) ⋅ (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵)\n    ΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:** The calculated value, ~1.05 x 10⁻¹⁶ J, is very close to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nThe executed Python code confirms this calculation, providing a result of `1.055e-16`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
