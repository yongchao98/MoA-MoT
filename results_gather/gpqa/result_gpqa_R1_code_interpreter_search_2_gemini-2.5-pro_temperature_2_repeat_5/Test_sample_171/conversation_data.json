    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atoms in different energy levels within stars assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This situation is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (j) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (i):\n    `(N_j / N_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in states j and i.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the states (`E_j - E_i`).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to each star:** We can write the Boltzmann equation for both star_1 (with temperature `T_1`) and star_2 (with temperature `T_2`). Let's denote the ratio `N_j / N_i` as `R`.\n\n    For star_1:\n    `R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\n    For star_2:\n    `R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    The term `(g_j / g_i)` and `ΔE` are properties of the specific iron transition and are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Incorporate the condition from the problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited ... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of populations `R_1` is twice the ratio `R_2`:\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n5.  **Substitute and simplify:** Now, substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this condition:\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    The statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` is common on both sides and can be canceled out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures from the exponents, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation.\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n7.  **Rearrange the equation:** Our goal is to find an expression that matches one of the options. Let's isolate `ln(2)`:\n    `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T_2) - (1 / T_1) ]`\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the brackets:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n8.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant is a fundamental physical constant with the value `k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    The problem is intentionally designed so that the numerical value of `ΔE` is virtually identical to the Boltzmann constant `k`. Therefore, their ratio is approximately 1:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\n9.  **Finalize the equation:** Substituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1` into our equation gives the final result:\n    `ln(2) = (1) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n10. **Compare with the options:** This final equation perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
