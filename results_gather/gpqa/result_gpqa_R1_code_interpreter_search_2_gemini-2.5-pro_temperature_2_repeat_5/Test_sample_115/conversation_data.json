    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A:**\n    *   The proton NMR spectrum of compound A shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H.\n    *   A 6H signal indicates six equivalent protons. A triplet means they are adjacent to a carbon with two protons (-CH2-). This suggests two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   A 4H signal indicates four equivalent protons. A quartet means they are adjacent to a carbon with three protons (-CH3). This suggests two equivalent methylene groups (-CH2-).\n    *   Combining these facts (two equivalent -CH3 next to a -CH2- and two equivalent -CH2- next to a -CH3) describes two ethyl groups (-CH2-CH3) in a symmetrical environment. The only way to join two ethyl groups to form a hydrocarbon is to make n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3).\n    *   Let's check the NMR for n-butane. Due to symmetry, the two -CH3 groups are equivalent, and the two -CH2- groups are equivalent. The terminal -CH3 protons (6H) are coupled to the adjacent -CH2- (2H), so they appear as a triplet. The internal -CH2- protons (4H) are coupled to an adjacent -CH3 (3H), so they would appear as a quartet. * (Note: In reality, they are also coupled to the other -CH2- group, which would result in a more complex multiplet, but for introductory problems, it is often simplified to a quartet based on the adjacent methyl group).\n    *   Thus, **Compound A is n-butane**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound B:**\n    *   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a radical halogenation reaction. There are two possible positions for bromination: C1 (primary) and C2 (secondary).\n    *   Bromination at the secondary carbon (C2) is faster because the secondary radical intermediate is more stable than the primary radical.\n    *   Therefore, the major product of monobromination of n-butane is 2-bromobutane.\n    *   **Compound B is 2-bromobutane** (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3).\n\n3.  **Identify Compound C:**\n    *   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a strong, non-bulky base in a polar aprotic solvent, favoring an E2 (elimination) reaction.\n    *   Dehydrohalogenation of 2-bromobutane can yield two products: but-1-ene (from removing a proton from C1) and but-2-ene (from removing a proton from C3).\n    *   According to Zaitsev's rule, elimination favors the formation of the more substituted (more stable) alkene. But-2-ene is more substituted than but-1-ene.\n    *   The problem states that compound C has two geometrical isomers. But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers (*cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene), whereas but-1-ene does not.\n    *   This confirms that **Compound C is but-2-ene** (CH3-CH=CH-CH3).\n\n4.  **Identify Compound D:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n        *   **Dienophile:** The *cis*-isomer of C, which is *cis*-but-2-ene.\n        *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n    *   The reaction forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative). The base structure is 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder reaction:**\n        1.  **Dienophile Stereochemistry:** The reaction is stereospecific with respect to the dienophile. Since we start with *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (on what will become C5 and C6 of the product ring) must be *cis* to each other in the product.\n        2.  **Diene Stereochemistry:** The reaction is also stereospecific with respect to the diene. A diene with (E,E) configuration, such as our (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, results in the substituents at the ends of the diene (the -OH on C1 and the -CH3 on C4) being *trans* to each other in the product.\n        3.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity:** The Diels-Alder reaction typically proceeds via an *endo* transition state, which is kinetically favored. According to the endo rule, the substituents on the dienophile (the two methyl groups) align under the diene π-system in the transition state. This results in the dienophile's methyl groups being *trans* to the \"outer\" groups of the diene (in this case, the C4-methyl group) and *cis* to the \"inner\" groups (the C1-hydroxyl group).\n    *   **Combining the stereochemical rules for the *endo* product:**\n        *   The C5-Me and C6-Me groups are *cis* to each other.\n        *   The C1-OH and C4-Me groups are *trans* to each other.\n        *   The {C5-Me, C6-Me} pair is *cis* to the C1-OH group.\n        *   From the above, it follows that the {C5-Me, C6-Me} pair must be *trans* to the C4-Me group.\n    *   Let's define a specific stereoisomer based on these relationships:\n        *   Let the C5-Me and C6-Me groups point \"down\" (dashed wedge).\n        *   This means the C1-OH group also points \"down\" (dashed wedge).\n        *   This means the C4-Me group must point \"up\" (solid wedge).\n    *   **Assigning R/S Configuration:** Now we determine the absolute configuration (R/S) for this specific molecule.\n        *   **C1:** Priorities: -OH > C2=C > C6 > -H. The C1-OH is \"down\" (dash), so the C1-H is \"up\" (wedge). The path 1→2→3 is clockwise (R), but since the lowest priority group (H) is pointing towards us, we reverse the assignment to **S**. So, we have **1S**.\n        *   **C4:** Priorities: C3=C > C5 > -CH3 > -H. The C4-Me is \"up\" (wedge), so the C4-H is \"down\" (dash). The path 1→2→3 is clockwise (R). The lowest priority group (H) is pointing away, so we keep the assignment as **R**. So, we have **4R**.\n        *   **C5:** Priorities: C4 > C6 > -CH3 > -H. The C5-Me is \"down\" (dash), so the C5-H is \"up\" (wedge). The path 1→2→3 is clockwise (R). The lowest priority group (H) points towards us, so we reverse to **S**. So, we have **5S**.\n        *   **C6:** Priorities: C1 > C5 > -CH3 > -H. The C6-Me is \"down\" (dash), so the C6-H is \"up\" (wedge). The path 1→2→3 is clockwise (R). The lowest priority group (H) points towards us, so we reverse to **S**. So, we have **6S**.\n    *   The final product D is the enantiomer with the configuration **(1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
