    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Goal\n\nThe problem asks for two things based on the given interaction Lagrangian `L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}`:\n1.  The mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ`.\n2.  Whether the theory described by this interaction is renormalizable.\n\nWe will use dimensional analysis in natural units, where the action `S` is dimensionless, and `ħ = c = 1`.\n\n### 2. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density\n\nThe action `S` is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over 4-dimensional spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d⁴x L`\n\nFor the action `S` to be dimensionless (`[S] = 0`), the mass dimension of `L` must compensate for the dimension of the spacetime volume element `d⁴x`.\nThe dimension of spacetime coordinates `x` is `[x] = -1` in mass units (since `[momentum] * [length] = [ħ] = 0`, so `[p] = -[x]`, and `[p]=[mass]=1`).\nTherefore, the dimension of the spacetime volume element is `[d⁴x] = [x]⁴ = -4`.\nThis implies that the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density `L` must be `[L] = 4`.\nSince `L_int` is a term in the full Lagrangian, it must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n`[L_int] = 4`.\n\n### 3. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Operators\n\nNow, let's determine the mass dimension of each component in the interaction term `L_int`.\n\n*   **Fermion Field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is `L_kinetic_fermion = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ`. This term must have a mass dimension of 4.\n    *   The gamma matrices `γ^μ` are dimensionless: `[γ^μ] = 0`.\n    *   The derivative `∂_μ` has a mass dimension of 1: `[∂_μ] = 1`.\n    *   The dimensions of `ψ` and `ψ̄` are the same: `[ψ] = [ψ̄]`.\n    So, for the kinetic term: `[ψ̄] + [γ^μ] + [∂_μ] + [ψ] = 4`.\n    `[ψ] + 0 + 1 + [ψ] = 4`\n    `2[ψ] = 3`\n    `[ψ] = 3/2`.\n\n*   **σ_{μν}:** This operator is defined as `σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. Since the gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n    `[σ_{μν}] = 0`.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor (F^{μν}):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_kinetic_photon = -(1/4) F_{μν} F^{μν}`. This term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n    *   The dimensions of the covariant and contravariant forms are the same: `[F_{μν}] = [F^{μν}]`.\n    So, for the kinetic term: `[F_{μν}] + [F^{μν}] = 4`.\n    `2[F^{μν}] = 4`\n    `[F^{μν}] = 2`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Mass Dimension of κ\n\nNow we can find the mass dimension of `κ` by ensuring that the total dimension of `L_int` is 4.\n`[L_int] = [κ] [ψ̄] [σ_{μν}] [ψ] [F^{μν}] = 4`\nPlugging in the dimensions we found:\n`[κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 5 = 4`\n`[κ] = -1`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` is -1.\n\n### 5. Determining Renormalizability\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be assessed (by a rule of thumb known as power-counting) from the mass dimension of its coupling constants. Let `g` be a coupling constant.\n\n*   If `[g] > 0`, the interaction is \"super-renormalizable\".\n*   If `[g] = 0`, the interaction is \"renormalizable\".\n*   If `[g] < 0`, the interaction is \"non-renormalizable\".\n\nIn this theory, the coupling constant `κ` has a mass dimension `[κ] = -1`. Since this is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable. In such theories, loop calculations typically lead to divergences that become worse at higher orders of perturbation theory, requiring an infinite number of counter-terms to cancel them, which destroys the predictive power of the theory.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The mass dimension of `κ` is `[κ]_M = -1`.\n*   The theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
