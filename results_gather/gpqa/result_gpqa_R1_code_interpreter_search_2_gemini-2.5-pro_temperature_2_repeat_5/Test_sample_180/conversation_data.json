    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial and final states of the Sun's neutrino production.**\n    *   The Sun produces neutrinos through several reactions, primarily the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle.\n    *   The pp-chain has three main branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III.\n    *   The question states that the pp-III branch stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing Boron-8 (`⁸B`) neutrinos. Therefore, the flux of `⁸B` neutrinos becomes zero.\n    *   The question specifies that \"all other reactions remained as they were.\" This means the fluxes from the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle reactions are unaffected.\n\n2.  **Identify the relevant neutrino sources for the given energy bands.**\n    *   The two energy bands are Band 1 (700-800 keV or 0.7-0.8 MeV) and Band 2 (800-900 keV or 0.8-0.9 MeV).\n    *   Let's check which neutrino sources contribute to these bands after the `⁸B` flux disappears:\n        *   **pp neutrinos:** Maximum energy is ~420 keV. They do **not** contribute to either band.\n        *   **pep neutrinos:** Monoenergetic at 1.44 MeV. They do **not** contribute to either band.\n        *   **⁸B neutrinos:** Flux is now zero, so they contribute nothing. (Before the change, they contributed a continuous spectrum of flux to both bands).\n        *   **⁷Be neutrinos (from the pp-II branch):** This reaction is unaffected. It produces monoenergetic neutrinos, most prominently a very strong line at 861 keV (0.861 MeV). This line falls squarely inside **Band 2**. Its contribution to Band 1 is zero.\n        *   **CNO cycle neutrinos (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O`):** These reactions are unaffected. They produce continuous spectra of neutrinos that extend above 1 MeV. Therefore, they contribute to the flux in **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the flux in each band after the change.**\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Since the `⁸B` neutrinos are gone and the `⁷Be` line is outside this band, the only remaining contribution is from the continuous spectrum of CNO neutrinos.\n        *   Flux(band 1) = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The flux in this band has two components: the contribution from the continuous CNO spectrum and the contribution from the monoenergetic `⁷Be` line.\n        *   Flux(band 2) = Flux_CNO(800-900 keV) + Flux_line(⁷Be @ 861 keV)\n\n4.  **Evaluate the ratio and interpret the question.**\n    *   The literal ratio would be:\n        Ratio = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) / [ Flux_CNO(800-900 keV) + Flux_line(⁷Be) ]\n    *   According to the Standard Solar Model, the flux from the `⁷Be` line (~5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s) is many orders of magnitude larger than the integrated flux from the CNO continuum over a 100 keV band (which is on the order of ~10³-10⁴ neutrinos/cm²/s).\n    *   Therefore, the denominator is completely dominated by the `⁷Be` line flux. The resulting ratio would be a very small number (e.g., 10⁴ / 10⁹ = 10⁻⁵), which does not match any of the provided options (10, 0.1, 0.01, 1).\n    *   This discrepancy suggests that the question is not asking for the ratio of the *total* flux. In physics, when a spectrum contains both a continuous background and a sharp line, a question about \"flux\" can sometimes refer to the underlying continuous background flux. This is the only interpretation that allows for one of the multiple-choice answers to be correct.\n    *   Let's assume the question is asking for the ratio of the **continuous flux** in the two bands.\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio of the continuous fluxes.**\n    *   Under this interpretation, we ignore the `⁷Be` line's contribution to Band 2.\n    *   The ratio becomes:\n        Ratio ≈ Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) / Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)\n    *   The CNO neutrino spectrum is a smooth function of energy and does not vary rapidly over this narrow energy range (700-900 keV).\n    *   Because the two bands are adjacent and have the same width (100 keV), the integrated CNO flux over Band 1 will be approximately equal to the integrated CNO flux over Band 2.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of their fluxes is approximately 1.\n\n    Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) ≈ Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)\n    Ratio ≈ 1\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
