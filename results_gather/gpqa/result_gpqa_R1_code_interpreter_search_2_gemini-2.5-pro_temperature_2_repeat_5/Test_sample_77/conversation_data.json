    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials, V and $\\vec{A}$, generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Start with the general retarded potentials:** The solutions for the scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ in terms of the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. The potentials at point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ depend on the state of the sources at an earlier time $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Model the moving point charge:** For a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be represented using the Dirac delta function:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$.\n\n3.  **Substitute the densities into the potential integrals:**\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    Here, $t_r$ is a function of the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. This makes the integral non-trivial. The standard evaluation of this integral (often detailed in advanced E&M textbooks) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potential.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the scalar potential V:** The integral requires careful treatment of the delta function whose argument depends on the integration variable. The result of the integration is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R (1 - \\hat{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    The square brackets indicate that all quantities inside must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    Let's match the terms with the notation given in the question:\n    *   The source position at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the source at the retarded time to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. This corresponds to $\\vec{R}$ in the standard formula.\n    *   The distance is $d = |\\vec{d}|$, corresponding to $R$. The unit vector is $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\n    Substituting this notation into the formula:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 d (1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the vector potential A:** The vector potential can be found in a similar way. For a point charge, the current density is just the charge density times the velocity: $\\vec{J} = \\rho \\vec{v}$.\n    This leads to a simple relationship between the potentials:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(t_r)}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n    Here, $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n    Substituting the expression for V we just found:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    To match the form in the options, we use the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, which implies $1/(\\epsilon_0 c) = \\mu_0 c$.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 c q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These results match option A exactly.\n\n    *   Option B and D use the static Coulomb potential form, which is incorrect.\n    *   Option C has a plus sign in the denominator, which is incorrect. The minus sign arises from the Doppler-like effect on the apparent volume of the source; when the source moves towards the observer, the potentials are strengthened, and when it moves away, they are weakened. The term $-\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}$ correctly captures this.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
