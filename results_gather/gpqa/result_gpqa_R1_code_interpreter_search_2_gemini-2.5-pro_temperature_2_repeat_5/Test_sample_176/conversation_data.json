    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, `L_1 / L_2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** For a star radiating as a perfect black body, its luminosity (`L`) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    `L = A * σ * T^4 = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4`\n    where:\n    *   `R` is the star's radius.\n    *   `T` is the star's surface temperature.\n    *   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `A = 4 * π * R^2` is the surface area of the star.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the luminosity for each star and then divide them:\n    `L_1 = 4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4`\n    `L_2 = 4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4`\n\n    The ratio is:\n    `L_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4) / (4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4)`\n    Simplifying by canceling the constants (`4`, `π`, `σ`), we get:\n    `L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n\n4.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that `R_1 = 1.5 * R_2`, which means the ratio `R_1 / R_2 = 1.5`.\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    `L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T_1 / T_2):**\n    *   The temperature of a black body is related to the peak wavelength (`λ_max`) of its emitted radiation by Wien's Displacement Law: `λ_max * T = b`, where `b` is a constant. This can be rewritten as `T = b / λ_max`.\n    *   This law applies to the wavelength *emitted* by the star in its own rest frame (`λ_emit`). So, `T ∝ 1 / λ_emit`.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is `T_1 / T_2 = λ_emit_2 / λ_emit_1`.\n    *   The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest ... are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (`λ_obs`), which is what an astronomer on Earth would measure. So, `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`.\n    *   The observed wavelength can be different from the emitted wavelength due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's radial velocity (`v_r`).\n    *   For Star 1, `v_r1 = 0`. There is no Doppler shift, so the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength: `λ_obs_1 = λ_emit_1`.\n    *   For Star 2, `v_r2 = 700 km/s`. This velocity is non-zero, causing a Doppler shift. Radial velocity is conventionally positive for receding objects (moving away), which causes a redshift. The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is `λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   So, for Star 2: `λ_obs_2 = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we can set the expressions for them equal: `λ_emit_1 = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for our temperature ratio: `λ_emit_2 / λ_emit_1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is `T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n\n6.  **Complete the Calculation for the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    `L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)]^4`\n    `L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_r2 / c)^4`\n\n7.  **Plug in the numerical values:**\n    *   `v_r2 = 700 km/s`\n    *   `c ≈ 299792.458 km/s` (speed of light)\n    The ratio is calculated as follows:\n```python\nv_r2 = 700.0  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nc = 299792.458  # Speed of light in km/s\nradius_ratio_sq = 1.5**2 # (R_1/R_2)^2\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio L_1/L_2\nluminosity_ratio = radius_ratio_sq / (1 + v_r2 / c)**4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n> executing code...\n> 2.22896582496739\n>\n> ---\n\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this value with the given options:\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.35\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe result `2.229` is closest to `2.23`. The other provided information, such as the mass ratio, is not needed for this calculation and can be considered extraneous data.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks us to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star 1 and Star 2 (`L_1 / L_2`).\n\n### 1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law for Luminosity\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n`L = A * σ * T^4`\nwhere:\n*   `A` is the surface area of the star (`A = 4 * π * R^2`, with `R` being the radius).\n*   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the surface temperature of the star.\n\n### 2. Formulating the Luminosity Ratio\nWe can write the luminosity for each star:\n`L_1 = 4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4`\n`L_2 = 4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4`\n\nTo find the ratio `L_1 / L_2`, we divide the first equation by the second:\n`L_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4) / (4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4)`\n\nThe constants (`4`, `π`, `σ`) cancel out, leaving:\n`L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n\n### 3. Using the Given Information\n**Radius Ratio:**\nThe problem states that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star 2 (`R_1 = 1.5 * R_2`).\nTherefore, the ratio of the radii is `R_1 / R_2 = 1.5`.\nSquaring this ratio gives `(R_1 / R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25`.\n\n**Temperature Ratio:**\nThe temperature is related to the peak wavelength (`λ_max`) of the star's emission through Wien's Displacement Law:\n`λ_max * T = b` (where `b` is Wien's constant)\nThis implies that `T` is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength *emitted* by the star in its own rest frame (`λ_emit`):\n`T ∝ 1 / λ_emit`\nSo, the ratio of temperatures is: `T_1 / T_2 = λ_emit_2 / λ_emit_1`.\n\nWe are told that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (`λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`). The observed wavelength can be different from the emitted wavelength due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's radial velocity (`v_r`).\n\n*   For Star 1, `v_r1 = 0`. There is no Doppler shift, so `λ_obs_1 = λ_emit_1`.\n*   For Star 2, `v_r2 = 700 km/s`. This non-zero velocity causes a Doppler shift. The formula for the Doppler shift is `λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    Therefore, `λ_obs_2 = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n\nSince `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we can set their expressions equal:\n`λ_emit_1 = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `λ_emit_2 / λ_emit_1`:\n`λ_emit_2 / λ_emit_1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n\nThis gives us the temperature ratio:\n`T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius ratio and temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v_r2 / c))^4`\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_r2 / c)^4`\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n*   `v_r2 = 700 km/s`\n*   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s` (speed of light)\n\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300000)^4`\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333...)^4`\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1.002333...)^4`\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / 1.00937`\n`L_1 / L_2 ≈ 2.2291`\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\nNote: The information about the mass ratio (`M_1 / M_2 = 1.5`) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.35\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>"
