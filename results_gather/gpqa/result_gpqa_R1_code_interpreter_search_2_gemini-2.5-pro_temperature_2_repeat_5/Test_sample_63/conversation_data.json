    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental results to determine the composition of the gaseous mixture.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube corresponds to the mass of water produced from the decomposition.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂, which would react to form a precipitate (CaCO₃ or CaSO₃). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no such acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that can react with oxygen-containing gases. The problem states that CuO was formed, and the mass of the tube increased. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass increase = Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygenated gas. Common decomposition products of nitrogen salts include N₂O or NO.\n        *   If the gas was N₂O, the reaction is: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂. For every mole of CuO formed, 1 mole of N₂O reacts, supplying 1 mole of O atoms. Thus, 0.05 moles of N₂O must have reacted.\n        *   If the gas was NO, the reaction is: 2NO + 2Cu → 2CuO + N₂. For every mole of CuO formed, 1 mole of NO reacts, supplying 1 mole of O atoms. Thus, 0.05 moles of NO must have reacted.\n    *   Let's see where this leads. The reaction in Tube 3 also produces nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C is what is left after passing through H₂O absorption, acidic gas absorption, and reaction with hot Cu. It must be a non-acidic, relatively inert gas. Nitrogen (N₂) is the most likely candidate.\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct the initial gas mixture and determine the elemental composition.**\n\nLet's assume the oxygen source was nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂ shows that the 0.05 mol of O atoms came from 0.05 mol of N₂O, and this reaction produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\nThe final gas C (0.10 mol of N₂) is composed of:\n*   N₂ produced in Tube 3 from N₂O: 0.05 mol\n*   N₂ that was initially present in the gas mixture and did not react: Total N₂ - Produced N₂ = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the gas mixture formed by heating salts A and B was:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O (which reacted in Tube 3)\n*   0.05 mol N₂ (which passed through unreacted until the end)\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in this gas mixture. Since these gases are the only products, this must be the elemental composition of the original salts.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol H₂O → 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.05 mol N₂O and 0.05 mol N₂ → (0.05 * 2) + (0.05 * 2) = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol H₂O and 0.05 mol N₂O → (0.20 * 1) + (0.05 * 1) = 0.25 mol O.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture, meaning `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B were heated.\nThe total mass of the mixture is 7.20 g.\n\nFrom our elemental analysis, the entire mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The ratio of moles n(A and B) to moles of elements is:\n*   `2n` / n(N) = `2n` / 0.20\n*   `2n` / n(H) = `2n` / 0.40\n*   `2n` / n(O) = `2n` / 0.25\n\nThe mole ratio N:H:O in the combined salts is 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25, which simplifies to 20:40:25 or 4:8:5.\nSo, the combined empirical formula of (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nLet's check the mass of this combined unit:\nM(N₄H₈O₅) = 4*14.01 + 8*1.008 + 5*16.00 = 56.04 + 8.064 + 80.00 ≈ 144.1 g/mol.\n\nNow let's find the value of `n` (moles of each salt).\nTotal mass = n * M(A) + n * M(B) = n * (M(A) + M(B)) = 7.20 g.\nThe combined molar mass (M(A) + M(B)) is the molar mass of our N₄H₈O₅ unit, which is 144.1 g/mol.\nn * (144.1 g/mol) = 7.20 g → n = 7.20 / 144.1 ≈ 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, we started with 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B. Let's see if this is consistent with our product calculations:\n*   Predicted N₂ production: `n` = 0.05 mol. Matches.\n*   Predicted N₂O production: `n` = 0.05 mol. Matches.\n*   Predicted H₂O production: should be 0.20 mol total.\n\nWe need to split the formula N₄H₈O₅ into two salts, A and B, that would decompose at 200°C without solid residue. Ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen are prime candidates.\nLet's try to make two ammonium salts. The NH₄⁺ ion accounts for N and H. Two NH₄⁺ ions would use N₂H₈.\nWhat's left from N₄H₈O₅ is N₂O₅. We need to split N₂O₅ into two stable oxoanions. The most common are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Together, they are N₂O₅.\nThis suggests the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis.\n*   **Combined Formula:** (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. Correct.\n*   **Molar Masses:** M(NH₄NO₃) = 80.04 g/mol. M(NH₄NO₂) = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Sum of molar masses = 80.04 + 64.04 = 144.08 g/mol. Correct.\n    *   Total mass of mixture = 0.05 mol * (80.04 + 64.04) g/mol = 0.05 * 144.08 = 7.204 g. Correct.\n*   **Decomposition Reactions:**\n    *   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Products from 0.05 mol of each salt:**\n    *   From A: 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   From B: 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   Total products: 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂, 0.20 mol H₂O.\nThis perfectly matches the gas mixture we deduced from the experimental data.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nH = 1.008\nN = 14.007\nO = 15.999\n\n# Experimental data\nmass_total = 7.20  # g\nmass_increase_tube1 = 3.60  # g, this is mass of H2O\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80   # g, this is mass of O\nvolume_gas_C = 2.24  # L at STP\n\n# Molar mass of H2O and O\nM_H2O = 2*H + O\nM_O = O\n\n# Moles of products\nmoles_H2O = mass_increase_tube1 / M_H2O\nmoles_O_from_gas = mass_increase_tube3 / M_O\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C / 22.4  # moles\n\n# The reaction in tube 3 is assumed to be Cu + N2O -> CuO + N2\n# Thus, moles_N2O = moles_O_from_gas\n# And moles_N2_produced = moles_N2O\nmoles_N2O = moles_O_from_gas\nmoles_N2_produced = moles_N2O\n\n# The final gas C is N2. Its total moles are the sum of initial N2 and produced N2.\n# moles_gas_C = moles_N2_initial + moles_N2_produced\nmoles_N2_initial = moles_gas_C - moles_N2_produced\n\n# So, the initial gas mixture was:\n# moles_H2O, moles_N2O, moles_N2_initial\n\n# Total moles of each element in the original salt mixture\ntotal_moles_H = moles_H2O * 2\ntotal_moles_N = moles_N2O * 2 + moles_N2_initial * 2\ntotal_moles_O = moles_H2O * 1 + moles_N2O * 1\n\n# Let n be the moles of each salt (A and B) in the equimolar mixture.\n# The total amount of the N4H8O5 unit is n.\n# So, total_moles_N = n * 4\n# total_moles_H = n * 8\n# total_moles_O = n * 5\n# We can find n from any of these.

    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** The goal is to identify salts A and B by first identifying their decomposition products. The gaseous mixture passes through three tubes.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol H₂O.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This suggests the salts do not contain carbonate or sulfite/sulfate anions that decompose to acidic gases.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the mass increases by 0.80 g. This mass increase is solely due to the oxygen that binds to the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of oxygen (O) is 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol O.\n        *   The gas that donated this oxygen must be a nitrogen oxide, as no other elements are suggested. Common neutral nitrogen oxides are N₂O (nitrous oxide) and NO (nitric oxide). The reaction in the tube also produces N₂.\n            *   Case 1: `N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂`. One mole of N₂O provides one mole of O.\n            *   Case 2: `2NO + 2Cu → 2CuO + N₂`. One mole of NO provides one mole of O.\n        *   In both plausible cases, 0.05 moles of O atoms came from 0.05 moles of the nitrogen oxide gas (let's call it Gas X). This reaction also produces N₂. The amount of N₂ produced is 0.05 moles in the N₂O case and 0.025 moles in the NO case. Let's tentatively assume the gas is N₂O, as it's a very common product of ammonium salt decomposition. If this assumption works out, we'll stick with it.\n        *   So, we assume the gas mixture contained **0.05 mol of N₂O**, which reacted completely in tube №3, producing **0.05 mol of N₂**.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains. At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   Gas C is what's left over. It must be very unreactive. Nitrogen (N₂) fits this description perfectly.\n        *   This 0.10 mol of N₂ is the total N₂ at the end. It includes the N₂ produced in Tube №3 (from the decomposition of N₂O) and any N₂ that was part of the original gas mixture.\n        *   Total N₂ = (N₂ from original mixture) + (N₂ from N₂O).\n        *   0.10 mol = (N₂ from original mixture) + 0.05 mol.\n        *   Therefore, Moles of N₂ from original mixture = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n\n2.  **Reconstruct the Original Gas Mixture:**\n    Based on the analysis, the thermal decomposition of salts A and B produced a mixture of:\n    *   0.20 mol H₂O\n    *   0.05 mol N₂O\n    *   0.05 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of Salts A and B:**\n    Since only gases were formed, all atoms from the initial 7.20 g of salts are now in this gaseous mixture.\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** from 0.20 mol H₂O = 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** from 0.05 mol N₂O and 0.05 mol N₂ = (0.05 * 2) + (0.05 * 2) = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** from 0.20 mol H₂O and 0.05 mol N₂O = (0.20 * 1) + (0.05 * 1) = 0.25 mol O.\n\n4.  **Identify the Salts:**\n    We know the mixture is \"equimolar,\" meaning there are `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B. The elemental composition we found (0.40 H, 0.20 N, 0.25 O) corresponds to the total `n` moles of A + `n` moles of B.\n    Let's find the ratio of atoms in the combined \"formula unit\" of (A+B):\n    N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n    To get the simplest whole number ratio, we can multiply all by 20:\n    N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n    So, the combined empirical formula for (Salt A + Salt B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n    Now, we must split this into two plausible salt formulas. Since heating produced N₂O, N₂, and H₂O without solid residue, ammonium salts are the most likely candidates.\n    *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrate: `NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O`\n    *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrite: `NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O`\n\n    Let's check if these two salts, A = NH₄NO₃ and B = NH₄NO₂, fit our combined formula:\n    *   Formula of NH₄NO₃: **N₂H₄O₃**\n    *   Formula of NH₄NO₂: **N₂H₄O₂**\n    *   Sum of formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n5.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   If A is NH₄NO₃ and B is NH₄NO₂, an equimolar mixture (`n` moles of each) would produce `n` moles of N₂O, `n` moles of N₂, and `2n + 2n = 4n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   Our results showed 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    *   This implies `n = 0.05` mol. If n=0.05, then total H₂O is `4 * 0.05 = 0.20` mol. This matches perfectly.\n    *   Let's check the initial mass. Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ ≈ 80 g/mol; Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ ≈ 64 g/mol.\n    *   Mass = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol + 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.2 g. This matches the given initial mass.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B).\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
