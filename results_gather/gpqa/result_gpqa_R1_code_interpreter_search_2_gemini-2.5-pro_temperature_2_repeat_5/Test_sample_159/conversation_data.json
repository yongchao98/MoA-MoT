    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Geometry**\n    *   The problem describes an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon.\n    *   A key piece of information is that the number of sides, N, is infinitely large (N → ∞).\n    *   A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides and a constant apothem 'a' geometrically approaches a circle.\n    *   The apothem of the polygon (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) becomes the radius of this resulting circle. Therefore, the aperture can be modeled as a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Phenomenon**\n    *   A monochromatic light wave of wavelength λ passes through this aperture and forms a pattern in the far-field region.\n    *   This is a classic example of Fraunhofer diffraction.\n    *   The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Condition for Minima**\n    *   The intensity distribution I(θ) for Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture of radius 'a' is given by:\n        I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ))) / (k * a * sin(θ)) ]²\n    *   In this formula:\n        *   θ is the angular position from the central axis.\n        *   I₀ is the intensity at the center (θ = 0).\n        *   k is the wave number, k = 2π / λ.\n        *   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   The intensity minima (dark rings) occur where the intensity is zero. This happens when the numerator J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) is equal to zero, provided the denominator is not zero. The central maximum occurs when the argument is zero, so we look for the non-zero roots of J₁(x).\n    *   Let u = k * a * sin(θ). The minima are found at the angles θₘ such that:\n        k * a * sin(θₘ) = uₘ\n        where uₘ are the non-zero roots (zeros) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\n4.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function**\n    *   We need the first two non-zero roots of the J₁(x) function to find the positions of the first two minima. These are well-known mathematical constants.\n        *   First zero, u₁ ≈ 3.8317\n        *   Second zero, u₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the Minima**\n    *   From the condition for minima, k * a * sin(θₘ) = uₘ, we can solve for θₘ.\n    *   Substituting k = 2π / λ:\n        (2π / λ) * a * sin(θₘ) = uₘ\n    *   The problem states that the angles are small, so we can use the small-angle approximation: sin(θ) ≈ θ.\n        (2π / λ) * a * θₘ = uₘ\n    *   Solving for the angular position θₘ:\n        θM = (uₘ * λ) / (2π * a)\n    *   **Position of the first minimum (θ₁):** Using u₁ ≈ 3.8317\n        θ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)\n    *   **Position of the second minimum (θ₂):** Using u₂ ≈ 7.0156\n        θ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance**\n    *   The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n        Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [ (u₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ] - [ (u₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ]\n        Δθ = [ (u₂ - u₁) / (2π) ] * (λ / a)\n    *   Substituting the values of the zeros:\n        Δθ = [ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ] * (λ / a)\n        Δθ = [ 3.1839 / (2π) ] * (λ / a)\n\n    *   Now, we compute the final numerical coefficient.\n```python\nimport math\nu1 = 3.831706\nu2 = 7.015587\ncoefficient = (u2 - u1) / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.5067941093121303\n</execute_output>\n\n7.  **Final Comparison**\n    *   The calculation gives the angular distance as Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ/a).\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) 1.220 λ/a\n        B) 0.500 λ/a\n        C) 0.610 λ/a  (This is the position of the first minimum, θ₁)\n        D) 0.506 λ/a\n    *   Our calculated value of 0.5068 λ/a is best matched by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

    "The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two diffraction minima for a monochromatic light wave passing through an N-sided polygonal aperture, where N is infinitely large.\n\n1.  **Geometric Simplification**: A regular N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle as the number of sides N tends to infinity. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to calculating the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Physical Model**: The phenomenon described is Fraunhofer diffraction. The far-field intensity pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Condition for Minima**: The angular positions of the intensity minima (dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for a minimum is given by:\n    k * a * sin(θ) = u\n    where:\n    *   k is the wave number, k = 2π / λ.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n    *   u is a non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\n4.  **Small Angle Approximation**: The problem states we can use the small-angle approximation, sin(θ) ≈ θ. The condition becomes:\n    (2π / λ) * a * θₙ = uₙ\n    where θₙ is the angular position of the n-th minimum and uₙ is the n-th zero of J₁(x).\n\n5.  **Angular Position of Minima**: Solving for θₙ, we get:\n    θₙ = (uₙ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\n6.  **Zeros of the Bessel Function**: We need the first two non-zero zeros of J₁(x) to find the positions of the first two minima. These are well-tabulated values:\n    *   First zero, u₁ ≈ 3.8317\n    *   Second zero, u₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\n7.  **Calculate Angular Positions**:\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum is:\n        θ₁ = (u₁ / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a). This value matches option (C), but it's the position of the first minimum, not the distance between the first two.\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum is:\n        θ₂ = (u₂ / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a).\n\n8.  **Calculate Angular Distance**: The question asks for the angular distance between these two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁\n    Δθ = [(u₂ / 2π) * (λ / a)] - [(u₁ / 2π) * (λ / a)]\n    Δθ = (u₂ - u₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)\n\n    Let's compute the numerical coefficient (u₂ - u₁) / (2π).\n\n```python\nimport math\n# Zeros of the first-order Bessel function J1(x)\nu1 = 3.831706  # First zero\nu2 = 7.015587  # Second zero\ncoefficient = (u2 - u1) / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.5067941093121303\n</execute_output>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.5068.\n\n9.  **Conclusion**: The angular distance between the first two minima is Δθ ≈ 0.5068 (λ / a).

    "The reasoning remains consistent regardless of the minor variations in the precise output of the calculation, which likely stem from using slightly different high-precision values for the zeros of the Bessel function. The core physical and mathematical principles are unchanged.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Aperture Shape:** As the number of sides N of a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches infinity, the polygon's shape converges to that of a circle with radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Diffraction Phenomenon:** The problem describes Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture. The resulting far-field intensity distribution is known as an Airy pattern.\n\n3.  **Condition for Minima:** The dark rings (intensity minima) in the Airy pattern occur at angles θ that satisfy the equation:\n    k * a * sin(θ) = u\n    where `k` is the wave number (2π/λ), `a` is the aperture radius, and `u` represents the non-zero roots (zeros) of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n\n4.  **Applying Small-Angle Approximation:** The problem allows the use of the approximation sin(θ) ≈ θ. The condition for the n-th minimum becomes:\n    (2π / λ) * a * θₙ = uₙ\n    where θₙ is the angular position of the n-th minimum and uₙ is the n-th non-zero root of J₁(x).\n\n5.  **Solving for Angular Position:** The angular position of the n-th minimum is:\n    θₙ = uₙ * (λ / (2π * a))\n\n6.  **Calculating the Angular Distance:** The quantity of interest is the angular distance between the first two minima, Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [u₂ * (λ / (2π * a))] - [u₁ * (λ / (2π * a))]\n    Δθ = (u₂ - u₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)\n\n7.  **Using Values for Bessel Zeros:** The first two non-zero zeros of J₁(x) are approximately:\n    *   u₁ ≈ 3.8317\n    *   u₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** We substitute these values to find the numerical coefficient for (λ / a).\n    Coefficient = (u₂ - u₁) / (2π) ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.50679...\n\n    The code output you provided (`0.506730...`) and the calculation here both yield a value that is best approximated by 0.506. The small differences are due to the precision of the root values used in the calculation, but the conclusion is the same.\n\n9.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    *   A) 1.220 λ/a\n    *   B) 0.500 λ/a\n    *   C) 0.610 λ/a\n    *   D) 0.506 λ/a\n\n    The calculated coefficient of approximately 0.506 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
