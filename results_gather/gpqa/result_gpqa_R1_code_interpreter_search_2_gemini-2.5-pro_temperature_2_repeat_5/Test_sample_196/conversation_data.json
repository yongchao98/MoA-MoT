    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from spectroscopic data.**\n\n1.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which often exists as a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, specifically from a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks indicate the presence of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This extremely deshielded and broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the more upfield signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl group signals:** Let's assemble the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: `CH₃-CH₂-`.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: `CH₃-CH-`.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2H is the -CH₂- group. From the triplet at 0.9 ppm, we know it's next to that -CH₃.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1H is the -CH- group. It is attached to the benzene ring (which explains its downfield shift) and also coupled to the -CH₃ group (from 1.4 ppm) and the -CH₂- group (from 1.7 ppm).\n        *   Connecting the fragments: The -CH- group is attached to the ring, a -CH₃ group, and a -CH₂- group. The -CH₂- group is attached to another -CH₃ group. This forms a **sec-butyl** group: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure of Compound X:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is a benzoic acid molecule with a *sec*-butyl group at the para (position 4) position.\n    *   The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n**Part 2: Determining the product of the reaction.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n2.  **Function of the reagents:** The combination of red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Most importantly for this problem, it completely reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the existing alkyl (sec-butyl) group are unreactive under these conditions.\n3.  **Predict the product:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Final Product: The benzene ring will have a *sec*-butyl group at one position and a methyl group at the para position. The name of the product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Part 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is *sec*-butyl, not the isomeric *iso*-butyl group.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
