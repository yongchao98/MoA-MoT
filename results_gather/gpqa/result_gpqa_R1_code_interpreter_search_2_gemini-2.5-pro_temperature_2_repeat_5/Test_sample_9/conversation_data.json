    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the options provided:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline reference. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this as ρ_Earth.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density. So, the density of this planet is ≈ ρ_Earth.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This describes a \"super-Earth\". A key principle in planetary science is that for planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger self-gravity. This increased gravity compresses the planet's material (rock and iron, in Earth's case) to a greater degree, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet's density will be greater than Earth's density (ρ_c > ρ_Earth).\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This describes a \"sub-Earth\". Following the same logic as above, but in reverse, a less massive planet has weaker self-gravity. This leads to less compression of its material compared to Earth. Consequently, its overall density will be lower than Earth's density (ρ_d < ρ_Earth).\n\n2.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density of (a) = ρ_Earth\n    *   Density of (b) ≈ ρ_Earth\n    *   Density of (c) > ρ_Earth\n    *   Density of (d) < ρ_Earth\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    By comparing the densities, it is clear that the planet described in option (c) is the densest. The greater mass causes significant gravitational compression, increasing its density above that of Earth. The other planets are either as dense as Earth or less dense.\n\nTo provide a more quantitative feel, we can use the mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is approximately R ∝ M^0.27 (where R is radius and M is mass).\n*   Density (ρ) is Mass / Volume, so ρ ∝ M / R³.\n*   Substituting the mass-radius relation: ρ ∝ M / (M^0.27)³ = M / M^0.81 = M^0.19.\n*   This shows that density increases with mass.\n*   For planet (c), M = 5 M_Earth, so its density would be roughly (5)^0.19 ≈ 1.35 times Earth's density.\n*   For planet (d), M = 0.5 M_Earth, so its density would be roughly (0.5)^0.19 ≈ 0.88 times Earth's density.\nThis calculation confirms the qualitative reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the planet with the highest density is the one with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass.\n\n<<<D>>>"
