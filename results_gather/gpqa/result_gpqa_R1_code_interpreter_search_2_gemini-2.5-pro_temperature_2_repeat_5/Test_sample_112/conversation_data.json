    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the C=O of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to **vinyl-hydrogens** confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group, as vinyl hydrogens are those attached directly to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined spectral data strongly indicates the presence of two key functional groups: a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** and an **alkene (C=C)**.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid functional group means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: C) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygens don't affect the calculation).\n    *   Our identified functional groups require a specific DoU: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C in the alkene. Therefore, the total DoU must be 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a given chemical formula string like 'C6H12O2'.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    counts = {elem: int(count) if count else 1 for elem, count in parts}\n    \n    C = counts.get('C', 0)\n    H = counts.get('H', 0)\n    # The general formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    # For CH O compounds, it simplifies.\n    dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n    return dou\n\nformula_C = 'C6H12O2'\nformula_D = 'C6H10O2'\n\ndou_C = calculate_dou(formula_C)\ndou_D = calculate_dou(formula_D)\n\nprint(f\"The degree of unsaturation for {formula_C} is: {dou_C}\")\nprint(f\"The degree of unsaturation for {formula_D} is: {dou_D}\")\nprint(\"\\nOur analysis of the spectra indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid (1 DoU) and an alkene (1 DoU), for a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct formula must be the one with a DoU of 2.\")\n\n```\nThe degree of unsaturation for C6H12O2 is: 1.0\nThe degree of unsaturation for C6H10O2 is: 2.0\n\nOur analysis of the spectra indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid (1 DoU) and an alkene (1 DoU), for a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\nTherefore, the correct formula must be the one with a DoU of 2.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that C6H12O2 has a Degree of Unsaturation of 1, which is not enough to account for both an alkene and a carboxylic acid. C6H10O2 has a Degree of Unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches our structural deductions from the spectral data. Therefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Based on the spectral data and the calculated degrees of unsaturation:\n\n*   **FTIR and Mass Spec evidence:** The very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the mass spec fragment at m/z=45 all strongly point to the presence of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) functional group. This group contains two oxygen atoms, eliminating options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O). A carboxylic acid also contains one degree of unsaturation due to the C=O double bond.\n*   **FTIR and NMR evidence:** The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirm the existence of an **alkene** (C=C) functional group. This group adds a second degree of unsaturation to the molecule.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Analysis:** The compound must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O and one for the C=C).\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **C6H12O2:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n    *   **C6H10O2:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n\nThe formula **C6H10O2** is the only one with two degrees of unsaturation, which matches the evidence for a carboxylic acid and an alkene. An example of such a compound would be hex-5-enoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
