    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation involving buffer solutions and acid-base equilibria.\n\n1.  **Identify the species and their roles**:\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   In water, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4-. H2PO4- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, which can act as a weak acid.\n    *   In water, Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2-, and 2H2O. HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion, which is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n    *   Together, the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2- form a buffer solution.\n    *   We need to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-.\n\n2.  **Determine the relevant equilibria**:\n    The phosphoric acid (H3PO4) dissociation occurs in three steps:\n    *   (1) H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4-      (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n    *   (2) H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-    (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n    *   (3) HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-    (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\n    The buffer in our solution is composed of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, so the pH will be determined primarily by the second equilibrium (Ka2). The concentration of orthophosphate (PO4^3-) will be determined by the third equilibrium (Ka3).\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components**:\n    *   First, calculate the number of moles of each compound.\n        *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Then, calculate the concentration of each ion in the 200.00 cm3 (0.200 L) solution.\n        *   [H2PO4-] = (1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol) / 0.200 L\n        *   [HPO4^2-] = (1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol) / 0.200 L\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer**:\n    *   We can use the equilibrium expression for Ka2 to find [H+].\n    *   Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   Rearranging for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]**:\n    *   Now, we use the equilibrium expression for Ka3.\n    *   Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   Rearranging for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    *   We can use the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H+ calculated in the previous steps.

    "This problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in a solution containing KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. This solution is a buffer system involving the second and third dissociation equilibria of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄).\n\n**1. Understand the chemical system**\n\n*   The solution contains two salts: KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.\n*   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely in water to give K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate ion). H₂PO₄⁻ acts as a weak acid in this buffer pair.\n*   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates completely in water to give 2Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate ion). HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\n*   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n**2. List the relevant equilibria and constants**\n\nPhosphoric acid has three dissociation steps:\n*   H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻  (Ka₁ = 7.5 x 10⁻³)\n*   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸)\n*   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻  (Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²)\n\nSince our solution contains a mixture of H₂PO₄⁻ (the acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (the base), the pH of the solution is primarily controlled by the second equilibrium (governed by Ka₂). The species we want to find, PO₄³⁻, is produced in the third equilibrium (governed by Ka₃).\n\n**3. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the molar concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ in the solution.\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n*   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol\n\nMoles of KH₂PO₄ (source of H₂PO₄⁻):\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n\nConcentration of H₂PO₄⁻:\n[H₂PO₄⁻] = moles / volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n\nMoles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (source of HPO₄²⁻):\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\nConcentration of HPO₄²⁻:\n[HPO₄²⁻] = moles / volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]**\n\nWe can use the equilibrium expression for Ka₂ to determine the [H⁺] of the buffer solution.\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**5. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\n\nNow, we use the equilibrium expression for Ka₃. The [H⁺] is the value we just calculated for the buffer, and we can assume the [HPO₄²⁻] is its initial concentration because Ka₃ is very small, meaning very little HPO₄²⁻ dissociates.\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\nRearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis matches the result from the code interpreter. Comparing this value with the given options:\nA) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>"
