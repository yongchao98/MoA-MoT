    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN is a source of the cyanide nucleophile (CN⁻).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a classic cyanohydrin formation. The reaction proceeds in two steps:\n        1.  **Nucleophilic attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate.\n            CH₃CH₂C(=O)CH₃ + CN⁻  ⇌  CH₃CH₂C(O⁻)(CN)CH₃\n        2.  **Protonation:** The alkoxide intermediate is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final neutral cyanohydrin product. This requires a source of protons (H⁺).\n            CH₃CH₂C(O⁻)(CN)CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃CH₂C(OH)(CN)CH₃\n    *   **Identifying Reagent A:** Reagent A must be the proton source. Let's look at the options for A.\n        *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents a hydronium ion, which is the species present in an aqueous acid solution. It is an excellent proton source for protonating the alkoxide intermediate. This step is often performed as an acidic workup after the initial reaction with cyanide.\n        *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction. It is not used to facilitate cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   Therefore, **A must be H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Reactants:** The starting material is a nitrile (specifically, an α-hydroxy nitrile).\n    *   **Product:** The final product is a carboxylic acid (an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Transformation:** The nitrile group (-C≡N) is converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires water and is typically catalyzed by a strong acid or a strong base, usually with heating. The reaction proceeds via an amide intermediate.\n        R-C≡N + 2 H₂O  ---(Acid or Base catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃ (or NH₄⁺)\n    *   **Identifying Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n        *   **CH₃COOH:** Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the hydrolysis, the reaction would be extremely slow and inefficient.\n        *   **HCl:** Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. Strong mineral acids like HCl or H₂SO₄ are the standard reagents used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The presence of (H₂O) indicates the reaction is carried out in an aqueous solution.\n    *   Therefore, **B must be HCl**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the results and select the correct option.**\n    *   From our analysis, A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect B)\n        *   B) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect A and B)\n        *   C) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl (Incorrect A)\n        *   D) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl (Correct A and B)\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
