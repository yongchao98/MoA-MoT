    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one existing chiral center at carbon C-5, with a defined (S) configuration.\n    The structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. The C-5 carbon is chiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a powerful reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new chiral center. The attack of the hydride ion (H-) can occur from two different faces of the planar carbonyl group. Since there is already a chiral center in the molecule (at C-5), these two pathways are not energetically equivalent. The attack is diastereoselective, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products. The existing stereocenter at C-5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The two products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are two distinct compounds that are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. This molecule has two new chiral centers at C-2 and C-4. We need to determine the possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's consider the (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers. The two stereocenters (C-2 and C-4) are constitutionally equivalent. In such cases, the (R, S) form is a meso compound, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same single, achiral, meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** This reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers: the (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, its enantiomer (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the diastereomeric meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: List all the unique compounds in the final mixture.**\nThe final mixture contains the products from both reactions.\nFrom Reaction I (2 compounds):\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\nFrom Reaction II (3 compounds):\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nIn total, there are 5 different chemical compounds (stereoisomers) in the mixture.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC.**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity).\n*   It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers as they have different physical properties.\n\nLet's analyze the 5 compounds:\n*   Compound 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   Compound 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have the same polarity and will not be separated. They will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   Compound 5 is the meso-diol. It is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. Therefore, it has a different polarity and will be separated from the peak containing compounds 3 and 4. This gives another **single peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C8H18O2, methoxy-alcohols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2, diols). They have very different structures and polarities and will be well-separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of peaks in chiral HPLC.**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, a good chiral column can separate all different stereoisomers.\n\nLet's analyze the 5 compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> a unique chiral molecule -> 1 peak\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> a unique chiral molecule, diastereomer to 1 -> 1 peak\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> a unique chiral molecule -> 1 peak\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> the enantiomer of 3, will be separated by the chiral column -> 1 peak\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> an achiral molecule, but a unique stereoisomer (diastereomer to 3 and 4) -> 1 peak\n\nSince all five compounds are structurally unique stereoisomers, and a chiral column can differentiate between both enantiomers and diastereomers, we expect to see a peak for each compound.\n*   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis shows there will be **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
