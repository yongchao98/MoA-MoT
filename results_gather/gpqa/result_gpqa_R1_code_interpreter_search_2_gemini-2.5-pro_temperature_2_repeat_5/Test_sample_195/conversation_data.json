    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    For a conservative force like the one described by Hooke's Law ($F=-kx$), the total energy of the system is conserved. In relativistic mechanics, we must use the relativistic definition of energy.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy of the system.**\n    The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the particle in the potential field is the sum of its relativistic energy ($E_{particle}$) and its potential energy ($U(x)$).\n    *   The relativistic energy of the particle is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the rest mass, $v$ is the speed, and $c$ is the speed of light. Note that $E_{particle}$ includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$).\n    *   The potential energy of the harmonic oscillator is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n    *   Therefore, the conserved total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy to two key points in the oscillation.**\n    The total energy must be the same at every point in the particle's path. We will compare the energy at the point of maximum amplitude with the energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **State 1: At maximum amplitude (x = A)**\n        At this point, the particle momentarily stops, so its speed is $v=0$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   The particle's energy is $E_{particle} = 1 \\cdot mc^2 = mc^2$.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total, 1} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **State 2: At the equilibrium position (x = 0)**\n        At this point, the potential energy is zero, and the particle's speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The particle's energy is $E_{particle} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$.\n        *   The potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total, 2} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since energy is conserved, $E_{total, 1} = E_{total, 2}$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n    First, let's solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n\n    Isolate the speed term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n    Finally, substitute the expression we found for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
