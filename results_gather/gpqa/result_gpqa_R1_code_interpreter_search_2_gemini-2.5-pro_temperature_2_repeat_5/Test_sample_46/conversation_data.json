    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 from the given spectral data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2 group). The two bands correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). The position is consistent with an ester (typically 1735-1750 cm-1) that is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which tends to lower the frequency slightly.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum\nThe NMR spectrum gives us information about the different types of protons and their connectivity.\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and the 't' (triplet) indicates they have 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons, and the 'q' (quartet) indicates they have 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) next to a methyl group (-CH3-).\n    *   **Putting these two signals together (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm), we can identify an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).** The high chemical shift of the methylene group (4.5 ppm) indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-COO-**CH2**CH3) or an ether (-O-**CH2**CH3). This supports the ester identified from the IR data.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This 'bs' (broad singlet) for 2 protons is typical for the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group, which confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The region from 6.5-8.5 ppm is the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two substituents are different electronically, causing the two sets of protons on the ring to have different chemical shifts.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\nLet's combine the pieces:\n1.  A **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**\n2.  A **primary amine group** (-NH2)\n3.  An **ethyl ester group** (-COOCH2CH3)\n\nThe only way to assemble these fragments with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 is to place the amine group and the ester group at opposite (para) positions on the benzene ring. This gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this proposed structure against the data and the other options:\n\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** An -NH2 group and a -COOCH2CH3 group are para on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2. Correct.\n    *   **IR:** Has a primary -NH2 and a conjugated ester C=O. Correct.\n    *   **NMR:**\n        *   -NH2 at 4.0 ppm. Correct.\n        *   -O-CH2CH3 group gives a quartet at ~4.5 ppm and a triplet at ~1.2 ppm. Correct.\n        *   Para-disubstituted ring gives two doublets. The -NH2 is an electron-donating group, so it shields the protons ortho to it (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm). The -COOEt is an electron-withdrawing group, so it deshields the protons ortho to it (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm). This matches the data perfectly.\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a *meta*-substituted ring, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR signal, not two clean doublets. Also, the C=O stretch for a primary amide is typically lower (~1650 cm-1).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H peak in the IR, not two. It would also have only one proton for the amide NH signal in the NMR, not two.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ester group is -OOCCH2CH3. Here, the CH2 group is attached to the carbonyl, not the oxygen. Its chemical shift would be much lower, around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The signal at 4.5 ppm is definitive for a -O-CH2- arrangement.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe provided spectral data are fully consistent with the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
