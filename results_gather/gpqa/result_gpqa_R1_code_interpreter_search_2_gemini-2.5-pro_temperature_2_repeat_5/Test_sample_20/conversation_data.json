    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A):**\n    *   Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens. The presence of two adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups makes these alpha-hydrogens very acidic and easily removable. This compound readily tautomerizes to its much more stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n    *   Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B):**\n    *   Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is `CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3`. Let's examine the carbon at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate (`CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`). The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) and a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane or center of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   A = benzoquinone\n    *   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
