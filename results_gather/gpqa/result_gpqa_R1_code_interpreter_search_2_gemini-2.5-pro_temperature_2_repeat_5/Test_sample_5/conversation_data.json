    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential**\n    The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    $V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 \\cos^2(θ)$\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often best to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's convert this potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to see if it simplifies.\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates**\n    The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    *   $x = r \\cos(θ)$\n    *   $y = r \\sin(θ)$\n    *   $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    From these, we can identify a key term in the potential:\n    *   $x^2 = (r \\cos(θ))^2 = r^2 \\cos^2(θ)$\n\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (x^2)$\n\n    Simplify the expression by combining like terms:\n    $V(x, y) = 1/2 k x^2 + 1/2 k y^2 + 3/2 k x^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2) k x^2 + 1/2 k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (4/2) k x^2 + 1/2 k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + 1/2 k y^2$\n\n3.  **Identify the Physical System**\n    The potential in Cartesian coordinates is:\n    $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\n    where $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$ and $V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2$.\n\n    This shows that the potential is a sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one along the x-axis and one along the y-axis. The total Hamiltonian of the system is separable: $H = H_x + H_y$. This means we can solve the Schrödinger equation for each dimension independently and add the energies to get the total energy.\n\n4.  **Solve the 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO)**\n    The standard potential for a 1D QHO is $V_{HO}(q) = 1/2 m' ω^2 q^2$, where $m'$ is the mass and ω is the angular frequency. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by $E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω$, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n    **For the x-direction:**\n    $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$. We can write this in the standard form $1/2 m ω_x^2 x^2$:\n    $1/2 m ω_x^2 x^2 = 2kx^2$\n    $m ω_x^2 = 4k$\n    $ω_x^2 = 4k/m \\implies ω_x = \\sqrt{4k/m} = 2\\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ(2\\sqrt{k/m})$\n\n    **For the y-direction:**\n    $V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2$. This is already in the standard form $1/2 m ω_y^2 y^2$:\n    $1/2 m ω_y^2 y^2 = 1/2 ky^2$\n    $m ω_y^2 = k$\n    $ω_y^2 = k/m \\implies ω_y = \\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n    The total energy E is the sum of the energies from the independent x and y motions:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n    $E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ(2\\sqrt{k/m}) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n    Now, let's simplify this expression by factoring out the common term $ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$:\n    $E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n    $E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n    $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n    The quantum numbers $n_x$ and $n_y$ can be any non-negative integer ($n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    Let's compare this with the given options:\n    A) $E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ\\sqrt(k/m))$\n    B) $E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ\\sqrt(k/m))$\n    C) $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ\\sqrt(k/m)$\n    D) $E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ\\sqrt(k/m))$\n\n    Our result matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
