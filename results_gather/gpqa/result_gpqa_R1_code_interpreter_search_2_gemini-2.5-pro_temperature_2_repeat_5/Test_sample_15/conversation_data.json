    "A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, a molecule with chiral centers can be achiral if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such a compound is called a meso compound). Conversely, a molecule without chiral centers can be chiral (due to axial, planar, or helical chirality), but this is less common.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `ClHC=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The atoms of the double bond are sp2-hybridized and lie in a plane. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (`3aR,7aS`) and the stereochemistry of a double bond (`E`).\n    *   The designation of specific R/S configurations implies that the molecule is a single stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer is, by definition, optically active unless it is a meso compound. Given the complex, bridged structure with low symmetry, it is not a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetrical, with identical substituents on both chiral carbons (H, CH3, COOH).\n    *   The configuration is `(R,S)`. For a molecule with two identical chiral centers, the (R,S) stereoisomer (which is identical to the (S,R) stereoisomer) is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds possess an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion can be found in the staggered conformation) which makes them achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is the diastereomer of the compound above. It has the `(2R,3R)` configuration.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` stereoisomer. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` molecules are non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   This stereoisomer lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=`, and 4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. The two paths around the ring from C1 are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name `(R)` specifies that this is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This represents the all-cis isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   In its most stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups occupy equatorial positions.\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one of the C-OH groups and the CH2 group directly opposite it.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CHCH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers (sp3 carbon with four different groups).\n    *   The ketone carbon is sp2. The cyclopentyl ring has no chiral centers. In the `3-methylbutyl` group, the carbon at position 3, `(CH3)2**CH**CH2-`, is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the `-CH2-CO-cyclopentyl` group. Since it has two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and can adopt conformations with a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\nIn summary, we have identified three optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nSo, the total number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
