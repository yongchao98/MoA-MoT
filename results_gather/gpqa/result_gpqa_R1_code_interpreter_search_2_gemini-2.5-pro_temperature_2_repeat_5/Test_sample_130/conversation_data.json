    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile (Anhydride):** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   ¹H NMR: It has a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent. A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is in the alkene region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: It has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region). Two peaks mean there are only two types of carbon atoms in the molecule.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the highly symmetrical structure of **maleic anhydride**. Dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid) gives maleic anhydride. It has two equivalent alkene protons (giving one ¹H singlet) and two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons, giving two ¹³C peaks). Its formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n    ```\n        H   H\n         \\ /\n          C=C\n         /   \\\n      O=C     C=O\n        \\   /\n          O\n     Maleic Anhydride\n    ```\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Let's determine its molecular formula. The cyclopentadiene ring core is C₅. There are four methyl (CH₃) groups attached to positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Position 5 is a CH₂ group.\n    *   Carbon count: 5 (ring) + 4 (methyls) = 9 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogen count: 12 (from 4 methyl groups) + 2 (from the CH₂ group) = 14 hydrogens.\n    *   The formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **Product Formula:** Let's verify the molecular formula of the product.\n    *   C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃.\n    *   This matches the molecular formula given in the problem for the products.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction typically forms two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The **endo product** is usually the major product because it is formed faster (it's the kinetic product). In the endo isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the molecule's main bridge.\n    *   The **exo product** is usually the minor product (but is often more stable thermodynamically). The anhydride ring points away from the bridge.\n    *   Since the problem mentions a major and a minor product, these correspond to the *endo* and *exo* adducts, respectively.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and Key Spatial Relationships**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the endo (major) and exo (minor) products. The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n*   The `CH₂` group from the cyclopentadiene becomes the one-carbon bridge (at C7).\n*   The two protons from maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_a**) end up on the bicyclic framework.\n*   The four methyl groups are attached to the framework.\n*   The key difference between the isomers is the position of the anhydride ring relative to the C7 `CH₂` bridge.\n\n*   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring, and thus its protons (**H_a**), is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the C7 `CH₂` bridge. This brings **H_a** close in space to one of the protons on the `CH₂` bridge.\n*   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring and its protons (**H_a**) are on the opposite side (*anti*) of the system from the C7 `CH₂` bridge. Here, **H_a** is far from the `CH₂` bridge protons but is brought close to the methyl groups located on the same face of the molecule.\n\n**4. Interpret the NOESY NMR Data**\n\n*   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the **minor product**.\"\n*   This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* isomer but not in the *exo* isomer.\n*   Based on our structural analysis:\n    *   The interaction between the anhydride protons (**H_a**) and a proton on the C7 bridge exists *only* in the **endo (major)** product.\n    *   The interaction between the anhydride protons (**H_a**) and the methyl groups is strong *only* in the **exo (minor)** product.\n*   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak in the major product connects the **anhydride protons** with one of the **bridge `CH₂` protons**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Answer**\n\nLet's assign the signals described in the options to the protons in the molecule, based on chemical intuition:\n*   **`~3.5 ppm` (2H singlet):** Protons on carbons adjacent to a carbonyl group and in a strained ring system are deshielded. The two anhydride protons (**H_a**) are equivalent by symmetry and have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a 2H singlet. This assignment is reasonable.\n*   **`~1.5 ppm` (1H doublet):** The C7 `CH₂` bridge protons are in a saturated, strained environment. They are diastereotopic (not equivalent) and will split each other into doublets. A shift around 1.5 ppm is typical.\n*   **`~1.7 ppm` (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). ~1.7 ppm is a characteristic shift for vinylic methyls.\n*   **`~1.0 ppm` (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are more shielded than the vinylic methyls, so a shift of ~1.0 ppm is appropriate.\n\nThe key NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects:\n*   The anhydride protons (`2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`)\n*   and one of the bridge `CH₂` protons (`1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`)\n\nNow we look at the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - (Bridgehead methyls <> Vinylic methyls)\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - (Bridgehead methyls <> Bridge CH proton)\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - (**Bridge CH proton <> Anhydride protons**)\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - (Vinylic methyls <> Anhydride protons) - *This interaction is characteristic of the minor (exo) product.*\n\nThe interaction unique to the major (endo) product is between the bridge proton and the anhydride protons. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
