    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** Both reactions yield a lactone named `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   `pyran`: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n    *   `-2-one`: A carbonyl group at position 2 (next to the ring oxygen, which is position 1).\n    *   `tetrahydro`: The ring is saturated.\n    *   `4-ethyl`: An ethyl group is at position 4 of the ring.\n    *   This is a delta-lactone (6-membered ring), which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   **Precursor:** The precursor that cyclizes to form the product is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The chiral center in the starting material (on C3 of the pentanoic acid chain) becomes the chiral center in the product (at C4 of the pyranone ring).\n    *   `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)OH` --(cyclization)--> `(4-ethyl)-lactone`\n*   **Reaction A:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n    *   This implies the reaction produces `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`, which then cyclizes.\n*   **Reaction B:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n    *   This implies the reaction produces `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`, which then cyclizes.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\n*   The options describe the starting materials A and B as stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   Let's decode this IUPAC name: It describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Glutaric acid is a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid. The structure has a free carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu) at the other.\n*   The name `...pentanoic acid` implies the free COOH group is at C1. The substituent `5-isobutoxy-5-oxo...` describes the ester group at C5.\n*   Therefore, the structure is: `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`. The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagent Selectivity**\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is generally unreactive.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction A: LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A):** `(Stereoisomer)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n*   **Reaction:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-HOOC`) is left untouched.\n*   **Intermediate:** `(Stereoisomer)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    *   This is `(Stereoisomer)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`, which is the correct precursor for the 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reduction does not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To get the `(R)`-lactone product, the starting material A must have the `(R)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** `A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction B: BH₃**\n\n*   **Starting Material (B):** `(Stereoisomer)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n*   **Reaction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-HOOC`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n*   **Intermediate:** `(Stereoisomer)-HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n*   **Cyclization:** The `H⁺` workup would promote intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl. The atoms in the ring would be `O(from original COOH)-C1-C2-C3-C4-C5(=O)`. This would form a **seven-membered lactone** (an oxepan-2-one), not the six-membered lactone (`pyran-2-one`) stated in the problem.\n\n***Addressing the Discrepancy***\n\nThere is a clear contradiction in the problem statement for Reaction B. The given starting material, when reacted with BH₃, cannot form the specified product. This is likely an error in the question's design.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question, we should follow the most probable intended logic. The question is likely designed to test the following principles:\n1.  LiBH₄ reduces esters.\n2.  BH₃ reduces acids.\n3.  The stereochemistry at a non-reacting chiral center is retained.\n\nFollowing this logic, we assume that Reaction B is intended to work as planned, despite the structural flaw.\n\n*   **Intended Logic for Reaction B:** `B + BH₃ → (S)-product`. Since stereochemistry is retained, the starting material B must have the `(S)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** `B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Starting Material A:** (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   **Starting Material B:** (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
