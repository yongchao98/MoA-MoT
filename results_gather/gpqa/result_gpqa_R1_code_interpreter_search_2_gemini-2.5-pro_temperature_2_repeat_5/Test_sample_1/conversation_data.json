    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the multi-step synthesis problem.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** trans-cinnamaldehyde. The structure is a benzene ring attached to a propenal group: C₆H₅−CH=CH−CHO. Let's count the carbons: 6 in the phenyl ring, 2 in the -CH=CH- group, and 1 in the aldehyde (-CHO) group, for a total of 9 carbon atoms.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr). This is a Grignard reagent. The methyl group (CH₃) acts as a nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents perform a 1,2-addition to α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. The nucleophilic methyl group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. Subsequent acidic workup (implied in Grignard reactions) protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Transformation:** The aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted into a secondary alcohol containing an additional methyl group (-CH(OH)CH₃).\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is C₆H₅−CH=CH−CH(OH)CH₃ (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol).\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 1:** We start with 9 carbons in cinnamaldehyde and add 1 carbon from the methylmagnesium bromide. Total carbons = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, which is C₆H₅−CH=CH−CH(OH)CH₃, a secondary allylic alcohol.\n*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent used to oxidize secondary alcohols to ketones. It does not affect the carbon-carbon double bond or the phenyl ring.\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is C₆H₅−CH=CH−C(=O)CH₃ (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one).\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 2:** This is an oxidation reaction, which involves the removal of hydrogen atoms. No carbon atoms are added or removed. Therefore, Product 2 has the same number of carbons as Product 1, which is 10.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, which is C₆H₅−CH=CH−C(=O)CH₃, an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the IUPAC name for dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂], commonly known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n*   **Reaction:** This stabilized sulfur ylide reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones via conjugate addition (1,4-addition), which results in cyclopropanation of the carbon-carbon double bond. The ketone group remains unchanged. Essentially, a methylene group (-CH₂-) from the reagent is added across the C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=C double bond in Product 2 is replaced by a cyclopropane ring. The resulting structure is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethanone.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 3:** We start with Product 2, which has 10 carbons. The Corey-Chaykovsky reaction adds one carbon atom (from the methylene group) to the molecule. Total carbons = 10 + 1 = 11.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product, Product 3, contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n*   trans-cinnamaldehyde (9 C)\n*   -> Product 1 (10 C)\n*   -> Product 2 (10 C)\n*   -> Product 3 (11 C)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
