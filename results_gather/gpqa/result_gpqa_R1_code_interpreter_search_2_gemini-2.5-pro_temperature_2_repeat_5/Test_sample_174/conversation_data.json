    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes an oscillating spheroid-shaped charge distribution. The oscillation and the spheroid's symmetry axis are along the z-axis. This system is radiating electromagnetic waves.\n\n2.  **Model the Radiating System:** In electromagnetism, any radiating source whose size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation ($\\lambda$) can be analyzed using a multipole expansion. The simplest and usually dominant term in this expansion is the electric dipole. An oscillating charge distribution, where the center of charge moves back and forth along an axis, creates a time-varying electric dipole moment. The spheroid oscillating along the z-axis can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole with its dipole moment vector, $\\vec{p}$, pointing along the z-axis.\n\n3.  **Recall the Formula for Electric Dipole Radiation:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle ($dP/d\\Omega$) from an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = f(\\lambda, \\theta) = C \\cdot \\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{\\lambda^4} $$\n    where:\n    *   $\\theta$ is the angle between the direction of observation and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n    *   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation.\n    *   $C$ is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment, the speed of light, and the permittivity of free space, but not on $\\theta$ or $\\lambda$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Angular Dependence:**\n    The power radiated is a function of the angle $\\theta$, proportional to $\\sin^2\\theta$.\n    $$ f(\\lambda, \\theta) \\propto \\sin^2\\theta $$\n    The maximum power is radiated when $\\sin^2\\theta$ is at its maximum value. The maximum value of $\\sin^2\\theta$ is 1, which occurs at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    The problem states that this maximum power is $A$. So,\n    $$ A = \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\text{max}} = \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\theta=90^\\circ} = C \\frac{\\sin^2(90^\\circ)}{\\lambda^4} = \\frac{C}{\\lambda^4} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Fraction of Power at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$:**\n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ and express it as a fraction of the maximum power $A$.\n    The power at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\theta=30^\\circ} = C \\frac{\\sin^2(30^\\circ)}{\\lambda^4} $$\n    We know that $A = C/\\lambda^4$. Substituting this into the equation above gives:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\theta=30^\\circ} = A \\cdot \\sin^2(30^\\circ) $$\n    The value of $\\sin(30^\\circ)$ is $1/2$.\n    Therefore, $\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n    So, the power radiated at $30^\\circ$ is $A/4$. The fraction of $A$ is $1/4$.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Wavelength Dependence:**\n    From the formula for dipole radiation, we can see the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength $\\lambda$.\n    $$ f(\\lambda, \\theta) = \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda^4} $$\n    This is the characteristic $\\lambda^{-4}$ dependence of dipole radiation, famously responsible for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue. Thus, a possible form for the function $f$ includes the factor $\\lambda^{-4}$.\n\n7.  **Combine the Results and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is $1/4$.\n    *   A possible form for the functional dependence on wavelength is $\\lambda^{-4}$.\n\n    Now, let's look at the given options:\n    A) 1/2, $\\lambda^{-4}$\n    B) 3/4, $\\lambda^{-6}$\n    C) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-3}$\n    D) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-4}$\n\n    Option D matches both of our findings.\n\n<<<D>>>"
