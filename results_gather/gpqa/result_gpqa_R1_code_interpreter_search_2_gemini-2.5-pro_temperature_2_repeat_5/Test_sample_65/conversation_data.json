    "SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) with a tower of higher-dimensional operators. These operators represent the low-energy effects of new physics at some high-energy scale Î›. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian follows a set of principles. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in the theory of special relativity. Any realistic quantum field theory (QFT) describing particle physics, including the Standard Model and its effective field theory extensions, is required to be Lorentz invariant. The operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry**: This is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz symmetry and spacetime translations. The SMEFT Lagrangian is constructed to be invariant under the Poincare group. This ensures that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers and at all points in spacetime. This is a fundamental assumption of the SMEFT framework.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry**: This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most notably in the weak interactions described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it must be able to accommodate the known CP violation of the SM. Furthermore, the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Therefore, CP is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT. Some operators can be CP-violating.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry**: This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must have CPT symmetry. The SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT. Therefore, it must respect CPT symmetry. While individual operators might violate C, P, or T, the overall theory described by the Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators and the theory as a whole in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry is not a required symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
