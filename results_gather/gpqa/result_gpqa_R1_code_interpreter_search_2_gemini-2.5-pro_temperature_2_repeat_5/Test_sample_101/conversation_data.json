The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background.

    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Goal:** The goal is to track cells expressing a specific receptor after a developmental interaction. This is achieved using a Cre-Lox system to turn on a fluorescent reporter (eGFP) fused to the receptor in specific cells.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Genetic Construct:**\n    *   **Promoter:** The CBA promoter drives the expression of the entire bicistronic cassette. CBA is a strong, ubiquitous promoter, so expression itself shouldn't be the issue, especially since it was confirmed by Western blot *in vitro*.\n    *   **First Gene (Ligand):** Ligand ORF -> `loxP-stop-loxP` -> mCherry. Before Cre, only the ligand is made. After Cre recombination in SOX10+ cells, the stop codon is removed, and a Ligand-mCherry fusion protein should be made.\n    *   **IRES:** The Internal Ribosome Entry Site allows ribosomes to start translation of the second gene (the receptor) from the same mRNA molecule. This is crucial for expressing the receptor.\n    *   **Second Gene (Receptor):** Receptor ORF -> `lox2272-stop-lox2272` -> eGFP. Before Cre, only the receptor is made. This was confirmed by the Western blot experiment. The goal is that after Cre recombination in SOX10+ cells, the stop codon is removed, creating a Receptor-eGFP fusion protein.\n\n3.  **Analyze the In Vivo Experiment:**\n    *   A mouse homozygous for the construct is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse.\n    *   SOX10 is a marker for neural crest cells. Therefore, in the neural crest cells of the offspring, Cre recombinase will be expressed.\n    *   Cre recombinase will act on both `loxP` and `lox2272` sites. It will excise the DNA flanked by these sites (the stop cassettes).\n\n4.  **Focus on the Problem:** The expected green signal from the Receptor-eGFP fusion is *absent*. We need to find the most likely molecular reason for this failure.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Molecular Biology of Cre-Lox:**\n    *   **A) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** This is unlikely. The CBA promoter is strong, and the Western blot from the *in vitro* transfection confirmed that the construct is capable of producing the receptor protein. The genetic cross with `SOX10-Cre` doesn't remove the promoter; it only adds the Cre enzyme to modify the construct *after* it has been transcribed.\n    *   **B) The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is a critical point to consider. When Cre recombinase excises the DNA between two lox sites, it leaves behind a single lox site \"scar\". Standard lox sites (including loxP and its variant lox2272) are 34 base pairs (bp) long. The genetic code is read in codons of 3 base pairs. For the protein sequence to continue uninterrupted from the receptor to the eGFP, the length of the intervening DNA scar must be a multiple of 3.\n        *   Let's check the math: 34 divided by 3 is 11 with a remainder of 1.\n        *   This means the 34 bp lox2272 scar introduces a frameshift mutation (+1 bp).\n        *   A frameshift mutation alters every subsequent codon, leading to the wrong amino acids being incorporated and almost always results in a premature stop codon being generated shortly after the mutation site.\n        *   Therefore, the eGFP portion of the mRNA would not be translated correctly, resulting in a non-functional, non-fluorescent peptide or no protein at all. This perfectly explains the absence of a green signal.\n    *   **C) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** If the fusion protein were synthesized correctly but mis-trafficked and stuck in the Golgi apparatus, the eGFP would still be folded and fluorescent. An experimenter using a confocal microscope would see green fluorescence, but it would be localized incorrectly within the cell (e.g., in a perinuclear pattern) instead of at the plasma membrane. The problem states there is *no* green signal observed, making this option incorrect.\n    *   **D) Ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** This describes a biological mode of cell-to-cell signaling. It has no bearing on the molecular biology of protein translation from a specific genetic construct. Whether the interaction is paracrine (between adjacent cells) or autocrine (on the same cell) does not explain why a fusion protein fails to be produced or fluoresce.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The most direct and mechanistically sound explanation is the frameshift mutation caused by the 34 bp lox2272 scar. This prevents the correct translation of the eGFP tag.\n\n<<<B>>>"
