    "*   **Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: First, we need to calculate the concentration of acetic acid after it's been diluted with water.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH): `moles = concentration × volume`\n        `moles = 0.05 mol/L × 0.020 L = 0.001 mol`\n    *   Total volume after dilution: `20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3 = 0.040 L`\n    *   New concentration of acetic acid: `new concentration = moles / new volume`\n        `new concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M`\n\n2.  **Titration Reaction**: The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH -> CH3COONa + H2O.\n\n3.  **Buffer Region**: At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (a weak acid, HA) has reacted to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (A⁻).\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH reacted = `0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol`\n    *   Moles of CH3COONa formed = `0.00025 mol`\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH remaining = `0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol`\n\n4.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**: Since we have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, we have a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n    `pH = pKa + log([A⁻] / [HA])`\n    *   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n        `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73`\n    *   The ratio `[A⁻] / [HA]` can be calculated using the mole ratio since they are in the same volume:\n        `ratio = moles of A⁻ / moles of HA = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3`\n    *   Now, calculate the pH:\n        `pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3) ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253`\n        Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n*   **Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Equivalence Point Conditions**: At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been neutralized by the NaOH. This means 0.001 mol of NaOH has been added, and 0.001 mol of the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa), has been formed.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added: `volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³`\n    *   Total volume of the solution: `volume of diluted acid + volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L`\n    *   Concentration of the conjugate base (CH3COO⁻) at the equivalence point:\n        `concentration = moles / total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M`\n\n2.  **Hydrolysis of Conjugate Base**: The acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolyze) to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n    `CH3COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH3COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n\n3.  **Calculating pOH and pH**: We need to find the concentration of OH⁻ to determine the pH. We use the Kb for the acetate ion.\n    *   Calculate Kb from Ka: `Kb = Kw / Ka`, where Kw (the ion product of water) is 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n        `Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰`\n    *   Set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction: `Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]`\n        Let `x` be the equilibrium concentration of [OH⁻]. Then, [CH3COOH] = `x` and [CH3COO⁻] = `0.02 - x`. Since Kb is very small, we can approximate `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n        `5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / 0.02`\n        `x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹`\n        `x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M`\n    *   Calculate pOH: `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48`\n    *   Calculate pH: `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52`\n        The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Calculation for 25% titration ---\n# pKa = -log(Ka)\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of moles [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Calculation for equivalence point ---\n# Initial moles of acid before dilution\nmoles_acid_initial = 0.05 * 0.020 # M * L\n# This is also the moles of conjugate base (A-) at the equivalence point\nmoles_A_minus = moles_acid_initial\n\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point\nvol_NaOH = moles_A_minus / 0.1 # L\n# Total volume at equivalence point = initial diluted volume + volume of NaOH\ntotal_vol = (0.020 + 0.020) + vol_NaOH # L\n# Concentration of A- at equivalence point\nconc_A_minus = moles_A_minus / total_vol\n\n# Hydrolysis of A-: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# Kb = Kw / Ka\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Kb = [HA][OH-] / [A-] ≈ x^2 / conc_A_minus\n# x = [OH-]\n# We solve for x = sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\n\n# pOH = -log10([OH-])\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\n# pH = 14 - pOH\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The calculated pH at 25% titration is {pH_25:.2f}.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated pH at the equivalence point is {pH_eq:.2f}.\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Detailed Reasoning and Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles and Concentration after Dilution:**\n    *   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n        *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02000 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n        *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol\n\n    *   **Concentration after dilution:**\n        *   Initial volume of acid = 20.00 cm³\n        *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n        *   Total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n        *   New concentration of CH₃COOH = Moles / New Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n2.  **Calculate pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution.\n    *   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: `pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`\n    *   First, find the pKa:\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base ([A⁻]) to the acid ([HA]) is the same as the ratio of their moles.\n        *   Ratio = [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n    *   Now, calculate the pH:\n        *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n        *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n        *   pH ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, **pH at 25% titration is 4.26.**\n\n3.  **Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been reacted with NaOH. The solution now contains 0.00100 mol of the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n    *   **Volume of NaOH added:**\n        *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n    *   **Total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:**\n        *   Volume = (Volume of diluted acid) + (Volume of NaOH added)\n        *   Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    *   **Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point:**\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water:\n        `CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide concentration, [OH⁻]. Let [OH⁻] = x.\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n        *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n        *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n        *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Calculate pOH:\n        *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   Calculate pH:\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, **pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n*   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
