    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an activating group and an *ortho-, para-* director. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) will be directed to the positions ortho (2 and 6) or para (4) to the methyl group. Due to steric hindrance, the *para* product is typically the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction. MnO₂ in acidic medium is an oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing the benzylic methyl group. While strong oxidation could convert the -CH₃ group to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a subsequent reaction (Step 3) involves acetone and NaOH, which points towards a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This condensation requires an aldehyde or ketone. Therefore, it's most likely that the methyl group is selectively oxidized to an aldehyde group (-CHO). This is a common pattern in multi-step synthesis problems. The nitro group remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, because one of the carbonyl partners (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) has no α-hydrogens and cannot form an enolate. The NaOH (a base) removes an α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol adduct readily dehydrates (loses a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The final product is a conjugated enone. Due to sterics, the more stable *trans* (E) isomer is the major product.\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\n*   **Structure:** The structure of product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    `O₂N-[Benzene Ring]-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** We need to find all the symmetry elements in this molecule.\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    2.  **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no Cₙ axes (for n > 1). For example, a 180° rotation (C₂) along the long axis of the molecule does not result in an identical structure because the p-nitrophenyl group on one end is different from the acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃) on the other.\n    3.  **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n    4.  **Mirror Plane (σ):** The molecule is essentially planar. The benzene ring, the nitro group, the `C=C` double bond, and the `C=O` carbonyl group can all lie in a single plane. If we orient the methyl group such that one of its C-H bonds is in this plane, the other two H atoms will be symmetrically positioned above and below the plane. This plane that contains most of the atoms and bisects the remaining ones is a plane of symmetry (σ).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses only two symmetry elements: the identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ). A molecule with only these two elements belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) C₃: Requires a 3-fold rotation axis.\nB) D₂h: Requires three C₂ axes, a center of inversion, and three mirror planes.\nC) C₂h: Requires a C₂ axis and a horizontal mirror plane.\nD) Cₛ: Requires a single mirror plane.\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is Cₛ.\n\n<<<D>>>"
