    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the measurement:** A measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ for each electron individually. We want to find the joint probability of getting specific eigenvalues for these measurements.\n\n3.  **Identify the target state:** The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the operator $L_z$ is $m_l \\hbar$, where $m_l$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n    *   For the first electron, $L_{1z}$ having an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ means its magnetic quantum number is $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For the second electron, $L_{2z}$ having an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ means its magnetic quantum number is $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the measurement outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state described by the ket $|l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Connect the initial state and the measurement outcome:** In quantum mechanics, the probability of a system in an initial state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$ being found in a final state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ after a measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   In our case, $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   And $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   So, the probability is $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. The term inside the square is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n5.  **Apply the rules of angular momentum coupling:** A key principle in adding angular momenta is that the z-components add up directly. The total angular momentum operator in the z-direction is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   Applying this operator to the initial (coupled) state gives the eigenvalue $m\\hbar$: $L_z|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle = -1 \\hbar |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying this operator to the final (uncoupled) state gives the eigenvalue $(m_1 + m_2)\\hbar$: $L_z(|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle) = (L_{1z} + L_{2z})(|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle) = (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar)(|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle) = -2\\hbar (|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle)$.\n\n6.  **Use orthogonality of eigenstates:** The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ and the final state $|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$ are both eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator, $L_z$. However, they correspond to different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). A fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    *   This means their inner product is zero: $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the probability:** The probability is the square of this inner product.\n    *   $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n8.  **Alternative perspective (Clebsch-Gordan coefficients):** The coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$:\n    $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2, m}^{l_1, l_2, l} |m_1, m_2\\rangle$\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, $C_{m_1, m_2, m}^{l_1, l_2, l}$, are only non-zero if the selection rule $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is satisfied.\n    *   In our case, we are interested in the coefficient for the outcome $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   The total z-component quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$ (i.e., $-2 \\neq -1$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    *   The probability of finding this specific state is the square of the coefficient, which is $0^2=0$.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning lead to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<B>>>"
