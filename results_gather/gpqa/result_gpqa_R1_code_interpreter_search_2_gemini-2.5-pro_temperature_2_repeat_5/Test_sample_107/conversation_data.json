    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical quantities to be calculated.**\n    *   The paramagnetic coupling term, which we will denote as `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle`. This is the energy associated with the Zeeman effect for the orbital magnetic moment.\n    *   The transition energy `\\Delta E` of a photon with a given wavelength.\n\n2.  **Formulate the expression for the paramagnetic coupling term `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle`.**\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the interaction of a magnetic dipole moment `\\vec{\\mu}` with an external magnetic field `\\vec{B}` is `H = - \\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}`.\n    *   The orbital magnetic moment of an electron is `\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}`, where `e` is the elementary charge, `m_e` is the electron mass, and `\\vec{L}` is the orbital angular momentum operator.\n    *   Substituting this into the Hamiltonian gives the paramagnetic coupling term: `H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}`.\n    *   The magnetic field `\\vec{B}` is parallel to the z-axis, so `\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}`. The dot product becomes `\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B`.\n    *   Thus, `H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}L_z B`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian (the energy shifts) are found by replacing the operator `L_z` with its eigenvalues, `m\\hbar`, where `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number and `\\hbar` is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   So, the energy `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle` is given by:\n        `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B`\n    *   The term `\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}` is a fundamental constant known as the Bohr magneton, `\\mu_B`.\n    *   Therefore, the final expression for the energy is `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the expression for the transition energy `\\Delta E`.**\n    *   The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength `\\lambda` by the Planck-Einstein relation: `\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}`, where `h` is the Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n4.  **Calculate the numerical values.**\n    *   We will use a Python script to calculate the values of `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle` and `\\Delta E` using the given parameters and known physical constants.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Magnetic field `B = 1` T.\n        *   Orbital magnetic quantum number `m` is small. We will use `m = 1` for calculation, as the result won't change the order-of-magnitude comparison for any small integer `m`.\n        *   Wavelength `\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}` m.\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   Bohr magneton `\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}` J/T.\n        *   Planck's constant `h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}` JÂ·s.\n        *   Speed of light `c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8` m/s.\n        *   Joule to eV conversion: `1` eV `\\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}` J.\n\n5.  **Execute the calculation using Python.**\n    *   The script will compute `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle` and `\\Delta E` in a common unit (electron-volts, eV) for easy comparison.\n\n```python\n# Constants\ne = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in Coulombs\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34 # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nm_e = 9.1093837015e-31 # Electron mass in kg\nh = 6.62607015e-34    # Planck constant in J*s\nc = 299792458         # Speed of light in m/s\nJ_to_eV_conversion = 1.602176634e-19 # Conversion factor from Joules to eV\n\n# Given values\nB = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1    # A small orbital magnetic quantum number\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# --- Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term <H> ---\n\n# Bohr magneton in J/T\nmu_B_JT = (e * hbar) / (2 * m_e)\n\n# <H> in Joules\nH_joules = mu_B_JT * m * B\n\n# <H> in eV\nH_eV = H_joules / J_to_eV_conversion\n\n# --- Calculate the transition energy Delta_E ---\n\n# Delta_E in Joules\nDelta_E_joules = (h * c) / lambda_m\n\n# Delta_E in eV\nDelta_E_eV = Delta_E_joules / J_to_eV_conversion\n\n# --- Print the results and compare ---\nprint(\"--- Calculations ---\")\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling term <H> = {H_eV:.5e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E     = {Delta_E_eV:.5f} eV\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Comparison ---\")\nprint(f\"The ratio <H> / Delta E is {H_eV/Delta_E_eV:.5e}\")\n\n```\n<execute_result>\n--- Calculations ---\nParamagnetic coupling term <H> = 5.78838e-05 eV\nTransition energy Delta E     = 2.55319 eV\n\n--- Comparison ---\nThe ratio <H> / Delta E is 2.26710e-05\n</execute_result>\n\n6.  **Analyze the results and conclude.**\n    *   The calculated value for the paramagnetic coupling term is `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5}` eV.\n    *   The calculated value for the transition energy is `\\Delta E \\approx 2.55` eV.\n    *   Comparing the two values, `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle` is about five orders of magnitude smaller than `\\Delta E` (since the ratio is `\\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}`).\n    *   This confirms that the energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is a very small perturbation compared to the energy of an electronic transition in the visible spectrum.\n    *   Therefore, the correct relationship is `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An analysis of the results shows:\nThe paramagnetic coupling term is `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5}` eV.\nThe transition energy is `\\Delta E \\approx 2.55` eV.\n\nBy comparing these two values, we can see that `\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle` is much smaller than `\\Delta E`.
