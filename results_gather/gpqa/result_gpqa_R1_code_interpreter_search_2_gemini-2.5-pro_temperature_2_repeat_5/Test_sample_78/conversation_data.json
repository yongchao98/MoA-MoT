    "**1. Analysis of the Product from NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula of Product:** The reaction described is an isomerization or rearrangement of Compound X (C11H12O). Therefore, the product also has the molecular formula C11H12O.\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6.\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in a ketone, likely conjugated with a double bond or aromatic ring. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   There are eight signals for eleven carbons, indicating molecular symmetry.\n    *   Signals in the range **δ 126.9 - 144.1 ppm** are from sp² hybridized carbons (alkene and aromatic). There are 6 such signals corresponding to 8 carbons (two signals are for 2C each).\n    *   A benzene ring has 6 carbons and 4 degrees of unsaturation. This leaves 2 sp² carbons and 1 degree of unsaturation for a C=C double bond.\n    *   The signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** are from sp³ hybridized methyl (-CH₃) carbons.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The two doublets at **δ 7.08 (2H)** and **δ 7.71 (2H)** are a classic `AA'BB'` pattern, strongly suggesting a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The two singlets at **δ 2.28 (3H)** and **δ 2.31 (3H)** correspond to two isolated methyl groups. One is likely attached to the benzene ring (a tolyl group), and the other to the ketone (an acetyl group).\n    *   The two remaining doublets at **δ 6.75 (1H)** and **δ 7.68 (1H)** are characteristic of two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-) that are coupled to each other, likely in a *trans* configuration.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is a methyl group (from one of the methyl singlets, e.g., at δ 2.31, with a ¹³C signal at δ 21.3), forming a **p-tolyl group**.\n    2.  We have a methyl ketone group, **-C(=O)CH₃** (from the C=O at δ 197.7, a methyl singlet at δ 2.28, and a ¹³C signal at δ 28.4).\n    3.  We have a **-CH=CH-** group linking the other two pieces.\n    4.  Combining these fragments gives the structure **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    Let's check its formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. This matches. This α,β-unsaturated ketone structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n    Product Structure:\n    ```\n        CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n    (4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one)\n    ```\n\n**2. Identifying Compound X from the Options**\n\nThe reaction is a rearrangement of Compound X to form the product identified above. The starting material must be an isomer of the product and must contain the necessary structural elements.\n\n*   The most crucial structural feature of the product is the **p-tolyl group**. Any plausible starting material must already contain this group, as forming a C-C bond between a separate methyl group and a phenyl ring under these conditions (DABCO, heat) is not a feasible chemical reaction.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`, which is a p-tolyl group attached to a vinyl group. This option **contains the required p-tolyl group**. The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. This is a plausible candidate.\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The \"styryl\" group is `C₆H₅-CH=CH-`. This option has a phenyl group and a separate methyl group (on the oxirane ring). It **does not contain a p-tolyl group**. The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** This is `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match that of Compound X.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** The `1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl` group is `C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-`. This option has a phenyl group and a separate methyl group (on the vinyl chain). It **does not contain a p-tolyl group**. The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\nBased on this analysis, only **Option A** has the necessary p-tolyl backbone to form the identified product.\n\n**3. The Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe transformation of Compound X (Option A) into the product is an example of an **epoxide-ketone rearrangement**.\n\n*   **Compound X (A):** 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane `[CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH]-CH(O)CH₂`\n*   **Product:** 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one `[CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH]-C(=O)CH₃`\n\nThe reaction converts a terminal epoxide (`R-CH(O)CH₂`) into a methyl ketone (`R-C(=O)CH₃`). This rearrangement is often catalyzed by Lewis acids but can also proceed thermally or with base catalysis, especially at high temperatures like 403 K (130 °C). The basic mechanism involves the opening of the epoxide ring followed by a 1,2-hydride shift. The conjugation of the resulting ketone with the existing double bond and aromatic ring provides a strong thermodynamic driving force for the reaction.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe NMR data clearly indicates the product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Only option A, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, contains the p-tolyl group present in the product. The transformation is a plausible epoxide-ketone rearrangement.\n\n<<<A>>>"
