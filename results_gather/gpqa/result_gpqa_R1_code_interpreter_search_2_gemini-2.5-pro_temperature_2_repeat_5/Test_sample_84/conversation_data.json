    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):**\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n`T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere:\n- `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n- `R_star` is the star's radius.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio of Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both calculations. It also states that they have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`). Therefore, most terms in the equation cancel out:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift caused by the star's wobble. The maximum observed radial velocity of the star, known as the semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ):\n`K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength.\nTherefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), the star's velocity semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and its semi-major axis (`a`) by the following equation (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, `M_p << M_star`):\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant and `M_star` is the star's mass.\n\nLet's rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n`K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nNow we can set up the ratio `a2 / a1` using the formula derived above:\n`a2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n\nThe terms for `G` and `M_star` are constant for both planets and cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n**6. Substitute the Given Values:**\nFrom the problem description:\n- Planet masses: `M_p1 = 7 M_earth`, `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n- Doppler shifts: `Δλ1 = 0.03 Å`, `Δλ2 = 0.04 Å`\n\nFirst, find the ratios:\n- Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n- Velocity semi-amplitude ratio: `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\nNow, substitute these ratios into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nFinally, substitute the value of `a2 / a1` back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\nCalculating the decimal value: `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Planet masses in Earth mass units\nM_p1 = 7.0\nM_p2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shifts in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# 1. The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2) is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\nK_ratio_1_over_2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# 2. The ratio of the planet masses (M_p2/M_p1).\nM_ratio_2_over_1 = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# 3.

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1/T_eq2) is the square root of the inverse ratio of the semi-major axes.\n# T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a)\n# So, T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\nT_eq_ratio_1_over_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"{T_eq_ratio_1_over_2=}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting the same star.\n\n**1.

Forming the Ratio of Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo, so `A1 = A2`. Therefore, all terms except for the semi-major axis (`a`) cancel out:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n**3. Using the Radial Velocity (RV) Method Data:**\nThe maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude `K`. For a planet in a circular orbit (as stated), and assuming the planet's mass `M_p` is much smaller than the star's mass `M_star`, `K` is given by:\n\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\nWhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\n`K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a2 / a1`):**\nNow we can set up the ratio `a2 / a1` using the formula for `a`:\n\n`a2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n\nThe terms for `G` and `M_star` are the same for both planets and cancel out:\n\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes `K1 / K2` is the same as the ratio of their corresponding maximum Doppler shifts `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n\n**5. Plugging in the Given Values:**\n*   Masses: `M_p1 = 7 M_earth`, `M_p2 = 5 M_earth` => `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n*   Doppler shifts: `Δλ1 = 0.03 Å`, `Δλ2 = 0.04 Å` => `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\nNow, substitute these ratios into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n\n`a2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n**6. Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio:**\nFinally, substitute the value of `a2 / a1` back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option D. Note that much of the information given in the problem (star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii) is not needed for the final calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
