    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Concept:** The question asks about the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The key phrase is that nucleons \"behave in the same way as free nucleons.\" We need to identify which of the given assumptions are necessary to create this simplified picture. An interaction with a \"free\" nucleon implies a few things: the interaction happens with just that one nucleon, the nucleon isn't bound by any forces during the interaction, and nothing else in the environment (i.e., the other nucleons) interferes.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Statement:**\n\n    *   **Statement 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n        *   **Reasoning:** If the interaction involved multiple nucleons simultaneously (e.g., meson-exchange currents), or the nucleus as a collective whole, we could not treat any single nucleon as if it were free. The interaction must be localized to a single target nucleon to simplify the problem this way. This is a foundational assumption for the impulse approximation. **This statement is essential.**\n\n    *   **Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n        *   **Reasoning:** This assumption deals with the \"before\" and \"after\" of the main interaction. If the incoming particle could interact with other nucleons before hitting the target (Initial State Interactions), or if the struck nucleon/products could re-interact with the nucleus on the way out (Final State Interactions), the process would be far more complex than a simple \"free\" nucleon scattering. Assuming the nucleus is transparent ignores these complications. This is a key part of the simplified picture, often referred to as the \"Plane Wave Impulse Approximation\". **This statement is essential.**\n\n    *   **Statement 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n        *   **Reasoning:** This statement describes the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself (i.e., its composition from quarks). While models of the nucleon might make this assumption, it is separate from the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation is about how the nucleon behaves *within the nuclear medium*, not its internal physics. One could use the impulse approximation while still employing a sophisticated, relativistic model for the nucleon's internal structure. Therefore, this assumption is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation itself. **This statement is not essential.**\n\n    *   **Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n        *   **Reasoning:** This is the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The idea is that the interaction (the \"impulse\") is extremely fastâ€”so fast that the relatively slow-acting strong nuclear forces that bind the nucleon to the nucleus don't have time to act. During the instant of the interaction, the nucleon's potential energy from the nuclear binding is considered negligible. It effectively behaves as if it's a free particle with whatever momentum it had at that instant. **This statement is essential.**\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Select the Correct Combination:**\n    *   We have identified statements 1, 2, and 4 as essential components that jointly describe the impulse approximation.\n    *   Statement 1 ensures the interaction is with a single nucleon.\n    *   Statement 4 ensures this nucleon is not affected by nuclear binding *during* the interaction.\n    *   Statement 2 ensures that other nucleons do not interfere with the process *before or after* the interaction.\n    *   Together, these three assumptions create the scenario of a clean, one-on-one interaction with a \"free\" nucleon.\n\n    Therefore, the correct combination of statements is 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
