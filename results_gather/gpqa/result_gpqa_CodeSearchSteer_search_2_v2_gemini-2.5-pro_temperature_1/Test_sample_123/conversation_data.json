    "To determine the necessary Lorentz factor, we can use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and the law of exponential decay.\n\n### Analysis of the Physics\n\n1.  **Exponential Decay**: The number of particles, N, that survive after a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is given by the formula N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ), where τ is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame (proper lifetime).\n\n2.  **Time in the Lab Frame**: The particles are produced at the center of the detector and travel outwards. The time it takes for them to reach the detector's inner wall (a distance R = 30 m) in the laboratory's frame of reference is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic (γ >> 1), their velocity 'v' is extremely close to the speed of light 'c'. Therefore, we can approximate `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n3.  **Time Dilation**: Due to relativistic effects, the lifetime of a moving particle as observed from the lab frame (τ_lab) is longer than its proper lifetime (τ_proper). This is known as time dilation. The relationship is given by `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Survival Probability**: The fraction of particles reaching the detector is the probability of a particle surviving for the time `t_lab`. This is calculated using the decay law, but with the time-dilated lifetime:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3, we get:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nLet's define a constant `k = R / (c * τ_proper)`. This constant depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime, which do not change between the two scenarios. The survival equation simplifies to:\n`N / N₀ = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n**Scenario 1: One-third of particles reach the detector**\n\n*   Fraction of surviving particles: N₁/N₀ = 1/3\n*   Lorentz factor: γ₁ = 20\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n\nTo solve for k, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n`k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2: Two-thirds of particles reach the detector**\n\n*   Fraction of surviving particles: N₂/N₀ = 2/3\n*   Lorentz factor: γ₂ (This is what we need to find)\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -k / γ₂`\n`-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -k / γ₂`\n`k = γ₂ * (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n**Solving for the new Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nNow we have two expressions for the constant `k`, so we can set them equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\nSolving for γ₂:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(2) ≈ 0.6931):\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
