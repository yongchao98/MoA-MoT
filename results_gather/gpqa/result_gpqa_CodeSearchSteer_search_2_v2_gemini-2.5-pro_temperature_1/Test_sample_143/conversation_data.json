    "To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the lifetime (τ) of the particle.** The lifetime of an unstable particle is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). The relationship is given by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).** The Lorentz factor accounts for the time dilation effect due to the particle's high velocity. It is the ratio of the particle's energy (E) to its rest mass (m).\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (d).** In the laboratory frame, the mean distance a particle travels before decaying is its lifetime multiplied by its velocity and the Lorentz factor.\n\nHere are the given values:\n*   Production energy ($E_{X}$) = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass ($m_{X}$) = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n*   Width ($\\Gamma_{X}$) = 320 MeV\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n1.  **Lifetime (τ):**\n    First, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). A useful value in particle physics is the product ħc (ħ times the speed of light), which is approximately 197.327 MeV fm. We can use the formula d = (ħc / Γ) * βγ, where β = v/c and βγ is a convenient relativistic term.\n\n2.  **Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    γ = $E_{X}$ / $m_{X}$ = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.667\n\n3.  **Relativistic term (βγ):**\n    We can find βγ using the relation γ = 1 / √(1 - β²). Rearranging this gives:\n    βγ = √(γ² - 1)\n    βγ = √((20/3)² - 1) = √(400/9 - 9/9) = √(391/9) = √391 / 3 ≈ 6.591\n\n4.  **Mean decay distance (d):**\n    Now, we can calculate the mean decay distance using the formula d = (ħc / Γ) * βγ.\n    d = (197.327 MeV fm / 320 MeV) * (√391 / 3)\n    d ≈ (0.6166 MeV fm / MeV) * 6.591\n    d ≈ 4.0645 fm\n    Since 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, the decay distance is approximately 4.0645 * 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
