    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to find the probability.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that a measurement of the observable `P` on a system in state `|ψ⟩` will yield the value 0. In the formalism of quantum mechanics, this probability is calculated using the eigenvalue and eigenvector of the operator corresponding to the measured value.\n\n**2. Define the State and Operator**\n\n*   The unnormalized state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ_u⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n*   The operator for the observable is the matrix `P`:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P**\n\nTo find the possible outcomes of the measurement, we need to find the eigenvalues (λ) of the operator `P` by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n\n`det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = 0`\n\n`-λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) = 0`\n`-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0`\n`-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n`-λ³ + λ = 0`\n`λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n`λ(1 - λ)(1 + λ) = 0`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`. The question asks for the probability of obtaining the result 0, which is one of the eigenvalues.\n\n**4. Find the Normalized Eigenvector for λ = 0**\n\nNext, we find the eigenvector `|φ₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0` by solving `P|φ₀⟩ = 0|φ₀⟩`. Let `|φ₀⟩ = [x, y, z]`.\n\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]`\n\nThis gives a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0  => x = -z`\n3.  `(1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0`\n\nThe eigenvector has the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We can choose `x = 1`, giving the unnormalized eigenvector `[1, 0, -1]`.\n\nNow, we normalize this eigenvector:\n*   Magnitude = `√(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`\n*   The normalized eigenvector `|φ₀⟩` is `(1/√2)[1, 0, -1]`.\n\n**5. Normalize the State Vector |ψ⟩**\n\nThe initial state vector `|ψ_u⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]` must be normalized.\n*   Norm squared = `(-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n*   Norm = `√6`\n*   The normalized state vector `|ψ⟩` is `(1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by the formula `Prob(λ) = |⟨φ_λ|ψ⟩|²`, where `⟨φ_λ|` is the conjugate transpose (bra) of the eigenvector `|φ_λ⟩`.\n\nWe need to calculate `Prob(0) = |⟨φ₀|ψ⟩|²`.\n\n*   `⟨φ₀| = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]` (as a row vector)\n*   `|ψ⟩ = (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]` (as a column vector)\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product `⟨φ₀|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨φ₀|ψ⟩ = ( (1/√2)[1, 0, -1] ) · ( (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1] )`\n`⟨φ₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(1/√6) * [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ]`\n`⟨φ₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√12) * [-1 + 0 - 1]`\n`⟨φ₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nFinally, the probability is the square of the magnitude of this result:\n`Prob(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n<<<C>>>"
