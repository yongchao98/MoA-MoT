    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound E:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A using Hint (a).**\n\n*   Hint (a) describes a Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction converts a ketone or aldehyde into an alkene using a phosphorus ylide.\n*   To find the starting material (Compound A), we must perform a \"retrosynthesis\" on the product, 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. This involves cleaving the double bond and replacing it with a carbonyl group (C=O) on one side and a phosphorus ylide on the other.\n*   Cleaving the `C=C(CH₃)₂` bond on the product and replacing it with a carbonyl group gives us **3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one** as Compound A.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the structure of Compound A with Hint (b).**\n\n*   Hint (b) states that the IR spectrum of Compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm⁻¹.\n*   Ketones in five-membered rings (cyclopentanones) experience ring strain, which causes their carbonyl (C=O) stretching frequency to be higher than in open-chain or six-membered ring ketones.\n*   The typical IR absorption for a cyclopentanone is around 1750 cm⁻¹, which matches the hint perfectly and confirms the five-membered ring structure of Compound A.\n\n**Step 3: Follow the reaction scheme.**\n\n*   **A → B:** Compound A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one) reacts with HCN. This is a nucleophilic addition where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon. The product, Compound B, is **1-cyano-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol** (a cyanohydrin).\n\n*   **B → C:** Compound B is reduced with H₂ in the presence of a Palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the nitrile group (-CN) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂). The product, Compound C, is **1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n*   **C → D → E:** This is a classic ring expansion reaction known as the **Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement**.\n    *   Compound C, a 1-aminomethyl-cycloalkanol, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) to form an unstable diazonium salt (Compound D).\n    *   This diazonium salt immediately loses a molecule of inert nitrogen gas (N₂), creating a carbocation.\n    *   A carbon atom from the cyclopentane ring migrates to the carbocation, expanding the five-membered ring into a six-membered ring. This relieves ring strain and forms a more stable structure.\n    *   The final product, Compound E, is a ketone on the newly formed six-membered ring. The methyl groups, which were at positions 3 and 4 on the original five-membered ring, are now at positions 3 and 4 on the new six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identity of Compound E.**\n\n*   The Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement of Compound C results in the formation of **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n*   This structure is consistent with the second part of Hint (b). The IR spectrum of Compound E shows a peak at ~1715 cm⁻¹, which is the characteristic C=O stretching frequency for a cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring ketone). The shift from ~1750 cm⁻¹ in Compound A to ~1715 cm⁻¹ in Compound E is strong evidence of the ring expansion from a five-membered to a six-membered ring.\n\nTherefore, Compound E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n<<<D>>>"
