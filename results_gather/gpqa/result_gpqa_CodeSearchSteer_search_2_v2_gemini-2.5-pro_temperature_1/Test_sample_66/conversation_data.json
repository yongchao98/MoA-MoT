    "The initial state of the two-electron system is given by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. In this notation:\n*   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n*   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n*   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   $m = -1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nThe measurement is of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the joint probability of obtaining the eigenvalues of both operators to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a final state where the magnetic quantum numbers for the individual electrons are $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ is a linear superposition of the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$. A fundamental principle of angular momentum coupling is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. That is, for any component in the superposition, the following condition must hold:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nIn this problem, the initial state has a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$. The desired final measurement outcome is for $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the initial state's total z-component of angular momentum:\nSum of the z-components of the desired outcome = $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince the sum of the individual z-components (-2) does not equal the total z-component of the initial state (-1), this particular outcome is physically impossible. The state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator in the z-direction, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The state corresponding to the measurement outcome, $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with an eigenvalue of $(-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n\nBecause these two states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues, they are orthogonal. The probability of measuring the initial state to be in this final state is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product. Since the states are orthogonal, their inner product is zero.\n\nProbability = $|\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2 = 0^2 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>"
