    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the velocity of particle A.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe process is the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into two pairs of particles ($A^+$ and $A^-$).\n\n*   **Initial State:** The total energy at the beginning is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is considered negligible.\n    *   Rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) â‰ˆ 938 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    *   Total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) = $m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n*   **Final State:** The initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four A particles.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$, where $E_A$ is the total energy of a single particle A.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    *   $E_A = \\frac{1876}{4} \\, \\text{MeV} = 469 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy**\n\nThe total energy ($E_A$) of each particle A is the sum of its rest energy ($m_A c^2$) and its kinetic energy. The total energy is also given by the relativistic formula:\n\n*   $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nWe are given that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Velocity**\n\nNow we can find the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.563$\n\nNext, we solve for the velocity, $v$, using the definition of $\\gamma$:\n\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n*   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n*   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n\n*   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}}$\n*   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}}$\n*   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409}$\n*   $v/c = \\sqrt{0.591}$\n*   $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
