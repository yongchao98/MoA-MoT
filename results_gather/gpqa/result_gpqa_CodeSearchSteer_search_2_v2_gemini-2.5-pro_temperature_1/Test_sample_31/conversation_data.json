    "To determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Mass:**\nThe nucleus in question is Lithium with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, which is the isotope Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li). The mass of a Lithium-6 atom is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units (amu). To get the mass of the nucleus, we must subtract the mass of the 3 electrons. However, for energy calculations at this scale, the electron mass is often negligible, and the atomic mass is used as a close approximation for the nuclear mass.\n\nThe mass of a $^{6}$Li atom is more precisely 6.015122887 amu.\n\n**2. Convert Mass to Rest Energy:**\nThe rest energy (E₀) is calculated using Einstein's equation, E = mc². First, we convert the mass from atomic mass units (amu) to Giga-electron-volts (GeV).\n\n*   The conversion factor is 1 amu = 0.9314941 GeV/c².\n*   Rest mass of $^{6}$Li nucleus (m₀): 6.015122887 amu\n*   Rest energy (E₀) = 6.015122887 amu * 0.9314941 GeV/amu\n*   E₀ ≈ 5.60305 GeV\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is a function of the object's speed (v) relative to the speed of light (c).\n\n*   The speed is given as v = 0.96c.\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   v²/c² = (0.96c)² / c² = 0.96² = 0.9216\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784)\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.571428\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E):**\nThe total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n\n*   The formula for total energy is: E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.571428 * 5.60305 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.01089 GeV\n\nRounding this value to a precision of 1e-4 gives 20.0109 GeV. Looking at the options provided, the closest value is 20.132 GeV. The minor discrepancy can arise from using slightly different values for the mass of Lithium-6 or the conversion factor.\n\nLet's re-calculate using the precise mass of a proton and neutron to build the nucleus, accounting for binding energy.\n*   Mass of proton ≈ 938.272 MeV/c² = 0.938272 GeV/c²\n*   Mass of neutron ≈ 939.565 MeV/c² = 0.939565 GeV/c²\n*   Total mass of 3 protons and 3 neutrons = 3 * (0.938272 + 0.939565) GeV/c² = 5.633511 GeV/c²\n*   The binding energy of Lithium-6 is about 31.99 MeV, which is 0.03199 GeV.\n*   Rest energy of the nucleus = (Mass of constituents) - (Binding energy) = 5.633511 GeV - 0.03199 GeV = 5.601521 GeV\n*   Total energy E = γ * E₀ = 3.571428 * 5.601521 GeV ≈ 20.0054 GeV\n\nBoth calculations yield a result very close to 20.01 GeV. The closest answer choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
