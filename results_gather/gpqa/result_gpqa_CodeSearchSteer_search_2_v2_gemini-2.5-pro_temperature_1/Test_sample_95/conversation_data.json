    "To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we can follow a two-step process. First, we calculate the size of the black hole's event horizon using its angular size and distance. Second, we use this size to find the entropy with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Event Horizon Radius\n\nThe relationship between an object's physical size, its angular size, and its distance can be approximated for small angles. The diameter of the event horizon (which is twice the Schwarzschild radius, R_s) can be found using the given angular size (θ) and the distance (d).\n\n1.  **Convert the given values to standard units:**\n    *   The distance `d` is 10¹⁰ parsecs. One parsec is approximately 3.086 x 10¹⁶ meters.\n        `d = 10¹⁰ pc * (3.086 x 10¹⁶ m/pc) = 3.086 x 10²⁶ m`\n    *   The angular size `θ` is 10⁻¹⁷ degrees. To use it in the formula, we need to convert it to radians (1 degree = π/180 radians).\n        `θ_rad = 10⁻¹⁷ deg * (π / 180) ≈ 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ radians`\n\n2.  **Calculate the diameter and radius of the event horizon:**\n    *   The diameter `D` is given by `D = d * θ_rad`.\n        `D = (3.086 x 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ rad) ≈ 5.385 x 10⁷ m`\n    *   The Schwarzschild radius `R_s` is half of the diameter.\n        `R_s = D / 2 ≈ 2.693 x 10⁷ m`\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Entropy\n\nThe entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, which relates the entropy (S) to the area of the event horizon (A).\n\n1.  **Calculate the area of the event horizon (A):**\n    *   The area of a sphere is `A = 4 * π * R_s²`.\n        `A = 4 * π * (2.693 x 10⁷ m)² ≈ 9.11 x 10¹⁵ m²`\n\n2.  **Calculate the entropy (S):**\n    *   The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is `S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_P²)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and `l_P` is the Planck length.\n    *   The values of the constants are:\n        *   `k_B ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`\n        *   `l_P ≈ 1.616 x 10⁻³⁵ m`\n    *   Now, we substitute the values into the entropy formula:\n        `S ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K * 9.11 x 10¹⁵ m²) / (4 * (1.616 x 10⁻³⁵ m)²)`\n        `S ≈ (1.257 x 10⁻⁷ J/K·m²) / (4 * 2.611 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m²)`\n        `S ≈ (1.257 x 10⁻⁷ J/K·m²) / (1.0444 x 10⁻⁶⁹ m²)`\n        `S ≈ 1.2 x 10⁶² J/K`\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 1.2 x 10⁶² J/K. This corresponds to an order of magnitude of 10⁶² J/K.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 10⁶⁵ J/K\nB) 10⁶² J/K\nC) 10⁶⁶ J/K\nD) 10⁵⁹ J/K\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
