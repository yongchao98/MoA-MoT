    "The multi-step synthesis proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n    Benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The reaction introduces a nitro group (-NO₂) onto the benzene ring to form nitrobenzene (Product 1).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\n    Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron powder. The iron acts as a catalyst (forming FeBr₃ in situ) for this electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The nitro group is a deactivating and meta-directing group. Therefore, the bromine atom is added to the position meta (position 3) to the nitro group, yielding 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (Product 2).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\n    Product 2 (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene) is stirred with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction that selectively reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH₂). The bromo-group is typically unaffected by these conditions. The resulting product is 3-bromoaniline (Product 3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Diazotization of the Amine**\n    Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and fluoroboric acid (HBF₄). This reaction converts the primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The product is 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (Product 4).\n\n5.  **Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction**\n    Product 4 (3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate) is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). This is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, where the diazonium salt forms a 3-bromophenyl radical. This radical then attacks the anisole ring. The methoxy group (-OCH₃) on anisole is an activating, ortho, para-directing group. Due to sterics, the incoming group preferentially adds to the para-position (position 4). The coupling of the 3-bromophenyl group to the para-position of anisole results in the final product, 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl (Product 5).\n\nBased on this five-step synthesis, the correct final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n<<<B>>>"
