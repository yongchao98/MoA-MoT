    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂** within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\nThe vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction and r is the distance from the origin. The field's magnitude is 1/r², and it points radially outward.\n\n**2. Calculate the Divergence**\nThe divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is given by the formula:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² fₙ)/∂r + ... (terms for θ and φ components)\n\nSince the field **f** only has a radial component, fᵣ = 1/r², and the other components are zero, the formula simplifies to:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r\n∇ ⋅ **f** = 0\n\nThis calculation holds for any point where r ≠ 0.\n\n**3. The Singularity at the Origin**\nAt the origin (r = 0), the vector field **f** is undefined, creating a singularity. A naive conclusion would be that since the divergence is zero everywhere, its volume integral must also be zero. However, the singularity at the origin, which is included in the volume of integration, requires more careful treatment.\n\n**4. Applying the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\nThe Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V to the surface integral of the field's flux through the closed surface S that encloses the volume.\n∫∫∫ₙ(∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nEven though the divergence is zero almost everywhere, the theorem allows us to find the value of the integral by calculating the flux through the surface of the sphere. This approach correctly handles the effect of the singularity.\n\n**5. Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n*   The surface S is a sphere of radius R.\n*   The vector field on this surface is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n*   The differential surface area element d**S** for a sphere is also in the radial direction: d**S** = **r̂** dS = **r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n*   The dot product **f** ⋅ d**S** is:\n    (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = (1/R² **r̂**) ⋅ (**r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ) = sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n*   Now, we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere:\n    Flux = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ\n*   First, integrate with respect to θ:\n    ∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2.\n*   Next, integrate with respect to φ:\n    ∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = 2 [φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2(2π) = 4π.\n\nThe result of the surface integral is 4π. According to the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the volume integral of the divergence. The non-zero result indicates that the singularity at the origin acts as a source. In physics, this field is analogous to the electric field of a point charge, and the integral represents Gauss's Law. The divergence of this field is more formally described by the Dirac delta function, specifically 4πδ³(**r**).\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence is therefore 4π.\n\n<<<D>>>"
