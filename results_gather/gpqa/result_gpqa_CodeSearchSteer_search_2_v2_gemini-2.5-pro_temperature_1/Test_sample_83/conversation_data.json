    "The key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, in the context of solving higher-dimensional heat equations with the described numerical method, is the use of partial fraction decomposition.\n\nWhen the matrix exponential function `exp(lA)` is approximated by a rational function, for example, `r(lA) = q(lA)⁻¹p(lA)`, the calculation of the term `q(lA)⁻¹` can lead to a sequential process. This often involves factoring the denominator polynomial `q(z)` and then solving a sequence of linear systems one after the other.\n\nTo transform this into a parallel process, the rational approximation is expanded using partial fractions. This decomposition breaks the single complex fraction into a sum of simpler fractions. This allows a large, sequential problem to be reformulated as a series of smaller, independent linear systems. Each of these independent systems can then be solved simultaneously on a different processor. This method of using partial fraction decomposition is key to achieving parallelism.\n\nTherefore, the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation is the crucial element that enables the conversion of the algorithm from sequential to parallel.\n\n<<<A>>>"
