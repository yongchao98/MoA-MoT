    "This problem describes a classic case of Larmor precession. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, S_z. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the y-direction, the spin begins to precess around the new axis of the magnetic field.\n\nThe Hamiltonian of the system in the presence of a magnetic field **B** is given by H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**, where **μ** is the magnetic moment. Since **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ**S** ⋅ **B**.\n\nWith the new magnetic field **B** = B**ŷ**, the Hamiltonian is H = -γB S_y. The time evolution of the expectation value of any operator that does not explicitly depend on time is governed by the Heisenberg equation of motion. For the z-component of the spin, ⟨S_z⟩, its expectation value will oscillate.\n\nThe frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, which is given by ω = γB (in angular frequency units). The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, ⟨S_z(t)⟩, and consequently the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩, will oscillate with this frequency.\n\nThe detailed calculation shows that the expectation value of the z-component of the spin is ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt). The argument of the cosine function is ωt, which means the angular frequency of oscillation is ω = γB.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>"
