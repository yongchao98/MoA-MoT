    "The search results confirm the physics principles I used. Specifically, they confirm that for a spectroscopic binary, the masses, period, and velocities are related through Kepler's third law. Several sources mention that if you can measure the radial velocities of both stars (a double-lined spectroscopic binary), you can determine the mass ratio.\n\nThe key relationship for the total mass (M1 + M2) is derived from Kepler's third law. As stated in one of the sources, \"(mass 1 + mass 2) = (separation distance)³/(orbital period)²\". The separation distance can be related to the observed velocities and the period.\n\nCrucially, the observed radial velocity depends on the inclination angle 'i' of the orbit to our line of sight (radial velocity = true velocity × sin(i)). However, for an eclipsing binary, we know the system is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle is close to 90 degrees, and sin(i) is approximately 1. This justifies the assumption made in my derivation.\n\nThe formula I derived, M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³, is consistent with these principles. The search did not provide this exact final formula in one place, but the components of the derivation are all supported by the search results.\n\nI am confident in my initial calculation. The steps are logical and the underlying physics is sound and confirmed by the search.\n\n**Calculation Recap:**\n1.  **Formula:** The total mass (M) of a double-lined spectroscopic, eclipsing binary system is proportional to its period (P) and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum).\n    *   M ∝ P * (K_sum)³\n\n2.  **System 1:**\n    *   P₁ = 2 years\n    *   K_sum₁ = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   M₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n3.  **System 2:**\n    *   P₂ = 1 year\n    *   K_sum₂ = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   M₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n4.  **Ratio M₁ / M₂:**\n    *   Ratio = 6750 / 15625\n    *   Ratio = (2 * 15³) / (1 * 25³)\n    *   Ratio = 2 * (15/25)³\n    *   Ratio = 2 * (3/5)³\n    *   Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    *   Ratio = 54 / 125 = 0.432\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is 0.432, which is closest to option D.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\". This means calculating the ratio M1 / M2. My calculation does exactly that. The result is less than 1, meaning system 1 is less massive than system 2. The wording \"more massive\" might be slightly confusing, but the factor is the numerical result of the ratio.\n\nThe calculation is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
