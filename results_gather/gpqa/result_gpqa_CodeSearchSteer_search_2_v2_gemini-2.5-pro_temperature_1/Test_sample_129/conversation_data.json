    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of an object so that its Lyman-alpha absorption can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the atmospheric cutoff. The Earth's atmosphere blocks most ultraviolet (UV) radiation, allowing optical observations from the ground only for wavelengths longer than a certain limit.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the estimation:\n\n*   **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) Wavelength:** The Lyα transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers. This wavelength falls within the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n*   **Atmospheric Cutoff:** Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most light with wavelengths shorter than about 3200-3500 Å. Observations below this limit require space-based telescopes.\n*   **Redshift Calculation:** The cosmological redshift (z) stretches the wavelength of light. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the rest wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula:  \n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z).\n\nTo detect the Lyα line from the ground, its wavelength must be redshifted to be longer than the atmospheric cutoff. We can calculate the minimum redshift required by setting the observed wavelength to a practical cutoff limit, for example, 3500 Å.\n\nUsing the formula:  \nz = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1  \nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1  \nz ≈ 2.88 - 1  \nz ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculation shows that the redshift must be approximately 1.9 or greater. Let's check the observed wavelength for the options provided:\n\n*   **For z = 1.9:** λ_obs = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 Å. This is above the atmospheric cutoff and detectable.\n*   **For z = 1.2:** λ_obs = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.2) = 2675.2 Å. This is well into the UV range and would be completely blocked by the atmosphere.\n\nTherefore, a redshift of at least ~1.9 is required to shift the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line into the visible part of the spectrum observable by ground-based telescopes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
