    "Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space, resulting in non-superimposable mirror images. This property is typically observed in molecules that are chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and ester groups) at all four ortho-positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, eliminates the plane of symmetry that would otherwise make the molecule superimposable on its mirror image. Consequently, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule possesses a chiral center. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a stereocenter, rendering the molecule chiral and capable of existing as two enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The benzophenone molecule consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group in the solid state, in solution, there is free rotation around the single bonds. The molecule possesses a C2 axis of symmetry and can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar with respect to the carbon-carbon double bond and possesses a center of symmetry as well as a plane of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
