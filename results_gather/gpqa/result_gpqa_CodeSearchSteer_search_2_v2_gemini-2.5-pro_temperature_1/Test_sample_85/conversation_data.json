    "The analysis of the search results confirms the initial reasoning.\n\n*   **Selectivity of BH3:** Borane (BH3) selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. This is a well-established principle in organic chemistry. The reaction proceeds through an acyloxyborane intermediate which is then further reduced.\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH4:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. While less common than NaBH4 or LiAlH4, its specific niche is this selective reduction of esters.\n*   **Reaction Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the carbonyl groups by these hydride reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) and the subsequent intramolecular cyclization (lactonization or transesterification) do not affect the configuration of the existing chiral center at C3 of the starting material's carbon chain.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly dictates the stereochemistry of the lactone product in both reactions.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n**Reaction A:**\n1.  **Reagent:** LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)\n2.  **Starting Material A:** (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n3.  **Action of LiBH4:** Selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact.\n    `A --(LiBH4)--> (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid + isobutanol`\n4.  **Cyclization:** The resulting hydroxy-acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) upon workup (H+).\n    `(R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid --(H+)--> (R/S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The stereocenter is retained throughout the process. Since the product is **(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, the starting material A must have been **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n1.  **Reagent:** BH3 (Borane)\n2.  **Starting Material B:** (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n3.  **Action of BH3:** Selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n    `B --(BH3)--> Isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`\n4.  **Cyclization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification upon workup (H+).\n    `Isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate --(H+)--> (R/S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one + isobutanol`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The stereocenter is also retained in this reaction sequence. Since the product is **(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, the starting material B must have been **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nCombining these findings:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
