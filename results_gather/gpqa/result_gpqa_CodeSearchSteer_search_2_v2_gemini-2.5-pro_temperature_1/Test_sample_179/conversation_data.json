    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the minimum energy of the system:\n\n### 1. Define the System and Energy Components\n\nThe system consists of 13 identical particles, each with a charge `q = 2e`.\n*   One particle is fixed at a central point P.\n*   The other 12 particles are constrained to a spherical surface of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy (`U_total`) of this system is the sum of two parts:\n1.  **`U_center_sphere`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **`U_sphere_sphere`**: The potential energy from the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nThe formula for the potential energy between two point charges `q1` and `q2` separated by a distance `r` is `U = k * (q1 * q2) / r`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Center-Sphere Interaction Energy (`U_center_sphere`)\n\nEach of the 12 charges (`q = 2e`) on the sphere is at a distance `R = 2 m` from the central charge (`q = 2e`).\nThe energy for one such pair is `k * q^2 / R`.\nSince there are 12 such pairs, the total energy for this component is:\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * q^2 / R) = 12 * (k * (2e)^2 / R) = 12 * (4 * k * e^2 / R) = 48 * k * e^2 / R`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Sphere-Sphere Interaction Energy (`U_sphere_sphere`)\n\nTo find the minimum energy for the 12 charges on the sphere, they will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. This is a well-known problem in physics called the **Thomson problem**. For 12 charges, the configuration of minimum energy is at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe total energy of this configuration is the sum of the potential energies for all unique pairs of charges.\n`U_sphere_sphere = Σ (k * q^2 / r_ij)` for all 66 pairs (i, j).\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n`U_sphere_sphere = (k * q^2 / R) * E_12`\nwhere `E_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the geometric arrangement for the N=12 Thomson problem. The value for the icosahedral configuration is `E_12 ≈ 49.165482`.\n\nSubstituting `q = 2e`:\n`U_sphere_sphere = (k * (2e)^2 / R) * E_12 = (4 * k * e^2 / R) * E_12`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Energy\n\nNow, we sum the two energy components:\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n`U_total = (48 * k * e^2 / R) + (4 * k * e^2 / R) * E_12`\n`U_total = (4 * k * e^2 / R) * (12 + E_12)`\n\n### 5. Plug in the Constants and Calculate\n\nWe use the following standard values for the physical constants:\n*   **Coulomb's constant (k):** `8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`\n*   **Elementary charge (e):** `1.602176634 × 10^-19 C`\n*   A useful combined constant is `k * e^2 ≈ 2.3070775 × 10^-28 J⋅m`.\n*   **Radius (R):** `2 m`\n*   **Thomson energy (E_12):** `49.165482`\n\nNow, substitute these values into the total energy equation:\n\n`U_total = (4 * (2.3070775 × 10^-28 J⋅m) / 2 m) * (12 + 49.165482)`\n`U_total = (2 * 2.3070775 × 10^-28 J) * (61.165482)`\n`U_total = (4.614155 × 10^-28 J) * (61.165482)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82237 × 10^-26 J`\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy is `2.822 × 10^-26 J`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
