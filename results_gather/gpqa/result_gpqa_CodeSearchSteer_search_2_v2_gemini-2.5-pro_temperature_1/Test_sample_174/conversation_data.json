    "An oscillating charge distribution, regardless of its specific shape, will radiate electromagnetic waves. For a distribution with a size much smaller than the radiated wavelength λ, the dominant form of radiation is electric dipole radiation. An oscillating spheroid with the symmetry axis along the z-axis, where charge oscillates along this axis, can be modeled as a simple oscillating electric dipole.\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) from an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n\ndP/dΩ ∝ (ω⁴/r²) * sin²(θ)\n\nwhere:\n*   ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   r is the distance from the source (in the radiation zone).\n*   θ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nThe formula shows two key dependencies:\n1.  **Angular Dependence**: The radiated power is proportional to sin²(θ). The maximum power, A, is radiated at θ = 90° (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis), because sin²(90°) = 1. The power at any other angle is a fraction of this maximum. For θ = 30°, the fraction is sin²(30°). Since sin(30°) = 1/2, the fraction is (1/2)² = 1/4.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence**: The radiated power is proportional to ω⁴. Since the angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by ω = 2πc/λ (where c is the speed of light), the power is proportional to (1/λ)⁴, or λ⁻⁴. This λ⁻⁴ dependence is a characteristic feature of electric dipole radiation, also known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at an angle θ = 30⁰ is 1/4, and a possible form of the function f, which describes the power dependence on wavelength, is proportional to λ⁻⁴.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
