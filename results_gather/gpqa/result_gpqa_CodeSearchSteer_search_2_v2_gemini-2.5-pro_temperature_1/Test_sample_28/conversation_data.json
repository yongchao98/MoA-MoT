    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to inactivate the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that results in a non-functional or severely truncated protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein sequence, keeping in mind that protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` codon and terminates at a stop codon.\n\n*   **Intact gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...TGA-3’`\n    *   This sequence translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...TGA-3’`\n    *   The mutation changes the third codon from `CTC` to `TAC`.\n    *   `CTC` codes for the amino acid Leucine.\n    *   `TAC` codes for the amino acid Tyrosine.\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**: it changes one amino acid for another. This might or might not inactivate the protein, depending on the importance of this specific amino acid to the protein's structure and function. It is not a guaranteed method of elimination.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTT TAA GCT GGT...TGA-3’`\n    *   The mutation changes the third codon from `CTC` to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with `TGA` and `TAG`).\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**: it introduces a premature stop codon. The translation of the protein will halt at this point, resulting in a very short, truncated protein containing only two amino acids (Met-Phe). This truncated protein is almost certain to be non-functional, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...TGA-3’`\n    *   This mutant sequence contains multiple changes compared to the intact gene.\n    *   The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   The sixth codon changes from `ACT` (Threonine) to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   The seventh codon changes from `TCT` (Serine) to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   These are all **missense mutations**, changing three different amino acids in the protein chain. While multiple changes increase the likelihood of disrupting protein function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon. The full-length protein will be produced, and it might retain some or all of its function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact sequence reveals two changes: the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the fifth codon, `GGT` (Glycine), has been deleted entirely.\n    *   This results in a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of a full three-nucleotide codon). The reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved. The final protein will have one amino acid changed and be one amino acid shorter. This could disrupt the protein's function, but like missense mutations, it is not a guaranteed loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most reliable way to eliminate the function of the gene is to introduce a premature stop codon, which is what occurs in Mutant 2. This nonsense mutation will cause protein synthesis to terminate almost immediately, ensuring the production of the anti-nutritional compound is stopped.\n\n<<<D>>>"
