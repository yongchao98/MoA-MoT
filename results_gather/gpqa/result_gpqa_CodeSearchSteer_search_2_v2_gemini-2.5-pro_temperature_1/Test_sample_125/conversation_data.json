    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting products to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone, meaning it is a single enantiomer. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3, which is a prochiral center, creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group. This results in the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because one stereocenter (C5) is the same in both molecules, while the other stereocenter (C3) is different.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), a reducing agent that converts ketones to alcohols, followed by an acidic workup. Both ketone groups will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol, which has two stereocenters (at C2 and C4). This reaction produces three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (this is a meso compound, as it has a plane of symmetry, and is identical to the (2S, 4R) form).\n*   **Relationship:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. The meso isomer is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Products by HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are indistinguishable in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different physical properties, so it will be separated, resulting in a **second peak** from Reaction II's products.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are structurally different molecules and will not co-elute.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated from each other:\n    *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer to the other two, will elute separately, giving a **third peak**.\n*   Again, it is assumed that none of the five distinct compounds accidentally co-elute.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
