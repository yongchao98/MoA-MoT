    "To find the energy spectrum for the given potential, we first analyze the potential `V(r, θ)`. It is beneficial to convert the potential from polar coordinates (r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\nThe relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n`x = r cos(θ)`\n`y = r sin(θ)`\n`r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nThe potential is given by:\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nSubstituting the Cartesian equivalents:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)`\n\nDistributing the terms, we get:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2`\n\nCombining the terms with `x^2`:\n`V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThis potential is in the form of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. It is separable into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction:\n`V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`\nwhere `V_x(x) = 1/2 (4k)x^2` and `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for this system is separable, and the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the two independent oscillators, `E = E_x + E_y`.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential `V(z) = 1/2 k_z z^2` are given by the formula `E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `sqrt(k_z/m)`.\n\nFor the x-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is `k_x = 4k`.\nThe angular frequency is `ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)`.\nThe energy is `E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)`.\n\nFor the y-direction:\nThe spring constant is `k_y = k`.\nThe angular frequency is `ω_y = sqrt(k/m)`.\nThe energy is `E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`.\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of `E_{n_x}` and `E_{n_y}`:\n`E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} = (n_x + 1/2) * 2ℏ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nNow, we can factor out `ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`:\n`E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
