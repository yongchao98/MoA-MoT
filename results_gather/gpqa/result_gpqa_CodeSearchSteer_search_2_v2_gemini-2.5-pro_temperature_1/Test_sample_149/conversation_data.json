    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting (t) indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to a -CH₂- group. The doublet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which is the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, the starting material is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The NMR data aligns perfectly with this structure: the amine and the acetaldehyde group are para to each other on the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    *   This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   The intermediate formed is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt and typically warming the mixture results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   This step produces **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, which are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation. An aldol condensation is a two-part reaction: an aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from the -CH₂- group of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the aldehyde carbon of a second molecule. This initially forms an aldol addition product, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on carbon 3 and the acidic proton on carbon 2 are removed, forming a double bond. This results in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation reaction. Given the application of heat in the final step, the reaction proceeds to completion to form the dehydrated condensation product, not just the initial addition product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
