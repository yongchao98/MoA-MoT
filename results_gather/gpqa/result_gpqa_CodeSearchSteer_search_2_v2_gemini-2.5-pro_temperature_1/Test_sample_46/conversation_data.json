    "Based on a thorough analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Here is a detailed breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion.\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A calculation reveals 5 degrees of unsaturation. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically in the range expected for an ester. The value is too high for an amide and fits well for an aromatic ester.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl (-CH3) group that is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2) group, which splits it into a triplet. This is the \"ethyl\" part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H):** This signal is from a methylene (-CH2) group adjacent to a methyl (-CH3) group, resulting in a quartet. Its significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates it is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of the ester group (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to chemical exchange and nitrogen's quadrupolar effects.\n*   **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two doublets, each integrating to two protons, arise from the symmetry of the ring. The protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group are shifted upfield (around 7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group are shifted significantly downfield (around 8.0 ppm).\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- next to the carbonyl group at a much lower chemical shift (~2.3-2.6 ppm).\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show a single N-H band in the IR spectrum and a 1H signal for the amide proton in the NMR, not the two bands and 2H signal for a primary amine.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. All spectroscopic data perfectly match this structure, also known as Benzocaine. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring, consistent with all IR and NMR signals.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. The C=O stretch for an amide is typically at a lower frequency (~1650-1680 cm⁻¹). Also, a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) ring would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
