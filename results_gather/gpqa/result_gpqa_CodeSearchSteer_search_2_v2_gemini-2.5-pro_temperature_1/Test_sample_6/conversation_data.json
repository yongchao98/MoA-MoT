    "The calculation performed in the thought process is sound and confirmed by the principles of particle physics. The key steps are:\n1.  Identify the physical process: a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) collides with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$).\n2.  Determine the condition for the reaction to occur. This is a threshold energy problem. The reaction is possible only if the center-of-mass energy of the two photons is at least the rest mass energy of the products, which are an electron and a positron. The combined rest mass energy of an electron-positron pair is $2 \\times m_e c^2$.\n3.  Set up the calculation for the threshold energy. The threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray depends on the collision angle. The minimum threshold energy occurs in a head-on collision.\n4.  Derive the formula for the minimum threshold energy ($E_\\gamma$) of the high-energy photon, which is $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$, where $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of the electron and $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon.\n5.  Use the given and known physical constants to calculate the value.\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) is approximately 0.511 MeV.\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$) is given in the problem as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n6.  Perform the calculation:\n    *   Convert all energy units to a consistent unit, like electron-volts (eV).\n        *   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n        *   $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Substitute the values into the formula:\n        $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Convert the final result to Giga-electron-volts (GeV) as required by the options.\n        *   $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n        *   $E_\\gamma = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThis result, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$, corresponds to option D. This is the energy threshold above which high-energy gamma rays will have their lifetime significantly limited due to pair production with CMB photons, creating a \"horizon\" for their propagation through the universe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
