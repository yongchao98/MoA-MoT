    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the thermal decomposition.**\n\nThe gaseous mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes, allowing us to identify the components and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no acidic gases like CO₂ or NO₂ were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and reacts with oxidizing gases like oxygen (O₂) or nitrogen oxides (e.g., N₂O, NO). The reaction forms copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that combined with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the previous reagents, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g) by the law of conservation of mass. We can find the mass of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from reaction with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as no other elements are indicated.\n    *   Mass of N = Total mass - Mass of H - Mass of O = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.01 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n**3. Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states that A and B are salts and form an equimolar mixture. Since the elements are N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. A salt consists of a cation and an anion.\n\n*   The cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺).\n*   Let's check if the salts each contain one ammonium ion. An equimolar mixture of NH₄⁺A⁻ and NH₄⁺B⁻ would have a combined formula of N₂H₈(A'B').\n*   Our elemental mole ratio for the entire mixture is H:N:O = 0.40:0.20:0.25. To get integers, we multiply by 20, which gives H₈N₄O₅.\n*   The formula for the combined pair of salt molecules (A+B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n*   If we assume both salts have one NH₄⁺ cation, we use N₂H₈ for the cations. The remaining atoms for the two anions are N₂O₅.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-based anions. The logical choices are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Anion 1: NO₂⁻ (uses 1 N, 2 O)\n    *   Anion 2: NO₃⁻ (uses 1 N, 3 O)\n    *   Total atoms used in anions: 2 N, 5 O. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Verify with the decomposition reactions.**\n\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts matches the observed products. The standard thermal decompositions are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar, let's say we have `n` moles of each. The overall reaction is:\n`n`NH₄NO₂ + `n`NH₄NO₃ → `n`N₂ + `n`N₂O + 4`n`H₂O\n\nFrom our analysis, we found 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n*   4`n` = 0.20 mol ⇒ `n` = 0.05 mol.\n\nThis means the decomposition produced:\n*   `n` = 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   `n` = 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n*   4`n` = 0.20 mol of H₂O (which is 3.6 g).\n\nNow let's trace the gases through the tubes:\n*   The N₂O gas (0.05 mol) reacts with the hot copper. It contains 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms (mass = 0.05 * 16 = 0.80 g), matching the mass gain of tube №3. The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This produces another 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final gas C is the sum of the original N₂ and the N₂ produced from N₂O: 0.05 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.10 mol N₂. This matches the 2.24 L of remaining gas.\n*   Let's check the initial mass:\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ (molar mass ≈ 64 g/mol) = 0.05 × 64 = 3.20 g.\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (molar mass ≈ 80 g/mol) = 0.05 × 80 = 4.00 g.\n    *   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given total weight.\n\nThe identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
