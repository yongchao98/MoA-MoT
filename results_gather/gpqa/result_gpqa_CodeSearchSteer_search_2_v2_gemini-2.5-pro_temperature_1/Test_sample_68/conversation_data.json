    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required minimum resolution.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$)**: This is the average lifetime of the particle $X^0$ in its own rest frame, given as $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   **Time Dilation**: Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the bubble chamber (the lab frame), its lifetime will appear longer to an observer in the lab. This observed lifetime ($\\tau$) is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: This factor depends on the particle's energy (E) and rest mass ($m_0$). It's calculated as $\\gamma = E / (m_0c^2)$. In particle physics, energy and mass are often given in units of GeV and GeV/cÂ², respectively, which simplifies the calculation to $\\gamma = E / m_0$.\n*   **Mean Decay Length (d)**: This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It's calculated as $d = v \\times \\tau$, where v is the particle's velocity. A more direct formula is $d = \\frac{p}{m_0}c\\tau_0$, where p is the particle's momentum.\n*   **Decay Probability**: The decay of particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` *before* decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/d}$.\n\n### 2. Interpreting the Question\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\" In experimental particle physics, a decay is considered \"observed\" or \"resolved\" if the decay vertex is distinguishible from the production vertex. This means the particle must travel a certain minimum distance, `L` (the resolution of the detector), before it decays.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for the distance `L` such that the probability of the particle traveling *more* than `L` is at least 30%.\n\n$P(\\text{distance} > L) \\ge 0.30$\n\nUsing the exponential decay law, this probability is:\n\n$e^{-L/d} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution (which in this context means the largest possible value of `L` that satisfies the condition), we solve for the equality:\n\n$e^{-L/d} = 0.30$\n$L = -d \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the momentum ($pc$) of the particle.**\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass ($m_0$) is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\n$(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 = (pc)^2 + (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n$729 = (pc)^2 + 11.6281$\n$(pc)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($d$) in the lab frame.**\nThe formula for the mean decay length is $d = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$.\n*   $pc = 26.78$ GeV\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n$d = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$d \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m})$\n$d \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the required resolution ($L$).**\n$L = -d \\times \\ln(0.30)$\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$L \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n$L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value for the minimum resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\nThe value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (around 9%) is likely due to rounding of the initial values provided in the problem statement. Option B is the only one with the correct order of magnitude.\n\n<<<B>>>"
