    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we will analyze the given Lagrangian term using dimensional analysis in a 4-dimensional spacetime.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Lagrangian\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action `S` is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over 4-dimensional spacetime: `S = ∫d⁴x L`.\n*   The mass dimension of the spacetime differential `d⁴x` is `[d⁴x] = M⁻⁴`.\n*   For the action `S` to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of `[L] = M⁴`.\n\nNow, let's determine the mass dimensions of the individual components in the interaction Lagrangian `L_int`:\n\n*   **Fermion Field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion field in the Dirac Lagrangian is `ψ-bar(iγ^μ∂_μ)ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing that the derivative `∂_μ` has a mass dimension of 1, we get `[ψ] + [ψ] + 1 = 4`. This implies that `2[ψ] = 3`, so the mass dimension of the fermion field is `[ψ] = M³/²`.\n*   **Field Strength Tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `-1/4 * F_μν * F^μν`. For this to have a mass dimension of 4, we require `2[F^μν] = 4`, which means the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is `[F^μν] = M²`.\n*   **Sigma Tensor (σ_μν):** The term `σ_μν` is defined as `(i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. The gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless, `[σ_μν] = M⁰`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Mass Dimension of κ\n\nNow we can use the interaction Lagrangian `L_int = κ * ψ-bar * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν` to find the mass dimension of κ.\n\nWe equate the mass dimension of the entire term to 4:\n`[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ-bar] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F^μν] = 4`\n\nSubstituting the known mass dimensions:\n`[κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 5 = 4`\n`[κ] = -1`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 3. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining if a theory is renormalizable is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If all coupling constants have a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero (`[g] ≥ 0`), the theory is generally renormalizable (or super-renormalizable if `[g] > 0`).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension (`[g] < 0`), the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nIn this case, the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ is -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is non-renormalizable. Such an interaction term is considered a higher-dimension operator. While useful in effective field theories, it leads to infinities in calculations at high energies that cannot be removed by redefining a finite number of parameters.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
