    "The user's question requires a detailed understanding of the solar neutrino energy spectrum. I have performed a search and found several resources, including graphs and descriptions of the neutrino fluxes from the different reaction chains in the Sun.\n\nHere is a summary of the relevant information:\n*   **pp-I chain:** Produces low-energy 'pp' neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 0.42 MeV (420 keV). These are outside the energy bands of interest (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV).\n*   **pp-II chain:** Produces monoenergetic '7Be' neutrinos. The vast majority (90%) have an energy of 0.861 MeV (861 keV). This energy falls squarely into **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**. The other 10% have an energy of 0.383 MeV, which is outside both bands.\n*   **pp-III chain:** Produces '8B' neutrinos, which have a continuous and broad energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV. These neutrinos contribute to the flux in **both Band 1 (700-800 keV) and Band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n*   **CNO cycle:** Produces neutrinos from the decay of 13N and 15O, with continuous spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. These also contribute to **both Band 1 and Band 2**. However, the CNO cycle is a minor contributor to the Sun's energy (about 1%), and its neutrino flux is significantly lower than the pp chain fluxes.\n\n**The Hypothetical Scenario:**\nThe pp-III branch suddenly stops. This means the production of **8B neutrinos ceases immediately**. All other reactions, including the pp-II chain and the CNO cycle, continue as they were.\n\nLet's analyze the composition of the neutrino flux in each band *after* the pp-III branch has stopped:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The contribution from 8B neutrinos disappears.\n    *   What remains is the contribution from the CNO cycle neutrinos. Looking at solar neutrino spectrum graphs, the flux from CNO neutrinos in this region is very small, almost negligible compared to the other components.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The contribution from 8B neutrinos disappears.\n    *   The very strong, monoenergetic line from the **7Be neutrinos at 861 keV** remains. This line is the dominant feature in this energy band.\n    *   The small contribution from CNO cycle neutrinos also remains.\n\n**Calculating the Ratio:**\n\n*   **Flux (band 1)** = Flux from CNO neutrinos (700-800 keV)\n*   **Flux (band 2)** = Flux from 7Be neutrinos (at 861 keV) + Flux from CNO neutrinos (800-900 keV)\n\nBy inspecting solar neutrino spectra plots, it is visually clear that the flux from the 7Be line is vastly greater than the continuous CNO spectrum flux in the adjacent 700-800 keV band. The CNO flux is generally orders of magnitude lower than the main pp-chain fluxes.\n\nAfter the pp-III (8B) neutrinos are removed, Band 2 is completely dominated by the prominent 7Be line at 861 keV. Band 1, on the other hand, contains only the very low, almost baseline-level flux from the tail of the CNO spectra.\n\nTherefore, the flux in Band 2 will be significantly larger than the flux in Band 1. The ratio Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2) will be a very small number.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA) 1: Incorrect. The fluxes are not equal.\nB) 10: Incorrect. This would mean Band 1 flux is much larger than Band 2.\nC) 0.01 (10^-2): This represents a small ratio where Flux(band 2) is about 100 times larger than Flux(band 1).\nD) 0.1 (10^-1): This represents a ratio where Flux(band 2) is 10 times larger than Flux(band 1).\n\nGiven that the 7Be line is a major component of the total solar neutrino flux (second only to the pp neutrinos themselves) and the CNO flux is a minor component overall (about 1% of the sun's energy production), the flux from the 7Be line will be dramatically higher than the CNO flux in the 700-800 keV range. A ratio of 0.01 is a very plausible approximation for (very small CNO flux) / (large 7Be flux). The difference in their respective total fluxes is about two orders of magnitude. It is reasonable to assume this difference holds for these specific energy bands.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Flux(band 1) after stop ≈ CNO flux contribution.\n*   Flux(band 2) after stop ≈ 7Be line flux + CNO flux contribution.\n*   Since 7Be flux >> CNO flux, Flux(band 2) ≈ 7Be flux.\n*   The ratio is approximately (CNO flux in band 1) / (7Be flux in band 2).\n*   Total CNO neutrino flux is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the total 7Be flux. This makes a ratio of ~0.01 highly likely.\n\nThus, the approximate ratio of Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2) is 0.01.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.### Analysis of the Solar Neutrino Flux\n\nTo determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes in the specified energy bands under the hypothetical scenario, we must first understand the sources of solar neutrinos in each band.\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV or 0.7-0.8 MeV):** Under normal conditions, neutrinos in this energy range originate from two main sources:\n    *   The **pp-III branch**, which produces Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum extending up to ~15 MeV.\n    *   The **CNO cycle**, which produces neutrinos from the decays of Nitrogen-13 (¹³N) and Oxygen-15 (¹⁵O) with continuous spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively.\n\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV or 0.8-0.9 MeV):** Neutrinos in this band come from:\n    *   The **pp-II branch**, which is the source of mono-energetic Beryllium-7 (⁷Be) neutrinos. The vast majority (about 90%) of these have a distinct energy of 861 keV (0.861 MeV), placing them squarely in this band.\n    *   The **pp-III branch** (⁸B neutrinos), which also contributes to this energy range.\n    *   The **CNO cycle** (¹³N and ¹⁵O neutrinos).\n\n### Impact of the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe premise is that the pp-III branch suddenly ceased its reactions about 8.5 minutes ago. Given that neutrinos travel from the Sun to Earth in approximately this amount of time, we would observe the immediate effect of this cessation.\n\nThe crucial consequence is the complete disappearance of the **⁸B neutrino flux**. All other neutrino sources, specifically the pp-II and CNO cycle reactions, remain unchanged.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the neutrino flux in each band after the pp-III branch stops:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** With the ⁸B neutrinos gone, the only remaining source of flux in this band is from the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle accounts for only about 1% of the Sun's energy production, and its associated neutrino flux is considerably lower than that from the main proton-proton chains.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** Although the ⁸B neutrino contribution is gone, this band continues to receive a very strong signal from the **⁷Be neutrinos at 861 keV**. This prominent, sharp energy line is one of the most significant features of the solar neutrino spectrum. A small contribution from the CNO cycle also remains.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nWe are asked to find the approximate ratio: Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2).\n\n*   **Numerator - Flux (band 1):** This flux is now solely from the CNO cycle, which is known to be very low. Looking at solar neutrino flux diagrams, the CNO contribution is several orders of magnitude smaller than the primary pp-chain fluxes.\n*   **Denominator - Flux (band 2):** This flux is now dominated by the intense ⁷Be neutrino line at 861 keV.\n\nThe total flux of ⁷Be neutrinos is about 5 x 10⁹ cm⁻² s⁻¹, while the total fluxes for ¹³N and ¹⁵O neutrinos (from the CNO cycle) are around 1.9 x 10⁷ cm⁻² s⁻¹ and 1.7 x 10⁷ cm⁻² s⁻¹, respectively. This shows that the total ⁷Be flux is roughly 100 times greater than the total CNO flux. This significant difference in magnitude between the parent reactions will be reflected in the specific energy bands in question.\n\nTherefore, the ratio will be approximately:\n\n(A very small flux from the CNO cycle) / (A very large flux from the ⁷Be line)\n\nThis results in a very small number. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) 1: Incorrect. The fluxes are vastly different.\n*   B) 10: Incorrect. The ratio is much less than 1.\n*   **C) 0.01 (10⁻²):** This implies the flux in Band 2 is about 100 times larger than in Band 1. This aligns perfectly with the known relative strengths of the ⁷Be and CNO neutrino fluxes.\n*   D) 0.1 (10⁻¹): While small, this likely underestimates the large dominance of the ⁷Be neutrino line.\n\nThe most reasonable approximation for the ratio is 0.01.\n\n<<<C>>>"
