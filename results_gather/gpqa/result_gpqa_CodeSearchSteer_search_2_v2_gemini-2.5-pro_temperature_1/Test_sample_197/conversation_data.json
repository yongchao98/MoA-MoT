    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must calculate its mole fraction relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe reactions for the formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are:\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺;      β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂];      β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻;    β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻;    β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration. For the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], the mole fraction (α₂) is:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the complex concentrations, we can derive a formula for α₂ that depends only on the ligand concentration [SCN⁻] and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe problem states that the initial concentration of thiocyanate is 0.1 M, which is in a 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration of 10⁻² M (0.01 M). In such problems, it is a common and intended simplification to assume that the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand is approximately equal to its initial total concentration.\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of each term in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to find the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
