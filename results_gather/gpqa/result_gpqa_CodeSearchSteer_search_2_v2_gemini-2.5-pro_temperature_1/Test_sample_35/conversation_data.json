    "To determine what is being observed, we must first calculate the rest-frame energy of the detected absorption line. The light from an object at a cosmological distance is stretched by the expansion of the universe, a phenomenon known as redshift (z). This causes the observed energy of the light to be lower than the energy it had when it was emitted.\n\n### 1. Calculating the Redshift (z)\n\nThe distance to the object is given as 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc). The relationship between distance and redshift in modern cosmology depends on parameters like the Hubble Constant (H₀), and the density of matter and dark energy. Using a standard ΛCDM cosmological model, a distance of 2.1 Gpc corresponds to a redshift (z) of approximately 0.5.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Rest-Frame Energy\n\nThe rest-frame energy (E_rest) can be calculated from the observed energy (E_obs) and the redshift (z) using the formula:\n\n*E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)*\n\nGiven:\n*   E_obs = 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n*   z ≈ 0.5\n\nCalculation:\n*   E_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.5)\n*   E_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * 1.5\n*   E_rest = 5.85 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\n### 3. Identifying the Absorption Line\n\nThe calculated rest-frame energy of approximately 5.85 micro-electron volts (μeV) is highly significant in radio astronomy. This value closely matches the energy of the hyperfine transition of neutral atomic hydrogen, known as the 21 cm line or H I line. This transition occurs due to a \"spin-flip\" in the electron relative to the proton in a hydrogen atom and has a precise energy of about 5.87 μeV.\n\nThe 21 cm line is a crucial tool for studying the interstellar medium (ISM). Observations of this line in the Milky Way can reveal the distribution and properties of neutral hydrogen gas.\n\n### 4. Characterizing the Medium\n\nThe question asks what this line would most likely be observed in within the Milky Way. The options distinguish between atomic and molecular gas, and between cold and warm phases.\n\n*   **Atomic vs. Molecular:** The 21 cm line originates from *neutral hydrogen atoms*, not molecules. Therefore, it is associated with the atomic interstellar medium.\n*   **Cold vs. Warm:** Neutral atomic hydrogen exists in different temperature phases. The two main stable phases are the cold neutral medium (CNM), with temperatures around 40–200 K, and the warm neutral medium (WNM), with temperatures around 5000–8000 K. While the 21 cm line can be seen in emission from both warm and cold gas, seeing it in *absorption* typically requires a cold cloud of gas situated in front of a hotter, background radiation source. The cold gas absorbs the radiation from the background source at the specific 21 cm wavelength. Therefore, this absorption line is a primary tracer of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\nBased on this analysis, the observed absorption line corresponds to the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen, which in the Milky Way is characteristic of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
