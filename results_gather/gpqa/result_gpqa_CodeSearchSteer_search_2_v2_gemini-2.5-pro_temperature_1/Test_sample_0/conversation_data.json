    "To determine if two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, we must consider the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. This principle states that a quantum state that exists for a limited time (its lifetime, τ or Δt) has an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This relationship is given by the formula:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the lifetime broadening or natural linewidth.\n*   **Δt** is the lifetime of the quantum state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in their energies. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the greater energy uncertainty, which is the primary limiting factor.\n\nLet's calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁): Using the formula ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt, we get:\n    ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂):\n    ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe total broadening is the sum of the individual uncertainties, but the resolvability is limited by the larger broadening of State 1 (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). The energy difference between the two levels, |E1 - E2|, must be significantly greater than this value.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy uncertainty of State 1.\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is significantly smaller than the energy uncertainty of State 1.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is much larger than the energy uncertainty of State 1 (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also smaller than the energy uncertainty of State 1.\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved, as it comfortably exceeds the natural linewidth caused by their finite lifetimes.\n\n<<<C>>>"
