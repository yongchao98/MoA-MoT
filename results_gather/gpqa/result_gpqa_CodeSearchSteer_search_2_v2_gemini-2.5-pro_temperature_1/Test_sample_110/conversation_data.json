    "The analysis of both reactions appears to be correct based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n**Reaction A: Michael Addition**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a bulky base.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. The base deprotonates the starting ketone to form an enolate. The only available α-proton is on carbon 6 (C6), as C2 is a quaternary carbon. The t-BuOK abstracts this proton to form the enolate at C6. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate in a conjugate addition.\n*   **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The resulting substituent at C6 is a `-(CH2)2COOEt` group.\n*   **Product Name (A):** To name the product, if we consider the propanoate as the parent chain, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3. The point of attachment on the ring is designated as C1 for naming purposes. The original C1 (carbonyl carbon) becomes C2, and the original C2 becomes C3. Therefore, the substituent is named (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl). The full IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches options A and C.\n\n**Reaction B: Michael Addition**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n*   **Catalyst:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon adjacent to the nitro group), which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the NO2 group. The resulting nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Product Structure:** The nucleophilic carbon from 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2-CH-NO2`) bonds to the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (`-CH(CH3)-`). The final structure after protonation is `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n*   **Product Name (B):** For IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group (-CN) has priority and its carbon is designated as C1. The longest carbon chain containing this group has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile. The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4. Thus, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches options B and C.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nBoth of these products correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
