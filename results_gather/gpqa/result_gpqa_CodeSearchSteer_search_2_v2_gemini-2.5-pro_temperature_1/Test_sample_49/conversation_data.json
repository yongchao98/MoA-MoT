    "In quantum field theory, the calculation of a Feynman diagram with `L` loops in four-dimensional spacetime typically involves an integration over `L` independent loop momenta. After performing the integration, a characteristic factor of `1/(4π)^2` appears for each loop. This factor arises from the momentum-space measure and the subsequent integration in `D=4` dimensions.\n\nThe general relationship is that an `L`-loop diagram contributes a factor proportional to `(1/(4π)^2)^L`, or `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nTo determine the number of loops, we can isolate the `1/(4π)` term and solve for `L`:\n\n1.  The expression contains the term `1/(4pi)^6`.\n2.  We set this equal to the expected factor for an `L`-loop diagram: `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n3.  By comparing the exponents, we get the equation: `2L = 6`.\n4.  Solving for `L` gives `L = 3`.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
