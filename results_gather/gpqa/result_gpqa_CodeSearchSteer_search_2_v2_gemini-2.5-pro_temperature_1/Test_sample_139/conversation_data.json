    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical riddle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85°C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where D is the deuterium isotope of hydrogen, is 3.82°C (276.97 K).\n    *   This strongly indicates that **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavier Isotope and Substance X:**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   Substance X incorporates this isotope and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, along with its \"very close analog\". This points to common deuterated reagents. The most common are lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) and sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their non-deuterated analogs, LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄, are staple reducing agents in organic chemistry.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The riddle describes the reaction: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W + Precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons. If we assume the gas is related to the deuterium isotope, Deuterium gas (D₂) fits this description perfectly. A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Reaction Confirmation:** For D₂ gas to be released, Substance X (the deuteride) must react with a source of deuterium. The most likely candidate for liquid Y is therefore heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   Let's test our candidates for X against this:\n        *   **If X is LiAlD₄:** LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂. This reaction produces D₂ gas.\n        *   **If X is NaBD₄:** NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4 D₂. This reaction also produces D₂ gas.\n\n4.  **Use the Precipitate Clue to Distinguish X:** A precipitate G is formed.\n    *   In the LiAlD₄ reaction, the products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). LiOD is soluble, but aluminum hydroxide (and by extension, Al(OD)₃) is famously insoluble in water and forms a gelatinous precipitate.\n    *   In the NaBD₄ reaction, the products are sodium deuteroxide (NaOD) and boric acid-d₃ (B(OD)₃). Both NaOD and boric acid are soluble in water.\n    *   The formation of a precipitate strongly indicates that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** and the precipitate G is Al(OD)₃.\n\n5.  **Final Clue Confirmation:**\n    *   **Heating G releases B:** Heating aluminum hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes it to decompose, releasing water (or heavy water): 2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O. This is consistent with G releasing B (D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction with keto acid:** Lithium aluminum hydride is a powerful reducing agent that reduces keto acids to diols. A keto acid contains a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group (3 oxygen atoms). The reduction product, a diol, contains two alcohol functional groups (2 oxygen atoms). This matches the clue that the product contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Violent Reaction:** LiAlH₄ is known to react violently with water. Its deuterated analog would behave similarly with heavy water. NaBH₄ reacts much more slowly with water, especially in neutral or basic conditions. The term \"violently\" further supports LiAlD₄ as Substance X.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (atomic mass ≈ 2 amu).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic mass ≈ 27 amu).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n    *   Mass of all lightest elements (4 Deuterium atoms): 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest elements (1 Aluminum atom): 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative sum: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
