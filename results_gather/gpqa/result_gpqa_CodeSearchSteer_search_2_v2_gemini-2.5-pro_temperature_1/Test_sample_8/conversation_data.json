    "Here is the analysis of the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n*   **A) Quinuclidine:** This is a bicyclic amine, C₇H₁₃N. It possesses a C₃ rotational axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen bond. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C₃ axis. Therefore, its point group is C₃v.\n\n*   **B) Triisopropyl borate:** The chemical formula for this molecule is [(CH₃)₂CHO]₃B. While a C₃ axis can be envisioned through the central boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms, the molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The bulky isopropyl groups will rotate to minimize steric hindrance, resulting in a propeller-like conformation. This conformation belongs to the C₃ point group, not C₃h.\n\n*   **C) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride (C₁₂O₉), is a planar aromatic system. It has a C₃ rotational axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring. Because the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). It does not possess any C₂ axes perpendicular to the main C₃ axis. The combination of a C₃ axis and a σh plane, without other symmetry elements, places this molecule in the C₃h point group.\n\n*   **D) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This molecule is built upon a larger triphenylene core. Triphenylene itself has D₃h symmetry. The addition of the three planar furan-dione rings maintains the planarity and high symmetry of the parent structure. The molecule has a C₃ axis, a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and also three C₂ axes perpendicular to the C₃ axis. The presence of these additional C₂ axes means the molecule belongs to the D₃h point group. While any molecule with D₃h symmetry necessarily contains all the symmetry elements of the C₃h group, its actual point group is D₃h.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecule whose point group is specifically C₃h is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
