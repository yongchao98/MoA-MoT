    "The quantum mechanical system described is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Energy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy levels are determined as follows:\n*   **Ground State:** $n=0$. $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that correspond to this energy. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n$.\n\nThe formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th energy level is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$. Plugging this into the formula gives:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, we can explicitly list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n*   The state (1, 1, 1) — 1 state\n\nThe total number of states is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.\n\nCombining the results, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<B>>>"
