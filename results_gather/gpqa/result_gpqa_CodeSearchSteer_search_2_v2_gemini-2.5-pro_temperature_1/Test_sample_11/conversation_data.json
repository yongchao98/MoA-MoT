    "The problem asks for the kinetic energies of the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) produced from the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺).\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation based on the principles of conservation of energy and momentum:\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Rest mass of the positive pion (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of the positive muon (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The pion is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered to have zero rest mass.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nSince the pion is at rest, its total initial energy is just its rest energy. After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** E_π = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** E_μ + E_ν = (KE_μ + m_μc²) + KE_ν\n    *   KE_μ is the kinetic energy of the muon.\n    *   KE_ν is the kinetic energy of the neutrino.\n\nEquating initial and final energy:\n139.6 MeV = (KE_μ + 105.7 MeV) + KE_ν\nKE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV\nKE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum of the stationary pion is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n\n*   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (m_c²)².\n\n*   **For the neutrino (massless):** E_ν² = (pc)² + 0, which means E_ν = pc. Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (KE_ν = E_ν). Therefore, KE_ν = pc.\n*   **For the muon:** E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)². We also know that E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc².\n\n**4. Solving for the Kinetic Energies:**\nWe can now solve for the unknown kinetic energies. A straightforward method is to find the momentum (pc) first.\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can express the muon's energy as E_μ = E_π - E_ν = m_πc² - pc.\n\nNow, substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n\nNow, solve for pc:\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\npc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\npc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to this momentum value.\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon using the total kinetic energy calculated in step 1:\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated values are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
