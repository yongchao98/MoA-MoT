    "To find the expectation value of the operator `10σ_z + 5σ_x`, we must first calculate the expectation value for `σ_z` and `σ_x` individually with respect to the given spin state and then combine them.\n\nThe spin state of the particle is given by the linear superposition:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\nHere, `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` are the eigenstates of the Pauli `σ_z` matrix, which are represented in matrix form as:\n*   `|↑⟩ = [[1], [0]]`\n*   `|↓⟩ = [[0], [1]]`\n\nThe Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` are defined as:\n*   `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n*   `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `O` for a state `|ψ⟩` is calculated as `⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`.\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of `σ_z`:**\n\nThe expectation value `⟨σ_z⟩` is the probability of measuring spin-up (`|0.5|^2`) times its eigenvalue (+1) plus the probability of measuring spin-down (`|(√3)/2|^2`) times its eigenvalue (-1).\n\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |(√3)/2|^2 * (-1)`\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25) - (3/4)`\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of `σ_x`:**\n\nTo find `⟨σ_x⟩`, we perform the matrix multiplication `⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩`.\n\nFirst, we find `σ_x|ψ⟩`:\n`σ_x|ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (0.5 * [[1], [0]] + (√3)/2 * [[0], [1]])`\n`σ_x|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [[0], [1]] + (√3)/2 * [[1], [0]]`\n`σ_x|ψ⟩ = (√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩`\n\nNext, we calculate `⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩`:\nThe bra vector `⟨ψ|` is `0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|`.\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * ((√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)`\nUsing the orthogonality of the states (`⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1`, `⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1`, `⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0`), we get:\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = 0.5 * (√3)/2 + (√3)/2 * 0.5`\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = (2√3)/4 = √3/2`\n\n**3. Calculate the total expectation value:**\n\nThe operator is `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`. The expectation value is:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10 * ⟨σ_z⟩ + 5 * ⟨σ_x⟩`\n`⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + (5√3)/2`\n\nNow, we approximate the numerical value:\n`√3 ≈ 1.732`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + (5 * 1.732) / 2`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 8.66 / 2`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
