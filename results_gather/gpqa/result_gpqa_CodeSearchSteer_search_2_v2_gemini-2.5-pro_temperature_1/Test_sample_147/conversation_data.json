    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the compounds and answer the question:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for A2 is YF_n. The molar mass of element Y (M_Y) can be related to the molar mass of fluorine (M_F ≈ 19.00 g/mol) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) by the equation:\n\nM_Y = ((1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196) * n * M_F\nM_Y ≈ (0.6804 / 0.3196) * 19.00 * n\nM_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe can test integer values for 'n':\n*   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium or Argon, which are unlikely candidates).\n*   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but BrF3 and BrF5 are the common fluorides, and their fluorine percentages do not match).\n*   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Let's check the fluorine percentage in SbF3: ω(F) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n*   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no stable element fits well).\n\nTherefore, element **Y is Antimony (Sb)**, and compound **A2 is SbF3** (antimony trifluoride).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Five Binary Fluorides of Antimony\n\nAntimony is known to form several binary fluorides. The main ones are SbF3 and SbF5. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is a powerful Lewis acid and can accept a fluoride ion (F-) to form complex anions like [SbF6]⁻, [Sb2F11]⁻, and [Sb3F16]⁻. This suggests the five compounds are likely related to these species or polymeric forms. The known binary fluorides or fluoride adducts are SbF3, SbF5, and anions formed with SbF5, such as those in K[SbF6], K[Sb2F11], and K[Sb3F16]. While not strictly binary compounds of only Y and F in the neutral sense, in the context of this problem, the polyfluoride anions are key. A search also reveals polymeric fluorides.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Compounds A1 and A3\n\n*   **A1** is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20°C) into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. It also oxidizes xenon. This points to a highly reactive, unstable, high-oxidation-state fluoride. While a simple higher binary fluoride of antimony like SbF7 is not well-established, polymeric or complex fluorides can be highly reactive. The description of a bright-red solid that decomposes near room temperature and oxidizes xenon is characteristic of some extremely powerful fluorinating agents, such as dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), also known as \"FOOF\". However, the problem states these are compounds of Y and Fluorine. A compound like tetrameric ruthenium pentafluoride, (RuF5)4, is known to be a dark red solid. In the realm of antimony, there are complex polymeric fluorides, but none are commonly described as bright-red. However, given the clues, A1 must be a higher fluoride that decomposes to the more stable SbF3. The decomposition is A1 → SbF3 + F2.\n\n*   **A3** is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and can also react with xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony produces antimony trifluoride (SbF3) or, with excess fluorine, antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). Since A3 reacts with xenon, it must be a very strong oxidizing agent. **SbF5** is an exceptionally strong Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing oxygen and being a component of superacids. Therefore, **A3 is SbF5**.\n\n### Step 4: Identify Compounds A4 and A5\n\nThe problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe reaction is: Y + A4 → A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\nSubstituting Y = Sb, we have: **Sb + A4 → A5**.\n\nThis is a comproportionation reaction where antimony metal reduces a higher-oxidation-state antimony fluoride (A4) to an intermediate one (A5).\n*   **A4** must be a stable, higher-valent fluoride of antimony. The most stable and common higher fluoride is **SbF5**. SbF5 is a colorless, viscous liquid.\n*   If A4 is SbF5, the reaction is Sb + SbF5 → A5. For a 1:1 molar ratio to be significant, it might imply a structural change. A known reaction involves the combination of antimony species. Let's consider the oxidation states. Sb(0) + Sb(+5) → ? A likely product would be an intermediate oxidation state, which is Sb(+3). So, the product A5 should be related to SbF3. However, the stoichiometry doesn't balance for a simple redox reaction (Sb + SbF5 -> 2SbF3 is not 1:1).\n\nLet's re-examine the clue. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". SbF5 is a liquid that can act as a solvent. The reaction could be forming a complex ion. A plausible reaction series is the formation of complex fluorides.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5. If A4 is SbF5, and A5 is SbF3, this doesn't fit the molar ratio.\n\nLet's look at the properties of A5. \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" SbF3 hydrolyzes, but this is a general property.\n\nLet's revisit the known fluorides and their reactions. We have identified A2=SbF3 and A3=SbF5. A1 is an unstable higher fluoride. This leaves A4 and A5.\nThe most common and stable fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5.\nIt is plausible that A4 is one of these, and A5 is another.\n\nLet's assume **A4 is SbF5**. The reaction is Sb + SbF5 → A5. This doesn't lead to a simple binary compound.\nLet's assume **A4 is SbF3**. Then Sb + SbF3 -> A5. This would be a reduction of Sb(III), which is unlikely.\n\nThere must be a different interpretation. Let's reconsider the set of five compounds. What if they are (SbF3), (SbF5), and related complex anions [Sb2F11]⁻, [Sb3F16]⁻, etc? The problem states *binary compounds*. This usually implies only two elements. The anions themselves aren't neutral compounds.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5. What if A4 is not a simple fluoride? The problem refers to a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This could imply A4 is a solute.\nConsider a different reaction: The reaction between antimony trichloride and antimony trifluoride can produce antimony chloride fluoride.\n\nLet's reconsider the most straightforward interpretation:\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A2 = SbF3\n*   A3 = SbF5\n*   A1 = An unstable higher fluoride of Sb.\n*   A4 and A5 are two other distinct binary fluorides.\n\nA known structural form of antimony pentafluoride is the tetramer, (SbF5)4. There are also polymeric forms. Let's stick with the simplest species first: SbF3 and SbF5. What could the other three be? Perhaps polymeric forms like (SbF3)n, (SbF5)n (e.g., n=4), and a mixed-valence compound. A well-known mixed-valence fluoride is Sb2F11⁻, formed from SbF5 and SbF6⁻.\n\nLet's go back to the most solid clue: A2 (ωF=31.96%) is SbF3.\nAnd A3 (strong oxidant, made by fluorinating Y) is SbF5.\nNow for the A4/A5 reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nIf A4 = SbF5, we have Sb + SbF5 -> A5. A 1:1 reaction could point to the formation of a dimeric species of an intermediate oxidation state, like [Sb-Sb]F5. This is highly speculative.\n\nLet's try a different approach. The options for the molecular weight of A4 are:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weights of our candidate compounds:\n*   **SbF3**: 121.76 + 3*19.00 = 178.76 g/mol\n*   **SbF5**: 121.76 + 5*19.00 = 216.76 g/mol\n\nLet's analyze the ranges:\n*   A) 110-130: Doesn't match SbF3 or SbF5.\n*   B) 160-180: This range includes the molecular weight of **SbF3** (178.76 g/mol).\n*   C) 220-240: This range is slightly too high for SbF5.\n*   D) 140-160: Doesn't match SbF3 or SbF5.\n\nIf **A4 is SbF3**, its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol, which falls squarely in the range of 160-180. Let's see if this fits the remaining clues.\n\nIf A4 = SbF3, the reaction is: Sb + SbF3 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio, in a hot concentrated solution).\nThis is a reaction between Sb(0) and Sb(III). This is a comproportionation to a lower oxidation state, Sb(I) or Sb(II), for example, something like \"SbF\". While SbF is not a stable molecule, subhalides of antimony exist. This path seems chemically less plausible than the oxidation of Sb metal by a higher valent fluoride.\n\nLet's re-read the A4/A5 clue carefully: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis describes the *synthesis* of A5. A4 is the starting material.\nLet's assume there was a typo in the molecular weight ranges and A4 is SbF5 (MW = 216.76). Range C is 220-240. This is close. If A4=SbF5, then Sb + SbF5 -> A5.\n\nThere must be a key piece of information being missed or misinterpreted. Let's reconsider the set of five compounds. Rhenium, Osmium, and Ruthenium also form multiple fluorides, but the mass percentage calculation pointed strongly to Antimony.\n\nLet's trust the calculation that A2 = SbF3 (MW = 178.76).\nLet's trust the logic that A3 = SbF5 (MW = 216.76).\n\nNow, let's revisit the options and our calculated molecular weights.\n*   MW(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol -> Fits range B (160-180)\n*   MW(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol -> Does not fit any range perfectly, but is closest to C (220-240).\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of **A4**.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Sb(Y) + A4 -> A5.\nThis reaction involves adding the element itself to one of its fluorides. This is a common way to produce a lower-valent halide from a higher-valent one (comproportionation).\nExample: 2 SbF5 + Sb -> (doesn't work well)\nExample: SiCl4 + Si -> 2 SiCl2 (at high temp)\nExample: PCl5 + P(red) -> PCl3 (not 1:1)\n\nThis implies that A4 has a higher oxidation state than A5. Therefore, A4 is likely SbF5. If A4=SbF5, the MW is 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fit any of the provided ranges well.\n\nLet's consider another possibility. What if the element Y is not Antimony?\nLet's recheck the mass percentage calculation for A2: M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n.\nIf n=4, M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is close to Dysprosium (162.5) or Terbium (158.9), but they are not known for forming 5 volatile/reactive fluorides.\nIf n=5, M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol. This is close to Bismuth (209.0). Let's check BiF5. ω(F) in BiF5 = (5 * 19) / (209 + 5*19) = 95 / 304 ≈ 31.25%. This is also a good match for 31.96%. Let's check BiF3: MW=266. BiF5: MW=304. Neither of these fit the A2 criteria.\n\nLet's return to Antimony (Sb) as the most probable identity for Y.\nA2 = SbF3 (MW ≈ 179).\nA3 = SbF5 (MW ≈ 217).\n\nLet's assume A4 is SbF3.\nMW(A4) = 178.76 g/mol. This falls in range **B) 160-180**.\nThe reaction becomes Sb + SbF3 -> A5. This is chemically strange. It would imply creating a sub-fluoride.\n\nLet's assume A4 is SbF5.\nMW(A4) = 216.76 g/mol. This is closest to range C (220-240).\nThe reaction becomes Sb + SbF5 -> A5. This is a comproportionation and is more chemically plausible. For example, it could form a mixed-valence compound.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction between the chemical logic (which suggests A4 is the higher fluoride, SbF5) and the given molecular weight ranges (where SbF3 fits perfectly into one range, while SbF5 fits poorly into another).\n\nLet's reconsider the problem statement.\n*   A1: Bright-red, decomposes to A2 + F2. So A1 is a higher fluoride than A2.\n*   A2: ωF=31.96% -> SbF3.\n*   A3: Y + F2 -> A3. Reacts with Xe. -> SbF5.\n*   Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\n\nThe reaction Y + A4 -> A5 strongly suggests A4 is a higher oxidation state fluoride and A5 is a lower one. So A4 should be SbF5. But its MW of 216.76 doesn't fit the ranges well.\n\nWhat if there is a mistake in my identification of A2?\nM_Y ≈ 40.45 * n. What if Y is Ruthenium (Ru, MW=101.1)?\nn=2 -> M_Y ≈ 80.9.\nn=3 -> M_Y ≈ 121.4.\nRuthenium forms RuF3, RuF4, RuF5, RuF6. That's four. Maybe (RuF5)4 is the fifth?\nLet's check ω(F) in RuF3: (3*19)/(101.1+57) = 57/158.1 ≈ 36.05%. Doesn't match.\nLet's check ω(F) in RuF4: (4*19)/(101.1+76) = 76/177.1 ≈ 42.9%. Doesn't match.\n\nLet's stick to Antimony. The evidence for Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 is strong.\nA2 = SbF3 (MW=178.76)\nA3 = SbF5 (MW=216.76)\n\nLet's re-evaluate the A4/A5 reaction. Is it possible that the roles are reversed? A4 + Y -> A5.\nMaybe A4 is a lower fluoride and it reacts with more Sb metal to form a cluster or subhalide. This is less common.\n\nLet's assume the most chemically sound process: comproportionation of a high-valent fluoride.\nA4 = SbF5. MW = 216.76. The closest range is C) 220-240. The discrepancy is about 1.5%.\nLet's assume A4 = SbF3. MW = 178.76. This fits perfectly in range B) 160-180.\nThe chemical reaction for A4=SbF3 is Sb(s) + SbF3(solution) -> A5. This is not a standard, simple reaction.\n\nHowever, in puzzle-like chemistry problems, sometimes a perfect fit for a numerical value is the intended clue, even if the associated chemistry is obscure. The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76) fits perfectly inside the 160-180 range. The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76) is outside the 220-240 range.\n\nIf we accept A4 = SbF3, then what is A5? Sb + SbF3 -> A5. And A5 decomposes in water into two substances. The nature of A5 is unclear, but we don't need to identify it, only A4.\n\nLet's weigh the evidence:\n1.  **Chemical Logic**: The reaction Y + A4 -> A5 suggests A4 is the higher-valent fluoride, SbF5.\n2.  **Numerical Fit**: The MW of SbF3 (178.76) fits perfectly in range B. The MW of SbF5 (216.76) does not fit well in any range.\n\nPerhaps the phrasing \"adding Y... to a ... solution of A4\" implies that Y is reacting with A4. It does not strictly mean A4 is the oxidant. However, it's the most common interpretation.\n\nLet's consider if the problem has a subtle trap. What if A4 is not a simple binary fluoride? The question asks for the molecular weight of \"substance A4\". For example, SbF5 can react with HF to form H[SbF6]. Could A4 be an acid? The problem says \"binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\". H[SbF6] is not a binary compound of Sb and F.\n\nLet's go with the strongest piece of evidence, which is the numerical match.\n*   Element Y is Antimony (Sb).\n*   A2 is SbF3. Its molecular weight is ~178.8 g/mol.\n*   The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4.\n*   Range B is 160-180 g/mol.\n*   SbF3 fits perfectly in this range.\n*   Let's hypothesize that A4 = SbF3.\n\nThe reaction is then Sb is added to a solution of SbF3 to make A5. While this is an unusual reaction, it is not impossible that it forms some sub-fluoride species A5 in solution, which then hydrolyzes. The key point is that we must identify one of the five binary compounds. SbF3 is one of them. Its molecular weight matches one of the ranges perfectly. SbF5 is another, but its molecular weight does not match any range well. Given that A4 must be one of the five compounds, and SbF3 is one of them, the most logical choice based on the given numeric ranges is that A4 is SbF3.\n\nFinal check:\n- Y = Sb\n- A1 = unstable higher fluoride (e.g. polymeric)\n- A2 = SbF3 (ωF ~31.9%)\n- A3 = SbF5 (oxidizes Xe)\n- A4 = SbF3 (MW = 178.76 g/mol, fits range 160-180)\n- A5 = product of Sb + SbF3.\nThis set of assignments is consistent with the clues, especially the numerical ones.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>"
