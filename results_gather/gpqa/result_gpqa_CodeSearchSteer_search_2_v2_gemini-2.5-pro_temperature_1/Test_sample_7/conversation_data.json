  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "To determine the relationship between the genes G1, G2, and G3, we must analyze the phenotypes of the single and double mutants compared to the wild-type (control) resistance level.\n\n### Analysis of the Experimental Data\n\n1.  **Single-Gene Effects:**\n    *   **Wild-type:** 100% resistance.\n    *   **g1 mutant (G1 knockout):** 75% resistance. This indicates G1 contributes to 25% of the plant's resistance.\n    *   **g2 mutant (G2 knockout):** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance, suggesting G2 plays an essential or critical role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   **g3 mutant (G3 knockout):** 50% resistance. This shows G3 is responsible for 50% of the plant's resistance.\n\n2.  **Double-Mutant Analysis (Epistasis):** Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of a double mutant matches the phenotype of one of the single mutants, effectively masking the effect of the other gene.\n    *   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the g2 single mutant (0% resistance), not the g1 mutant (75% resistance). Therefore, the *g2* mutation is epistatic to the *g1* mutation. This suggests G2 is essential for the pathway in which G1 also functions, or for a parallel pathway that is required for any resistance to be manifested.\n    *   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. Similarly, this phenotype matches the g2 single mutant. Thus, *g2* is also epistatic to *g3*.\n    *   **Conclusion on G2:** Since G2's knockout phenotype is total susceptibility (0% resistance) and it is epistatic to both G1 and G3, G2 is the most critical gene in this network. Given the prompt states at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the strongest candidate for being a master regulator transcription factor essential for the entire resistance response.\n\n3.  **Double-Mutant Analysis (Interaction between G1 and G3):**\n    *   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance.\n    *   If the effects of G1 and G3 were simply additive, the expected resistance would be 100% - 25% (loss from g1) - 50% (loss from g3) = 25%.\n    *   The observed resistance (10%) is much lower than the expected additive effect (25%). This greater-than-additive effect on susceptibility is known as a synergistic interaction. In genetics, this often points to **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform similar or compensatory functions in parallel pathways. Knocking out both genes reveals their shared importance, which is greater than the sum of their individual parts.\n    *   There is no epistasis between G1 and G3, because the double mutant phenotype (10%) is different from both the g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) phenotypes.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   G2 is the most likely transcription factor.\n*   G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (a synergistic interaction).\n*   G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. The statements \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" or \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" are incorrect.\n\nLet's re-examine the given choices:\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor and makes an unsupported claim about pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple unrelated traits), which cannot be determined from this experiment.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor but incorrectly claims G1 is epistatic to G3 and makes an unsupported claim about pleiotropy.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the most probable transcription factor and accurately describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. However, it incorrectly states that G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor but makes an unsupported claim about G1 and G3 sharing a promoter and incorrectly states that G3 is epistatic to G1.\n\nComparing the options, Option C contains two correct and crucial conclusions derived directly from the data (G2 as the TF candidate, and redundancy between G1 and G3). The third part of the statement (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect. However, the other options contain fewer correct statements and more unsupported claims. Therefore, Option C represents the best and most comprehensive conclusion that can be drawn from the experiment, despite the error in the final clause.\n\n<<<C>>>"
