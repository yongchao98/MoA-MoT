    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under several key assumptions. A review of these conditions shows that the law applies to a unipolar (single-carrier) device where the current is not limited by traps in the material. Furthermore, it assumes that one of the contacts is Ohmic, meaning it can act as an unlimited reservoir of charge carriers with no energy barrier for injection. The model also presumes that the dominant current transport mechanism is drift, which is driven by the electric field, and that the contribution from diffusion current is negligible.\n\nBased on these conditions, the statements can be evaluated as follows:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately reflects the primary conditions required for the Mott-Gurney law to be valid. \"No carrier injection barrier\" is synonymous with an ideal Ohmic contact.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the basic Mott-Gurney model is derived for a single-carrier (unipolar) device.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect. The space-charge-limited current is fundamentally a drift current; it is the diffusion current that is considered negligible.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact presents an energy barrier to charge injection, which violates the assumption of an ideal, barrier-free Ohmic contact required for the Mott-Gurney model.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that correctly describes the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
