    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n### 1. Definition of Non-Gaussianity\nThe measure of non-Gaussianity (`nG`) using relative entropy is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of a reference Gaussian state (`τ`) and the von Neumann entropy of the state in question (`ρ`). The reference state `τ` is a Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as `ρ`.\n\nThe formula is given by:\n`nG = S(τ) - S(ρ)`\nwhere `S(σ) = -Tr(σ ln σ)` is the von Neumann entropy.\n\n### 2. Entropy of the Initial State (`ρ`)\nThe given state is:\n`|ψ> = (cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>) / N`\n\nThis is a pure quantum state. The density matrix is `ρ = |ψ><ψ|`. For any pure state, the von Neumann entropy `S(ρ)` is zero.\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity simplifies to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(τ)`\n\n### 3. Moments of the State `ρ`\nTo define the reference Gaussian state `τ`, we first need to calculate the first and second moments of `ρ` for the given parameters `α = 0.5` and `φ = -π/4`.\n\n*   **Parameters**:\n    *   `α = 0.5`\n    *   `φ = -π/4` => `sin(2φ) = sin(-π/2) = -1`\n    *   `exp(-2α²) = exp(-2 * 0.5²) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065`\n\n*   **Normalization constant `N`**:\n    *   `N² = 1 + sin(2φ) * exp(-2α²) = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935`\n\n*   **First moment (mean displacement)** `<a>`:\n    *   For this state, the mean amplitude `<a> = <ψ|a|ψ>` is zero.\n\n*   **Second moments** `<a²>` and `<a†a>`:\n    *   The squeezing term is `<a²> = α² = 0.5² = 0.25`.\n    *   The mean photon number is `<n> = <a†a> = α² * (1 + exp(-2α²)) / (1 - exp(-2α²))`.\n    *   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * (1 + 0.6065) / (1 - 0.6065) ≈ 0.25 * (1.6065 / 0.3935) ≈ 1.0207`.\n\n### 4. Entropy of the Reference Gaussian State (`τ`)\nThe reference state `τ` is a Gaussian state (specifically, a squeezed thermal state) with `<n>_τ = 1.0207` and `<a²>_τ = 0.25`. The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state can be calculated from its covariance matrix `V`.\n\n*   **Covariance Matrix `V`**:\n    The determinant of the covariance matrix for a centered state (`<a>=0`) is given by:\n    `det(V) = (<n> + 1/2)² - |<a²>|²`\n    `det(V) ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)² - 0.25²`\n    `det(V) ≈ 1.5207² - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n\n*   **Von Neumann Entropy `S(τ)`**:\n    The entropy of the Gaussian state `τ` is calculated using the formula:\n    `S(τ) = (x + 1/2)ln(x + 1/2) - (x - 1/2)ln(x - 1/2)`, where `x = sqrt(det(V))`.\n\n    *   `x = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n    *   `S(τ) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(τ) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    *   `S(τ) = 2 * 0.6931 - 0`\n    *   `S(τ) ≈ 1.3862`\n\nThe calculated amount of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.386.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.38\nB) 2.48\nC) 0.25\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
