    "Here is a breakdown of the two reactions to determine the correct reagents:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The process involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone (butan-2-one). The cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the electrons from the carbon-oxygen double bond move to the oxygen, forming an alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH). Reagent A must be a source of protons. H₃O⁺ (hydronium, representing an acidic workup) is a suitable proton source to complete this step.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either acid or base. The options provide strong acid (HCl) and weak acid (CH₃COOH) as possibilities for reagent B. For the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, the nitrile is typically heated under reflux with a strong acid, such as dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl). While a weak acid might protonate the nitrile, a strong acid is generally required to drive the reaction to completion, through an amide intermediate, to form the final carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable reagents are:\n*   **A = H₃O⁺** for the cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **B = HCl** for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
