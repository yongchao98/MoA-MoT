    "The \"impulse approximation\" is a foundational concept in many-body nuclear physics that simplifies calculations of interactions, such as a particle scattering off a nucleus. It posits that the complex interaction with the entire nucleus can be treated as a much simpler interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. This approximation is valid under a specific set of assumptions about the nature of the interaction and the nuclear environment.\n\nThe key assumptions are:\n*   **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** The incoming probe (like an electron or neutrino) is assumed to interact with only one nucleon at a time. This is also known as the one-body current approximation, which neglects more complex multi-nucleon interactions. This corresponds to **assumption 1**.\n*   **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This implies that the probe enters, interacts with one nucleon, and then the outgoing particles leave the nucleus without any further interactions with the remaining nucleons. This is a core tenet of the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), where final-state interactions (FSI) are neglected. This matches **assumption 2**.\n*   **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** During the very brief moment of a high-energy interaction, the forces that bind the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus are considered negligible. The nucleon is treated as free, though it possesses momentum from its motion within the nucleus before the collision. This is **assumption 4**.\n\nAssumption 3, regarding the non-relativistic nature of the quarks within the nucleon, pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon itself. While models of nucleon structure are crucial for defining the interaction, the impulse approximation itself is concerned with the nucleon's behavior *within the nucleus*, not its sub-structure. The approximation uses the properties of a free nucleon (its form factors) as input, regardless of how those properties are theoretically described. Therefore, this is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
