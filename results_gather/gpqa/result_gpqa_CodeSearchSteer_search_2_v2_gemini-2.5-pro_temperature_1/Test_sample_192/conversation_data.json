    "To determine how the number of stars per unit distance changes, we first need to understand the relationships between the involved quantities: distance, parallax, and star counts.\n\n### Key Relationships\n\n1.  **Distance and Parallax:** The distance to a star (r) is inversely proportional to its parallax angle (plx). For distance in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds, the relationship is:\n    `r = 1 / plx` or `plx = 1 / r`.\n\n2.  **Star Counts:** The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\". This describes how the density of observed stars changes as a function of their parallax. We interpret this as the number of stars per unit of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, being proportional to `1/plx⁵`. This is a common way to represent a distribution in physics and astronomy.\n\n### Derivation\n\nOur goal is to find how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance, which is represented by the derivative `dN/dr`. We can relate `dN/dr` to the given quantity `dN/d(plx)` using the chain rule from calculus:\n\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n*   **First term `(dN/d(plx))`:** We are given that this is proportional to `1/plx⁵`. We can express this in terms of distance `r` by substituting `plx = 1/r`:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵ = r⁵`\n\n*   **Second term `(d(plx)/dr)`:** This is the derivative of the parallax with respect to distance. Since `plx = 1/r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (1/r) = -1/r²`\n\nNow, we multiply these two parts together. We are interested in the proportionality, so we can ignore the negative sign, which only indicates that parallax decreases as distance increases.\n\n`dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) = r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes in proportion to the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<D>>>"
