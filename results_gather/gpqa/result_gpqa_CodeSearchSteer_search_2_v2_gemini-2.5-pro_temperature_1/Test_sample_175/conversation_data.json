    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the probability.\n\n**1. Normalize the Initial State Vector**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩`:\n```\n|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ\n```\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nThe normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is obtained by dividing the vector by its norm (`√6`):\n```\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ\n```\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvector for the Measurement of P=0**\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\n```\nP = [[0,   1/√2, 0],\n     [1/√2, 0,   1/√2],\n     [0,   1/√2, 0]]\n```\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|p_0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. The eigenvalue equation is `P|p_0⟩ = 0 * |p_0⟩`. Let `|p_0⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`:\n```\n[[0,   1/√2, 0],   [x]   [0]\n [1/√2, 0,   1/√2], * [y] = [0]\n [0,   1/√2, 0]]   [z]   [0]\n```\nThis gives us the equations:\n1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form `[-z, 0, z]ᵀ`. We can choose `z=1` to get `[-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`. Now, we normalize this eigenvector:\n-   Squared norm = `(-1)² + 0² + 1² = 2`\n-   Normalized eigenvector `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Measuring P=0**\n\nThe probability of measuring the value 0 for the observable P is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvector `|p_0⟩`:\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\n`⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]] * [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ]`\n`= (1/√12) * [(-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1)]`\n`= (1/√12) * (1 + 0 + 1) = 2/√12 = 2/(2√3) = 1/√3`\n\nThe probability is the square of this value:\n`Prob(P=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n**4. Determine the State After the First Measurement**\n\nAfter measuring P and getting the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|p_0⟩`. So, the new state of the system `|ψ'⟩` is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q=-1**\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. The operator Q is:\n```\nQ = [[1,  0,  0],\n     [0,  0,  0],\n     [0,  0, -1]]\n```\nWe want to find the probability of getting the result -1. Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector `|q_{-1}⟩` for the eigenvalue -1 is:\n`|q_{-1}⟩ = [0, 0, 1]ᵀ`\n\nThe probability of measuring Q=-1 in the state `|ψ'⟩` is:\n`Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²`\n\n`⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = [[0, 0, 1]] * [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]ᵀ]`\n`= (1/√2) * [(0)(-1) + (0)(0) + (1)(1)]`\n`= 1/√2`\n\nThe probability is the square of this value:\n`Prob(Q=-1) = (1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n**6. Calculate the Joint Probability**\n\nThe final probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the probabilities calculated in steps 3 and 5:\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\n<<<D>>>"
