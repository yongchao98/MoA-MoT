    "Here is a breakdown of the observations and an evaluation of the possible explanations:\n\n### Analysis of the Observations\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H). This indicates the presence of two different, yet very similar, chemical environments for that proton. Since spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, the two environments must arise from two distinct species in solution. The observation of separate peaks means that the two species are not rapidly interconverting on the NMR timescale (typically milliseconds).\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:** The analysis shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram, confirming the presence of two distinct compounds that can be separated. Crucially, both peaks give the identical mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecular weight of the target peptide. This means the two species are isomers—they have the same chemical formula but different structures. The fact they separate on a standard LC column means they have different physical properties (like polarity/hydrophobicity). The use of elevated temperature in the LC-MS often helps to either \"freeze\" an equilibrium between two isomers or improve the resolution of closely eluting peaks.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and give the exact same spectrum, so you would only see one peak for the alpha-proton. Similarly, enantiomers are not separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers give different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons, like the alpha-proton, would have different chemical shifts, leading to two separate peaks.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. Since they have the same chemical formula, they will have the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Source in Peptides:** There are two very common sources of diastereomers in synthetic peptides. The first is **epimerization**, where the stereochemistry at one of the amino acid alpha-carbons is inverted during synthesis. The second, and a very common reason for peak doubling in peptide NMR, is **cis-trans isomerism** around an amide (peptide) bond. These *cis* and *trans* isomers are a specific type of diastereomer called rotamers, which can interconvert slowly enough on the NMR timescale to give separate signals and can sometimes be separated by LC. Both epimerization and cis-trans isomerism lead to the formation of diastereomers, making this the most plausible explanation.\n\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The LC-MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the expected product, ruling out contamination by a precursor.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This side reaction would involve the addition of an extra amino acid or coupling group, resulting in a product with a significantly different (and higher) mass. Again, this is inconsistent with the MS data showing a mass that matches the expected molecule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe observation of two distinct species by both NMR and LC that have the same mass is the classic signature of a mixture of isomers. Because they are distinguishable by standard NMR and LC techniques, they must be diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
