    "The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common piece of laboratory slang in organic chemistry. It refers to the difficulty or failure in separating two or more compounds using chromatography.\n\nIn a synthetic organic chemistry lab, chromatography is a primary technique for purifying compounds and monitoring the progress of a reaction. The most common forms are Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography. These methods separate molecules based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This partitioning is governed by the polarity of the compounds.\n\nIf two compounds have very similar polarities, they will interact with the stationary and mobile phases in almost the same way. This causes them to travel at nearly the same rate.\n*   On a TLC plate, this results in two spots that do not separate and appear as a single, overlapping spot.\n*   In column chromatography, this phenomenon is called \"co-elution,\" where the different compounds exit the column at the same time, resulting in mixed fractions instead of pure compounds.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely referring to the similar polarities of their compounds, which prevents their separation by chromatography.\n\n*   **A) Similar boiling points** would be a problem for separation by distillation, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is characteristic of a chromatographic separation.\n*   **C) Similar optical rotations** relates to a specific physical property of chiral molecules and is not a basis for the common separation techniques mentioned.\n*   **D) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions** are the underlying physical forces related to polarity, but \"similar polarities\" is the direct property that dictates the outcome of the chromatographic separation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
