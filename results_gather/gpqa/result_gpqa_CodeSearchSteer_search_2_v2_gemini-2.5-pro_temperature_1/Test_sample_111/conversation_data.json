    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Normalization of the State Vector\n\nThe given state `|alpha>` is proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nFirst, we need to normalize this state. Let the unnormalized state be `|alpha'> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\n\nThe norm squared of this state is:\n`<alpha'|alpha'> = |(1+i)|^2 + |(2-i)|^2`\n`<alpha'|alpha'> = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = (1+1) + (4+1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is `C = 1/sqrt(<alpha'|alpha'>) = 1/sqrt(7)`.\n\nSo, the normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\nIn matrix form, using `|up> = [[1], [0]]` and `|down> = [[0], [1]]`, the state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\n### 2. The Operator and its Eigenstates/Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A is given by the matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `0` otherwise. In a 2x2 basis, this is:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli matrix `σ_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`λ`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ_1 = +hbar/2` and `λ_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   **For λ_1 = +hbar/2**:\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [[x], [y]] = (hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n    `[[y], [x]] = [[x], [y]]`\n    This implies `x = y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v_1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For λ_2 = -hbar/2**:\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [[x], [y]] = -(hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n    `[[y], [x]] = [[-x], [-y]]`\n    This implies `x = -y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v_2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [-1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculation of Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the particle in an eigenstate `|v_i>` is given by `P_i = |<v_i|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability for eigenstate `|v_1>` (eigenvalue +hbar/2):**\n    `<v_1|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v_1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1+i+2-i) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P_1 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability for eigenstate `|v_2>` (eigenvalue -hbar/2):**\n    `<v_2|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v_2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1+i-2+i) = (-1+2i)/sqrt(14)`\n    `P_2 = |(-1+2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Average Value\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`. It can also be calculated as the sum of the eigenvalues weighted by their respective probabilities:\n`<A> = P_1 * λ_1 + P_2 * λ_2`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
