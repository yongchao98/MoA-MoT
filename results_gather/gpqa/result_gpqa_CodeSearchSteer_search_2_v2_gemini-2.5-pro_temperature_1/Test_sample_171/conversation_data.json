    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem related to stellar atmospheres. I have already formulated a step-by-step derivation based on the Boltzmann equation.\n\n1.  **State the Boltzmann Equation**: Describes the ratio of populations of two energy levels.\n    (N_b / N_a) = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)) \n\n2.  **Apply to the two stars**:\n    *   Star 1 (temp T_1): (N₂/N₁)_₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   Star 2 (temp T_2): (N₂/N₁)_₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n3.  **Use the given condition**: \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited ... when compared to ... star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large in star 1.\n    (N₂/N₁)_₁ = 2 * (N₂/N₁)_₂\n\n4.  **Substitute and solve**:\n    (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n    Take the natural log (ln) of both sides:\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\n5.  **Use the given numerical values**:\n    *   Energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    *   Boltzmann constant k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    *   The ratio ΔE / k ≈ 1.\n\n6.  **Final Equation**:\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n    ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThis matches option A. The logic is sound and confirmed by the principles of statistical mechanics applied to stellar atmospheres, specifically the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which the problem states is valid. The provided numerical values are key to simplifying the final expression.\n\nThe derivation is straightforward and does not require further searching. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nThe problem relies on the Boltzmann equation, which describes the population of atomic energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_j and N_i are the number of atoms in the higher energy state j and lower energy state i, respectively.\n*   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels (ΔE).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's apply this equation to each star:\n\nFor star 1, with temperature T_1:\n(N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star 2, with temperature T_2:\n(N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This means the ratio of the population of the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star 1 as it is for star 2:\n\n(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relation:\n\n(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * { (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] }\n\nThe statistical weight factor (g_j / g_i) cancels out from both sides:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln{exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]} = ln{2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]}\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln{exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]}\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):\n\nΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nCombine the terms in the parenthesis:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, has a value of approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting this value into our derived equation:\n\n1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
