    "To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must first understand the single-particle energy levels and then fill them according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nWhere 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). The problem defines the base energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the energy for each level `n` is simply:\n\nE_n = n²E\n\nThis gives us the following single-particle energy levels:\n*   E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on.\n\n### Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the quantum number 'n' and the spin (up or down). This means each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### System Energies\n\nTo find the total energy of the four-particle system, we sum the energies of the individual particles.\n\n**Ground State (Lowest Energy)**\n\nTo achieve the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   Two particles go into the n=1 level (E₁ = 1E).\n*   The remaining two particles go into the n=2 level (E₂ = 4E).\n\nThe total ground state energy is:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**First Excited State**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   The ground state configuration is two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (E₃ = 9E).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**Second Excited State**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider the different ways to create a higher energy state from the ground state configuration:\n1.  **Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3:** This would result in one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**\n2.  **Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3:** This would result in two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**\n3.  **Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4:** This would result in two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**\n\nComparing these possible energies (18E, 20E, and 22E), the lowest one is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
