    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE) over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2^3 = 8 possible configurations.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states, calculate the energy for each, and determine the Boltzmann factor.\n\nThe states can be grouped by their energy levels:\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n*   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    *   E₁ = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n*   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    *   E₂ = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n\nThere are **two** states with an energy of **-3J**. The contribution to the partition function from these states is 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ).\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n*   **Two spins are +1, one is -1:**\n    *   **State 3:** (+1, +1, -1) -> E₃ = -J [ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = J\n    *   **State 4:** (+1, -1, +1) -> E₄ = -J [ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = J\n    *   **State 5:** (-1, +1, +1) -> E₅ = -J [ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = J\n*   **One spin is +1, two are -1:**\n    *   **State 6:** (+1, -1, -1) -> E₆ = -J [ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = J\n    *   **State 7:** (-1, +1, -1) -> E₇ = -J [ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = J\n    *   **State 8:** (-1, -1, +1) -> E₈ = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = J\n\nThere are **six** states with an energy of **J**. The contribution to the partition function from these states is 6 * e^(-βJ) = 6e^(-Jβ).\n\n**Calculating the Partition Function (Z)**\nThe partition function is the sum of the contributions from all possible states:\nZ = (Contribution from E = -3J) + (Contribution from E = J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
