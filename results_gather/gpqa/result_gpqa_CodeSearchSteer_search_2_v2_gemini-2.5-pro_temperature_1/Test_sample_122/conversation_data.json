    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the ejecta's frame of reference and the Galaxy's frame of reference is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time that has passed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time, Δt₀) is 50 seconds.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame of reference.\n\n3.  **Apply the concept of Time Dilation:**\n    From the perspective of the Galaxy (the \"stationary\" frame), time for the moving ejecta will appear to pass more slowly. Conversely, the 50 seconds that passed on the ejecta's clock will correspond to a longer duration in the Galaxy's frame. This dilated time (Δt) is what we must use to calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the time in the two reference frames.\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    First, find the ratio v/c:\n    v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    Now, substitute this into the Lorentz factor equation:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n    γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206\n\n5.  **Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's reference frame:**\n    The formula for time dilation is Δt = γ * Δt₀.\n    Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s\n    Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n\n6.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame:**\n    The distance (d) is the velocity (v) multiplied by the time (Δt) in that frame.\n    d = v * Δt\n    d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s\n    d ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option D. A more precise calculation is:\nd = 60,000 km/s * (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km ≈ 3,061,862 km.\n\nThis value rounds to 3,060,000 km.\n\n*   Option A (2,940,000 km) would be the result of incorrectly applying length contraction to the distance.\n*   Option B (2,880,000 km) does not correspond to a standard relativistic or classical calculation in this context.\n*   Option C (3,000,000 km) is the classical, non-relativistic answer (60,000 km/s * 50 s), which ignores the effects of time dilation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer accounts for time dilation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
