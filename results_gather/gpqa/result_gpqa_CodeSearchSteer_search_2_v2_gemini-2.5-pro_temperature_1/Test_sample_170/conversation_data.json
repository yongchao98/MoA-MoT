    "To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in the electrophilic bromination of the given substances, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring. The yield of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituent is an ortho-, para-director or a meta-director, and by the substituent's size.\n\n**Analysis of Substituents:**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two main groups:\n1.  **Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. All activating groups and halogens fall into this category.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro):** Deactivating, but ortho-, para-director.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-director.\n\n2.  **Meta-Directing Groups:** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethoxycarbonyl):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxyl):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**Ranking the Substances:**\n\n**1. Meta-Directors (Lowest para-yield):**\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of ortho and para products is inherently very small. The order among them depends on the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing effect.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating, meta-directing groups. The bromination reaction is very slow and produces almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The carboxylic acid group is also a strong deactivator and meta-director. Its deactivating effect is slightly less than the nitro group, leading to a marginally higher, yet still very low, yield of the para-isomer compared to nitrobenzene.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The ethyl ester group is a deactivator and meta-director, comparable in strength to the carboxylic acid group. Some sources indicate that for nitration, it yields a slightly higher percentage of the para-isomer (~5-8%) compared to other strong deactivators.\n\nBased on the strength of the deactivating effect, the order of increasing para-yield for these three is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-Directors (Highest para-yield):**\nFor these groups, both ortho and para products are formed. The ratio between them (and thus the percentage of para-isomer) is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group is relatively small. Bromination of toluene yields a significant amount of both ortho and para products. A typical distribution for bromination is about 33% ortho and 66% para.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors substitution at the ortho position, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. The para-isomer is strongly favored.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are ortho-, para-directors but are deactivating overall. The chlorine atom's steric hindrance is significant, and its electronic effects also favor para substitution. Data for nitration shows chlorobenzene gives about 64-70% para product, which is higher than for toluene's nitration. For bromination, the para-selectivity is even higher, often around 87-89%.\n\nComparing the typical para yields for the ortho-, para-directors:\n*   Toluene (-CH3): ~66% para\n*   Chlorobenzene (-Cl): ~87% para\n*   Ethylbenzene (-C2H5): >90% para (higher than toluene due to sterics)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Final Combined Order:**\n\nCombining the two groups, the overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n-NO2 (4) < -COOH (6) < -COOC2H5 (2) < -CH3 (1) < -Cl (3) < -C2H5 (5)\n\nThis corresponds to the order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\nLet's re-examine the options and the established order. My derived order does not match any of the provided options exactly. Let me re-evaluate the relative positions of -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), and -Cl (3).\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** C2H5 > CH3. So, para yield for 5 > 1. This is consistent.\n*   **-Cl vs Alkyl groups:** Comparing -Cl with alkyl groups is nuanced. Data for nitration often shows: Toluene (37% para), Chlorobenzene (70% para). This suggests para yield for 3 > 1.\n*   **-Cl vs -C2H5:** This is the most critical comparison. Steric bulk of ethyl is generally considered greater than chloro, which would suggest para yield for 5 > 3.\n\nLet's reconsider my order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\nLet's check the options again.\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nOption C is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This is very close to my derived order, only differing in the placement of 5 (ethyl) and 3 (chloro). Option C suggests para yield for ethylbenzene is less than for chlorobenzene.\nLet's check literature values again specifically for bromination:\n*   Bromination of Toluene (1): ~66% para.\n*   Bromination of Chlorobenzene (3): ~87% para.\n*   Bromination of Ethylbenzene (5): ~94% para (one source claims this), another suggests it should be simply \"more than toluene\".\n\nIf we strictly follow the steric hindrance argument, the order of bulk is -C2H5 > -CH3. The position of -Cl is complex. If the data holds that Chlorobenzene gives ~87% para and Ethylbenzene gives more than Toluene (66%) but potentially less than Chlorobenzene, then option C might be correct. However, most sources point to increasing steric hindrance of the alkyl chain leading to progressively higher para-selectivity (Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Isopropylbenzene). This would make the order 1 < 3 < 5 or 1 < 5 < 3 depending on where Cl fits.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the meta-directors in option C: 4 < 6 < 2. This part is consistent with our analysis.\nLet's re-evaluate the ortho-para directors in option C: 1 < 5 < 3.\nThis means: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\nPara %: ~66% < (more than 66%) < ~87%. This is plausible. It suggests that the para-directing effect of chlorine (combination of electronic and steric factors) results in a higher para yield than the purely steric argument for the ethyl group relative to the methyl group.\n\nLet's consider another possibility. Is it possible that the order is 4 < 2 < 6? This would mean Benzoic Acid (-COOH) gives more para-isomer than Ethyl Benzoate (-COOC2H5). This is unlikely, as the bulkier ester group might slightly favor para over ortho compared to the COOH group, even in the trace amounts formed. So the 4 < 6 < 2 order is the most chemically sound for the meta-directors.\n\nGiven the options, C: **4<6<2<1<5<3** seems the most plausible, although the relative order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3) can be debated. However, the order among the meta-directors (4<6<2) and the fact that toluene (1) has the lowest para-yield among the o,p-directors is firm. The high para-selectivity of halogens is also a well-established fact. The question then hinges on whether ethylbenzene's para-yield surpasses that of chlorobenzene. Without definitive, directly comparable experimental data for bromination under identical conditions, and given the multiple-choice format, we must choose the best fit. Option C aligns well with the majority of the chemical principles.\n\nFinal Check:\n*   Lowest para yield: -NO2 (4). Correct.\n*   Order of meta-directors: -NO2 (4) < -COOH (6) < -COOC2H5 (2). Correct.\n*   Lowest yield among o,p directors: -CH3 (1). Correct.\n*   Order of highest yields: The question is between (1 < 5 < 3) and (1 < 3 < 5). Both are plausible depending on exact conditions. Option C presents 1 < 5 < 3. This means Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. This is a reasonable ranking.\n\n<<<C>>>"
