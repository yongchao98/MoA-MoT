    "This problem involves the dissociation of a stable complex, Ca-EDTA, in solution. To find the concentration of free calcium ions, we need to consider the equilibrium of this dissociation.\n\n1.  **The reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex ([Ca-EDTA]²⁻) dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (Y⁴⁻).\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **The equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f) for the complex, which is 5x10¹⁰. The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5x10¹⁰\n\n3.  **Setting up the calculation:** Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates from the complex at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, the concentration of Y⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ complex will be its initial concentration minus 'x'.\n\n    *   Initial concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n    *   Initial concentration of [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n    *   Initial concentration of [Y⁴⁻] = 0 M\n    *   Equilibrium concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 - x\n    *   Equilibrium concentration of [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   Equilibrium concentration of [Y⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Solving the equilibrium expression:** We can now substitute these values into the formation constant expression.\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = 5x10¹⁰\n\n5.  **Simplification:** Because the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation of the complex will be minimal. This means that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore simplify the expression by approximating (0.02 - x) to 0.02.\n    5x10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now, we solve for x, which represents the calcium ion concentration.\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5x10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4x10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
