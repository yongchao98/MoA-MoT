    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants\n\n1.  **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride**: A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are on a double bond.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks: one at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and one at 165 ppm (anhydride carbonyl carbon, C=O).\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (~7.2 ppm) and due to its C₂v symmetry, it has two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n\n2.  **Diene**: The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups at positions C1, C2, C3, and C4. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n\n### Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products\n\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride). This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is consistent with the combination of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction typically yields two stereoisomeric products:\n*   The **major product** is the *endo* adduct, formed via a transition state with stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   The **minor product** is the *exo* adduct, which is often more sterically stable but kinetically disfavored.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the Products and their NMR Signals\n\nThe product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton. Key proton groups are:\n*   **H_anhydride**: Two equivalent protons on C2 and C3, originating from maleic anhydride. They appear as a **2H singlet around 3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Me_alkene**: Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C5, C6). Vinylic methyl groups typically resonate as a **6H singlet around 1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Me_bridgehead**: Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These alkyl methyls appear as a **6H singlet around 1.0 ppm**.\n*   **H_bridge**: Two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge. They would give two separate 1H signals. The problem describes one of these as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n### Step 4: Differentiate Between *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers using NOESY\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates their spatial proximity. The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This allows us to identify the stereochemistry.\n\n*   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C5=C6 double bond. This geometry places the H_anhydride protons (on C2, C3) pointing away from the double bond and close to the C7 methylene bridge protons (specifically the *anti*-proton) and the bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead).\n*   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the double bond. This places the H_anhydride protons pointing towards the double bond, making them close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n\nThe crucial NOE cross-peak, which is present only in the major (*endo*) product, must correspond to a proximity unique to that isomer. The possibilities are:\n1.  **H_anhydride ↔ Me_bridgehead**: An interaction between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm.\n2.  **H_anhydride ↔ H_bridge**: An interaction between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and one of the 1H signals for the bridge protons, given as ~1.5 ppm.\n\nConversely, the NOE between **H_anhydride ↔ Me_alkene** (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) would be characteristic of the *exo* (minor) product.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's match the predicted NOEs with the given choices:\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: This corresponds to an NOE between Me_bridgehead and Me_alkene. The distance between these groups is not expected to differ significantly between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to an NOE between one of the **H_bridge** protons and the **H_anhydride** protons. This proximity is a key feature of the **endo** isomer. This is a strong candidate.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This is an NOE between **Me_bridgehead** and an **H_bridge** proton. This distance should be similar in both isomers.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to an NOE between **Me_alkene** and **H_anhydride** protons. This proximity is characteristic of the ***exo*** **(minor)** product. Since the cross-peak is observed in the major product, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option describing an NOE interaction that is uniquely present (or significantly stronger) in the major *endo* product is the one between the anhydride protons and a bridge proton.\n\n<<<B>>>"
