    "A textile dye absorbs light energy, which causes its electrons to move to a higher energy level. When these electrons return to their ground state, they emit light. The color of the light emitted is complementary to the color of the light that was absorbed.\n\nFirst, we calculate the wavelength of the emitted light using the given energy value. The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula:\n\nE = hc/λ\n\nwhere:\n*   h is Planck's constant (4.1357 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s)\n*   c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10⁸ m/s)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for wavelength:\n\nλ = hc / E\nλ = (4.1357 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s × 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s) / 2.3393 eV\nλ ≈ 5.30 x 10⁻⁷ meters, which is equal to 530 nanometers (nm).\n\nA wavelength of 530 nm corresponds to green or yellowish-green light in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe color of light absorbed by the compound is the complementary color of the light it emits. The complementary color to green or yellowish-green light is in the violet or purple region of the spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the color of light absorbed by the organic compound is violet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
