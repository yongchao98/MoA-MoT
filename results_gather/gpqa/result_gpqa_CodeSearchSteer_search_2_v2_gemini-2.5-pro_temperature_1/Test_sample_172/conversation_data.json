    "To solve this problem, we will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n*   Uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Speed of the electron (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n**2. Physical Principles:**\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle** for position and momentum states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to a constant value. The most precise form of this principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π). For a minimum uncertainty calculation, we use the equality: Δp_min = ħ / (2 * Δx).\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** Since the electron's speed (2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), we must use the relativistic formula for energy: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where p is the momentum and m₀ is the rest mass of the electron.\n*   **Uncertainty Propagation:** To find the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) from the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), we can use the relationship ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp. Differentiating the energy-momentum equation with respect to momentum gives dE/dp = v, where v is the particle's velocity. Therefore, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ v * Δp.\n\n**3. Constants:**\n*   Reduced Planck's constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n**4. Calculation Steps:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n    Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    Δp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δp = 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n    Using the derived relation for relativistic particles:\n    ΔE = v * Δp\n    ΔE = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE = 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. This value is on the order of magnitude of 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
