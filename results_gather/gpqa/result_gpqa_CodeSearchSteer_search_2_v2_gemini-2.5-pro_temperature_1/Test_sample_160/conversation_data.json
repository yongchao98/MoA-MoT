    "Based on the principles of kinetic theory and particle physics, we can determine the relationship between the two mean free paths, λ1 and λ2.\n\n*   **λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):** This is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other. It is determined by the number density of the gas (n), and the kinetic collision cross-section of the molecules (σ_gg). A key detail is that since the target molecules are also in motion, a correction factor of the square root of 2 is included in the formula.\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):** This is the mean free path for the high-energy electrons from the beam as they scatter off the residual gas molecules. The number density (n) of the gas molecules is the same. However, two things are different:\n    1.  The collision cross-section is now the scattering cross-section between a high-energy electron and a gas molecule (σ_eg).\n    2.  The electrons are moving at relativistic speeds (1 MeV is ~94% the speed of light), while the gas molecules are comparatively stationary. Therefore, the √2 correction factor for target motion is not used.\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n**Comparing the Mean Free Paths**\n\nThe relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends on the ratio of the collision cross-sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg).\n\n*   **Kinetic Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is essentially the effective physical size of the gas molecules when they collide. It's related to the area presented by one molecule to another.\n\n*   **Electron Scattering Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This describes the probability of a high-energy (1 MeV) electron being scattered by a gas molecule. For very high-energy electrons, the interaction time with a gas molecule is extremely short. This makes a scattering event less likely compared to a collision between two larger gas molecules. Consequently, the scattering cross-section for a 1 MeV electron is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that **σ_gg > σ_eg**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n\nSince σ_gg is significantly larger than σ_eg, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number greater than 1. This means:\n\nλ2 / λ1 > √2\nλ2 > 1.414 * λ1\n\nReviewing the given options, the only one that matches this physical reality is that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Option D states that λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ1, which is consistent with our finding that λ2 must be greater than 1.414 * λ1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
