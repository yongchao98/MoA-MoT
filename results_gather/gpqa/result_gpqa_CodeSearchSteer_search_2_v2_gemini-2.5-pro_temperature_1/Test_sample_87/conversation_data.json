    "The experiment described is a classic illustration of a germinal center reaction within the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Here's a breakdown of the events and how they point to the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery to Peyer's Patches:** The oral gavage delivers the GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins to the gastrointestinal tract. Peyer's patches, which are key immune surveillance sites in the small intestine, take up these antigens. The fluorescence observed in the Peyer's patches confirms the antigen has reached its target lymphoid tissue.\n\n2.  **B Cell Activation and Proliferation:** In the Peyer's patches, antigen-presenting cells present the viral proteins to B lymphocytes (B cells). B cells that recognize the antigen become activated and begin to proliferate rapidly within specialized microenvironments called germinal centers. This matches the observation of an isolated \"proliferating cell population.\"\n\n3.  **Generation of Variability:** The crucial finding is the \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating B cells. This points directly to a process that introduces mutations into the antibody genes *after* an immune response has been initiated.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is part of the innate immune system and does not involve genetic changes to lymphocyte receptors.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial, vast diversity of B cell receptors *before* a B cell ever encounters an antigen. It occurs in the bone marrow during B cell development, not in a secondary lymphoid organ like a Peyer's patch following antigen stimulation.\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process specifically takes place in activated, proliferating B cells within germinal centers. It introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This process aims to create antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen. The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a Peyer's patch is the definition of somatic hypermutation.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in germinal center B cells, often alongside SHM. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which alters the antibody's function (e.g., changing from IgM to IgG or IgA), not its antigen-binding specificity. The question specifically notes variability in the *variable* region, making SHM the direct answer.\n\nTherefore, the process responsible for the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
