    "To determine the correct option, we must analyze both parts of the question: which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which shows optical isomerism (B).\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Because it lacks alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone does not undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to hydrogen atoms. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows it to undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable because it is aromatic.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a methyl group (–CH₃)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (–OH)\n    3.  a hydrogen atom (–H)\n    4.  an ester group (–COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The chemical formula is CH₃OOC–CH=CH–COOCH₃. This molecule is a trans-isomer and does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the double bond are each bonded to only three groups. Therefore, it does not have a chiral center and is not optically active.\n\nThus, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   (A) is benzoquinone.\n*   (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
