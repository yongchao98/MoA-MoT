    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the relative speed and total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let `v1 = 0.6c` be the velocity of the first astronaut and `v2 = 0.5c` be the velocity of the second astronaut.\n\nThe formula for relative velocity (`v_rel`) is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the total energies of its individual particles. The total energy `E` of a single particle is given by the equation `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):**\n\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ1`:\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n    `γ1 = 1.25`\n\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E1`:\n    `E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c^2`\n    `E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c^2`\n    `E1 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):**\n\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ2`:\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E2`:\n    `E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2`\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n\n*   The total energy is the sum of `E1` and `E2`:\n    `E_total = E1 + E2`\n    `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2`\n    `E_total ≈ 5.9641 mc^2`\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the calculations:\n*   The relative speed `v_rel` is approximately **0.14c**.\n*   The total energy `E` is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
