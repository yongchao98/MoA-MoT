    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we must analyze the physical principles governing planetary density and compare the given options.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is functionally a planet with Earth's characteristics. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 to 5.52 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³. This is roughly the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For planets with the same composition, density is affected by mass due to gravitational compression. A planet with less mass will experience weaker gravity, leading to less compression and therefore a lower overall density than a more massive counterpart. Thus, this planet would be less dense than Earth.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This type of planet is often referred to as a \"super-Earth\". Because it has the same composition as Earth but significantly more mass, its own gravity will compress its material much more intensely. This gravitational compression increases the planet's overall density. Models and observations of rocky super-Earths confirm that as mass increases for a given composition, density also increases. For example, a rocky planet with a mass of 4 Earth masses was found to have a density of 6.9 g/cm³, and another with a mass of about 2.3 Earth masses has a density of 6.67 g/cm³, both denser than Earth. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with an Earth-like composition would be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.52 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) would have a density less than 5.52 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) would have a density significantly greater than 5.52 g/cm³ due to gravitational compression.\n\nComparing these, the planet with 5 Earth masses and the same composition as Earth (c) will have the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
