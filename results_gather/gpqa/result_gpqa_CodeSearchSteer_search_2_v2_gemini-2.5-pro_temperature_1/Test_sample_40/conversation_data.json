    "This problem requires the application of Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary frame of reference (let's call it S).\n    *   The moving glass is the moving frame of reference (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Determine the velocities.**\n    *   The velocity of the moving frame (the glass) relative to the stationary frame (the lab) is *v*.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame (S'), is *u'*. The refractive index *n* is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (*c*) to its speed in the medium (*u'*). Given that the speed of light in a vacuum *c* is set to 1, the speed of light in the glass is *u' = c/n = 1/n*.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v/c²)*\n\n    Here, *u* is the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    *   *u'* = 1/n\n    *   *v* = v\n    *   *c* = 1\n\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1²)*\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)*\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, multiply the numerator and the denominator by *n*:\n\n    *u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)*\n    *u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)*\n\nThis result matches option D. This effect, where the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the speeds, was famously observed in the Fizeau experiment. Einstein later showed that this result is a direct consequence of the theory of special relativity.\n\nThe correct answer is therefore (1+n*v)/(n+v).\n\n<<<D>>>"
