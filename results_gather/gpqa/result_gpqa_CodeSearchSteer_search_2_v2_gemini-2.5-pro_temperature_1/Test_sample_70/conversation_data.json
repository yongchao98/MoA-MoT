    "The user wants the ratio of equilibrium temperatures for two planets. My initial derivation was:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance from the star (`a`).\n    *   T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (`a`). It states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n    *   This can be rearranged to show the relationship for the semi-major axis: a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Combining the Formulas:** By substituting the relationship for `a` from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature relationship, we can find how temperature depends on the orbital period.\n    *   T_eq ∝ (1 / P^(2/3))^(1/2)\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio:** We need the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / P_4^(1/3)) / (1 / P_2^(1/3))\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Plugging in the Values:** The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, we can set P_2 = 2 and P_4 = 3.5.\n    *   Ratio = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    *   Ratio = (0.5714...)^(1/3)\n    *   Ratio ≈ 0.82986\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83. This confirms my initial reasoning. The search results support the physics principles I used. The equilibrium temperature is indeed inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance, and Kepler's Third Law correctly relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis. The problem states the orbits are circular, so the semi-major axis is the orbital distance. It also states the albedos are the same, so that factor cancels out, as do the properties of the parent star.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward. No further information is needed.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand Equilibrium Temperature:** A planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) depends on its distance from its star (`a`). Specifically, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis of its orbit (T_eq ∝ 1/√a).\n\n2.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a³). This can be written as P² ∝ a³, which means the semi-major axis is proportional to the orbital period to the power of 2/3 (a ∝ P²/³).\n\n3.  **Relate Temperature to Period:** By substituting the relationship from Kepler's Law into the temperature formula, we find how temperature relates to the orbital period:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P²/³)\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / P¹/³\n\n4.  **Form the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂/P₄)¹/³\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_1 through Planet_5 as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we have P₂ = 2 and P₄ = 3.5 (in arbitrary units).\n    *   Ratio = (2 / 3.5)¹/³\n    *   Ratio ≈ (0.5714)¹/³\n    *   Ratio ≈ 0.83\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
