    "To solve this problem, we must determine the minimum amount of strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and then find the pH of the resulting 100 cm³ solution.\n\n### Step 1: Stoichiometric Calculation\n\nFirst, let's determine the amount of acid needed based on the reaction stoichiometry. The dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) follows this chemical equation:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   From the stoichiometry, moles of H⁺ = 3 × moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.0028073 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid:**\n    *   The acid is 0.1 M, which means it contains 0.1 moles of H⁺ per liter.\n    *   Volume = moles / concentration = 0.0028073 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028073 L.\n    *   Converting to cm³: 0.028073 L × 1000 cm³/L = 28.073 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is very close to the value in option C (28.05 cm³). This suggests that the \"minimum volume\" refers to the stoichiometric amount needed for the reaction.\n\n### Step 2: pH Calculation\n\nNow, we need to determine the pH of the final solution. After the reaction, the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ has been converted into Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\n1.  **Calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   The number of moles of Fe³⁺ produced is equal to the initial moles of Fe(OH)₃, which is 0.00093575 mol.\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = moles / total volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.0093575 M.\n\n2.  **Consider the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion:**\n    The ferric ion (Fe³⁺) is a small, highly charged metal ion that hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak acid and lowering the pH. The primary hydrolysis reaction is:\n\n    Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n    To find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction. The equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ to Fe(OH)²⁺ and H⁺ is reported to be 6.5 x 10⁻³ at 25°C.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the H⁺ concentration:**\n    *   Reaction: Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n    *   Initial: [Fe³⁺] = 0.0093575 M, [Fe(OH)²⁺] = 0, [H⁺] ≈ 0\n    *   Change: -x, +x, +x\n    *   Equilibrium: 0.0093575 - x, x, x\n\n4.  **Write the Ka expression and solve for x (which represents [H⁺]):**\n    *   Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = (x)(x) / (0.0093575 - x) = 6.5 × 10⁻³\n\n    This is a quadratic equation: x² = 6.5 × 10⁻³ (0.0093575 - x)\n    x² = 6.082 × 10⁻⁵ - 6.5 × 10⁻³ x\n    x² + 0.0065x - 0.00006082 = 0\n\n    Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\n    x = [-0.0065 ± sqrt((0.0065)² - 4(1)(-0.00006082))] / 2(1)\n    x = [-0.0065 ± sqrt(0.00004225 + 0.00024328)] / 2\n    x = [-0.0065 ± sqrt(0.00028553)] / 2\n    x = [-0.0065 ± 0.0169] / 2\n\n    Since concentration (x) must be positive, we take the positive root:\n    x = (-0.0065 + 0.0169) / 2 = 0.0104 / 2 = 0.0052 M.\n    So, [H⁺] ≈ 0.0052 M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final pH:**\n    *   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.0052) ≈ 2.28\n\nThis pH value (2.28) is reasonably close to the pH value in option C (2.04), with discrepancies likely arising from using slightly different Ka values found in literature or making simplifying assumptions. The calculation confirms that the solution will be strongly acidic due to the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated volume of acid (28.07 cm³) and the resulting acidic pH (around 2.28) align best with the values presented in option C.\n\n*   Calculated Volume: 28.07 cm³ (Option C: 28.05 cm³)\n*   Calculated pH: ~2.28 (Option C: 2.04)\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
