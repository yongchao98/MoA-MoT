    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Induced Charges:** The positive charge $+q$ placed inside the cavity will attract free electrons from the conductor. This results in a total charge of $-q$ being induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Charge Neutrality:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall neutrality, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The charges inside the conductor (the original charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface) arrange themselves in such a way that their net electric field in the body of the conductor and everywhere outside the conductor is zero. This means the electric field outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charge on its outer surface.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the shielding effect, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it. Since the conductor is spherical, this outer charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the surface.\n5.  **Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n6.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. The center of the spherical conductor is O. The point P is at a distance $L$ from O. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law as if a point charge $+q$ were at O.\n\nThe resulting formula is:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its location ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all extraneous details designed to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding. The external field depends only on the net charge induced on the outer surface and the shape of the outer surface.\n\n<<<A>>>"
