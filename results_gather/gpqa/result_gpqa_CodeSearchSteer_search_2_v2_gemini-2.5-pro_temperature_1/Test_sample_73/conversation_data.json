    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process governed by exponential decay. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in the future.\n\n### 2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving until time *t* is given by the formula:\n*P(survival)* = e^(-λt)\n\nWhere λ is the decay constant. Consequently, the probability of decay within time *t* is:\n*P(decay)* = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find a value related to the decay constant.\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the survival probability part:\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\n### 3. Calculate the Required Probability\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because the decay process is memoryless, this is equivalent to calculating the decay probability for a fresh atom over a 150-minute period.\n\nThe probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n*P(decay in 150 min)* = 1 - e^(-150λ)\n\nWe can use the value we found in the previous step to solve this. We know that e^(-100λ) = 0.68. We can rewrite e^(-150λ) as:\ne^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the known value:\ne^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's calculate the value of (0.68)^1.5:\n(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, calculate the decay probability:\n*P(decay in 150 min)* = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
