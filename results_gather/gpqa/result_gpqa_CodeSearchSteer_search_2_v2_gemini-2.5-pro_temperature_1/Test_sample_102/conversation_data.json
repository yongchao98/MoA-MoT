    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, it is essential to analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at the 1, 3, and 5 positions, respectively. This means all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed sequences:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Nitration of benzene → Nitrobenzene:** The nitro group is a *meta*-director.\n*   **ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene → Aniline:** The amino group (-NH2) is a strong activator and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline:** This reaction fails. The amino group is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   **i-iv) Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene:** These first four steps simply synthesize benzene from benzene, making the sequence inefficient and illogical. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Bromination of benzene → Bromobenzene:** The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **ii) Nitration of bromobenzene:** This step yields mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (the *para* product) and some 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (the *ortho* product). The desired *meta* relationship between the bromo and nitro groups is not achieved.\n*   **iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene:** This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis option appears to be overly complex and contains redundant or misplaced steps. Let's reconsider the fundamental strategy. A common and effective route for synthesizing compounds with a 1,3,5-substitution pattern involves using a powerful directing group that is later modified or removed.\n\nLet's construct the most plausible high-yield synthesis based on established organic chemistry principles:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is treated with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated using Br2 and a Lewis acid catalyst (FeBr3). The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine atom to position 3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Nitration:** Now, 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring has a *meta*-directing acetyl group at C1 and an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at C3. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In this case of conflicting directing effects, the position *meta* to both existing groups is strongly deactivated. However, nitration at C5 is possible, but this step might result in a mixture of isomers, potentially lowering the yield. A more reliable method is often preferred.\n\nLet's re-examine the options, assuming there may be a flaw in the question's premise or options. Given the standard options, none seem to follow a clean, high-yield pathway. However, if forced to choose the *best* possible sequence among the flawed options, a deeper analysis is required. It's clear that options A, B, and C contain steps that are known to fail under the specified conditions. Option D starts correctly with acylation and then bromination, establishing the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups. The subsequent steps are convoluted and chemically questionable, suggesting an error in the option itself.\n\nBased on a logical synthesis pathway, the sequence would be:\ni) **CH3COCl/AlCl3** (Acylation) → Acetophenone\nii) **Br2/FeBr3** (Bromination) → 3-Bromoacetophenone\niii) **HNO3/H2SO4** (Nitration) → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n\nThis three-step sequence is the most direct route. Since this is not an option, and options A, B, and C have definitive failing steps, option D remains the only possibility, despite its apparent flaws in the later steps. The first two steps of D (Acylation then Bromination) correctly establish the 1,3-disubstituted pattern, which is the most critical part of the synthesis.\n\nFinal evaluation points to a likely error in the provided options. However, if a choice must be made, the one that begins with the most logical steps to set up the required substitution pattern would be the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
