    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, the data from each characterization technique must be analyzed.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids and alcohols. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group. This functional group is present in aldehydes, ketones, esters, and carboxylic acids.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**: The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of an alkene.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry**: A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n### Integration of Data and Structure Determination\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points towards a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an alkene functional group, which is known as an alkenoic acid.\n\n*   The FTIR peaks for a broad O-H (around 3000 cm⁻¹), a C=O (around 1700 cm⁻¹), and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 collectively confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The FTIR peak for a C=C (at 1650 cm⁻¹) and the vinyl hydrogens in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirm the presence of an alkene.\n\n### Evaluating the Chemical Formulas\n\nTo determine the correct molecular formula, we can calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for a molecule with one double bond and one carbonyl group. A double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) also accounts for one. Therefore, the molecule must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nThe formula for the degree of unsaturation is:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens; oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This is consistent with a molecule containing one C=C double bond and one C=O double bond. This fits the description of an alkenoic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While this has the correct DoU, it only has one oxygen atom, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This would correspond to a saturated aldehyde or ketone.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic data is C₆H₁₀O₂, as it has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation for an alkenoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
