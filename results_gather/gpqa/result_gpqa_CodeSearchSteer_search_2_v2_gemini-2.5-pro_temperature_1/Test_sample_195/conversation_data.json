    "The derivation performed in the thought process is a standard approach for this type of problem and appears to be correct. The search results confirm that for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved, and it is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. This is the fundamental principle used in the derivation.\n\nLet's re-state the derivation to ensure clarity.\n1.  **Define the total energy of the system.** The total energy `E` is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy of the spring system. The relativistic energy of a particle with mass `m` and velocity `v` is `γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor `1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. The potential energy `U` for a spring with constant `k` at position `x` is `(1/2)kx²`.\n    So, `E_total = γmc² + (1/2)kx²`.\n\n2.  **Apply the law of conservation of energy.** The total energy of the isolated system must remain constant throughout the oscillation. We will compare the energy at two specific points: the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude `A`) and the equilibrium point (`x=0`).\n\n3.  **Calculate the total energy at maximum displacement (x = A).** At this point, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity `v` is 0.\n    *   When `v = 0`, the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0²/c²) = 1`.\n    *   The relativistic energy is `(1)mc² = mc²`.\n    *   The potential energy is `(1/2)kA²`.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy is `E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total energy at the equilibrium position (x = 0).** At this point, the potential energy is zero, and the mass reaches its maximum speed, `v_max`.\n    *   Let `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n    *   The relativistic energy is `γ_max * mc²`.\n    *   The potential energy is `(1/2)k(0)² = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy is `E_total = γ_max * mc²`.\n\n5.  **Equate the energies and solve for v_max.**\n    `γ_max * mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²`\n\n    First, solve for `γ_max`:\n    `γ_max = (mc² + (1/2)kA²) / mc²`\n    `γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\n    Now, use the definition of `γ_max` to find `v_max`:\n    `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`\n    `γ_max² = 1 / (1 - v_max²/c²)`\n    `1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / γ_max²`\n    `v_max²/c² = 1 - (1 / γ_max²)`\n    `v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ_max²)`\n\n    Finally, substitute the expression for `γ_max`:\n    `v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + kA²/(2mc²))²)`\n\nThis result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
