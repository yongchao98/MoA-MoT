  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "An analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the reason for the lack of protein overexpression. The standard genetic code utilizes specific three-nucleotide codons to signal the termination of translation. These stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA in the DNA coding strand, which correspond to UAA, UAG, and UGA in the messenger RNA (mRNA). When a ribosome encounters one of these codons, translation is terminated, and the polypeptide chain is released.\n\nTo identify the issue, the construct's DNA sequence must be translated into its corresponding amino acid sequence, starting from the initiation codon (ATG).\n\n1.  **Start Codon and HA Tag:** The sequence begins with `ATG`, which correctly codes for Methionine, the typical start of translation. The following codons, `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`, translate to the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. This is the correct sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic tag.\n\n2.  **Premature Stop Codon:** Immediately following the HA tag sequence, the codons are `AAA TGA...`. While `AAA` codes for the amino acid Lysine, the very next codon, `TGA`, is a stop codon (specifically, the \"opal\" or \"umber\" stop codon).\n\n3.  **Consequence:** Because of this premature termination codon (PTC) located just three nucleotides after the HA tag sequence, the ribosome halts protein synthesis almost immediately after it starts. This results in the production of a tiny, non-functional peptide (Met-YPYDVPDYA-Lys) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. This explains why you are unable to detect the overexpression of your target protein.\n\nTherefore, the ribosome terminated the translation prematurely due to an unintended stop codon in the engineered sequence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
