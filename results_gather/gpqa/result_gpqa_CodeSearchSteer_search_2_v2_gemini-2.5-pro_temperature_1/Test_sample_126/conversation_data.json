    "The reaction that occurs when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated is a Cope rearrangement, which is a type of-sigmatropic rearrangement common to 1,5-dienes. This is a concerted, intramolecular process that involves the reorganization of electrons and results in an isomeric product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and the 1,5-Diene System**: The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure is a nine-carbon chain with a butyl group at position 5 and double bonds starting at carbons 2 and 6. This C2-to-C7 fragment (CH=CH-CHâ‚‚-CH-CH=CH) constitutes the required hexa-1,5-diene system for a Cope rearrangement.\n\n2.  **Understand the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism**: In a Cope rearrangement, the sigma bond between carbons 3 and 4 of the 1,5-diene system breaks, while a new sigma bond forms between carbons 1 and 6. Simultaneously, the two pi bonds shift. In this specific molecule, the bond between C4 and C5 of the main chain breaks, and a new bond forms between C2 and C7. The double bonds shift from C2=C3 and C6=C7 to C3=C4 and C5=C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure**:\n    *   The breaking of the C4-C5 bond and the formation of the C2-C7 bond rearrange the carbon skeleton.\n    *   The original methyl group on C2 and the ethyl group on C7 become substituents on the new main chain.\n    *   The original butyl group on C5 remains attached to what becomes part of the new main chain.\n    *   The rearrangement results in a new molecule with two new double bonds.\n\n4.  **Name the Product**: To name the resulting molecule, we must first identify the longest carbon chain that contains both of the new double bonds.\n    *   Tracing the rearranged connectivity reveals a 10-carbon chain (a decadiene).\n    *   Numbering this new chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants places them at positions 1 and 5 (deca-1,5-diene).\n    *   The original methyl group (C1 of the starting material) is now at position 3 of this new chain.\n    *   The original ethyl group (C8 and C9 of the starting material) is now at position 4 of the new chain.\n    *   Following IUPAC nomenclature rules, the substituents are listed alphabetically.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
