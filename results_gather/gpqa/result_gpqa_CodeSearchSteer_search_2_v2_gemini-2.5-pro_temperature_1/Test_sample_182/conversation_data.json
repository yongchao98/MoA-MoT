    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n### 1. The Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which we'll place at carbon 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at carbon 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at carbon 5.\n\nThe molecular formula for this reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) for the reactant can be calculated from its structure:\n*   One ring = 1\n*   One C=C bond in the ring = 1\n*   One C=C bond in the vinyl group = 1\n*   One C=O bond in the formyl group = 1\n*   One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group = 1\n*   **Total IHD for reactant = 5**\n\n### 2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI\n\nRed phosphorus in the presence of excess hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. This reagent is known to reduce a wide variety of functional groups completely down to the corresponding alkane.\n\nSpecifically, for the functional groups present in our reactant:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 will become a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 will become a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nTherefore, the final product is a saturated cycloalkane with three alkyl substituents: 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane (the numbering is based on the reactant for clarity). This is a saturated molecule containing a single ring.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe IHD is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, contains one cyclohexane ring. This accounts for an IHD of 1.\n*   **Pi (π) bonds:** The reduction process eliminates all double bonds (C=C and C=O) that were present in the reactant. The final product is a saturated alkane, meaning it has no double or triple bonds.\n\nThus, the only contribution to the IHD of the product is the single ring structure.\n\n**IHD of product = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1**\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀. We can verify the IHD using the formula IHD = C - H/2 + 1:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
