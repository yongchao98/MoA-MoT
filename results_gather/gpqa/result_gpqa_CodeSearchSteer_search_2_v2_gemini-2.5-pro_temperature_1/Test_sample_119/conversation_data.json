    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Assume a uniform star distribution.** This means the number of stars per unit volume, let's call it ρ, is constant throughout space.\n\n2.  **Consider stars in a thin spherical shell.** Imagine a thin spherical shell at a distance *d* from the Sun with a small thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) is its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (*dd*).\n    *   dV = 4πd² * dd\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in this shell.** With a uniform density ρ, the number of stars (*dN*) in this volume is:\n    *   dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd\n\n4.  **Relate distance (d) to parallax (plx).** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. By definition, a star at a distance of 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond. Therefore, the relationship is:\n    *   d = 1/plx\n\n5.  **Express the change in distance (dd) in terms of the change in parallax (d(plx)).** We can find this by taking the derivative of the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n    *   dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    *   This means dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx). The negative sign simply indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars, we can consider the magnitude, so |dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|.\n\n6.  **Substitute the parallax expressions back into the equation for the number of stars (dN).**\n    *   Start with: dN = 4πρd² * dd\n    *   Substitute d = 1/plx: dN = 4πρ(1/plx)² * dd\n    *   Substitute dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx): dN = 4πρ(1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n    *   Combine the terms: dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.** This is the expression dN/d(plx).\n    *   dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to 1/plx⁴. This relationship is a foundational concept in stellar statistics and is related to the Lutz-Kelker bias, which accounts for observational biases in parallax measurements.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<A>>>"
