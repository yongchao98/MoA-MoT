    "The provided spectral data allows for a clear determination of the unknown compound's structure. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about one-third (32%) is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing a single chlorine atom. The molecular weight of all possible answers is approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with this finding.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows a very broad absorption band in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ region, which is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. Furthermore, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. This combination strongly suggests the presence of a -COOH group, pointing toward either 2-chlorobenzoic acid or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.\n    *   The aromatic region displays a simple pattern of two doublets: one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H). This pattern indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring results in two sets of equivalent protons, which appear as two doublets. 2-chlorobenzoic acid, being ortho-substituted, would produce a more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   Therefore, the NMR data is uniquely consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the combined evidence from Mass Spectrometry (chlorine presence), IR spectroscopy (carboxylic acid functional group), and ¹H NMR (para-substituted aromatic ring), the unknown compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
