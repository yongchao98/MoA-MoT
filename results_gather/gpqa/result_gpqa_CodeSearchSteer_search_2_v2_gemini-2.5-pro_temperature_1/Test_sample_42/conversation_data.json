    "### Breakdown of the IUPAC Naming Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has the highest priority among the given substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano, hydroxyl, dimethylamino, methoxy). Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom to which the carboxylic acid is attached is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   **C1:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Meta positions to C1:** C3 and C5. The problem states that the carbaldehyde (-CHO, formyl group) and cyano (-CN) groups are meta to the carboxylic acid and also meta to each other. This places them at C3 and C5.\n    *   **Para position to C1:** C4. The methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at C4.\n    *   **Ortho positions to C1:** C2 and C6. These are occupied by the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino [-N(CH3)2] groups.\n    *   **Final placement:** The problem states the hydroxyl group is ortho to the cyano group. If we place the cyano group at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This leaves the dimethylamino group to be placed at C2. The carbaldehyde group must then be at C3.\n\n    The resulting structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (Hydroxy)\n\n3.  **Numbering the Benzene Ring:**\n    *   The C1 position is fixed by the principal functional group (-COOH).\n    *   We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (position numbers) to the other substituents.\n    *   Numbering clockwise from C1 gives the locant set: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1 gives the locant set: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   Since both directions result in the same locant set, a tie-breaker rule must be applied. The rule states that if the locant sets are identical, numbering is assigned to give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n4.  **Applying the Alphabetical Tie-Breaker:**\n    *   First, we list the substituents alphabetically:\n        *   **C**yano\n        *   **D**imethylamino\n        *   **F**ormyl\n        *   **H**ydroxy\n        *   **M**ethoxy\n    *   The substituent that comes first alphabetically is \"cyano\".\n    *   In the clockwise numbering scheme, the cyano group is at C5.\n    *   In the counter-clockwise numbering scheme, the cyano group is at C3.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the counter-clockwise numbering is correct.\n\n5.  **Final Numbering and Name Assembly:**\n    *   The correct numbering based on the IUPAC rules is:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (Hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (Cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (Formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n    *   To construct the final name, list the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its position number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n    *   The correct name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
