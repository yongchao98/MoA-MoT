    "An N-sided regular polygon with an apothem of length 'a' will approach the shape of a circle with radius 'a' as the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large. Therefore, this problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima is given by:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = (m * λ) / d\nwhere for a circular aperture, the relationship involves specific numerical factors derived from the zeros of the Bessel function. The angular position θ for the minima is more accurately given by:\nsin(θ_m) = z_m / (k * a) = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nHere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   k = 2π/λ is the wave number.\n*   z_m is the m-th zero of the J₁ Bessel function.\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ), the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\nθ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of the J₁(x) Bessel function. These are approximately:\n*   First zero (z₁): 3.8317\n*   Second zero (z₂): 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):\n    θ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 λ / a\n\n*   Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):\n    θ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 λ / a\n\nThe angular distance (Δθ) between these two minima is:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.1166 λ / a) - (0.6098 λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.5068 λ / a\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<A>>>"
