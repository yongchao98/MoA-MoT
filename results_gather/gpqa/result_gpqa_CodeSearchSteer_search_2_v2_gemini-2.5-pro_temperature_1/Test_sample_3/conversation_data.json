    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) could exist, two of Maxwell's four fundamental equations of electromagnetism would need to be modified. These equations are Gauss's Law for Magnetism and Faraday's Law of Induction.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the changes:\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field):** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (**B**) is zero (∇ · **B** = 0). This is the mathematical expression of the fact that magnetic field lines are always closed loops and that magnetic monopoles have never been observed. If magnetic monopoles did exist, they would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, much like electric charges do for the electric field. The law would have to be changed to say that the divergence of **B** is proportional to the density of magnetic charge (ρₘ), resulting in a non-zero value.\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t). This is the principle behind electric generators and transformers. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a moving monopole would constitute a \"magnetic current.\" To maintain the symmetry of Maxwell's equations, this magnetic current would have to induce a circulating electric field, similar to how an electric current induces a magnetic field. Therefore, a new term representing this magnetic current would need to be added to Faraday's Law.\n\nThe other two equations, Gauss's Law for electricity (related to the flux/divergence of the electric field) and the Ampère-Maxwell Law (related to the circulation of the magnetic field), would remain unchanged. Therefore, the correct option identifies the two laws that would be modified.\n\n<<<D>>>"
