    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which planet has a higher transit probability.\n\n### 1. Transit Probability Formula\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is primarily determined by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis), especially for circular orbits. The formula is:\n\n*   *p* = *R*<sub>star</sub> / *a*\n\nWhere:\n*   *p* is the transit probability\n*   *R*<sub>star</sub> is the radius of the host star\n*   *a* is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law\nTo find the semi-major axis (*a*), we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (*P*) and the semi-major axis to the mass of the host star (*M*<sub>star</sub>). The law can be expressed as:\n\n*   *P*² ∝ *a*³ / *M*<sub>star</sub>\n\nBy rearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis (*a*), we get:\n\n*   *a* ∝ (*M*<sub>star</sub> * *P*²)<sup>1/3</sup>\n\n### 3. Combining the Formulas\nBy substituting the expression for the semi-major axis (*a*) into the transit probability formula, we can see how the probability (*p*) depends on the stellar mass, stellar radius, and the planet's orbital period:\n\n*   *p* ∝ *R*<sub>star</sub> / (*M*<sub>star</sub> * *P*²)<sup>1/3</sup>\n\n### 4. Applying the Information to Each Planet\n\nLet's define the properties of Planet_2 and its host star as the baseline:\n*   Orbital Period of Planet_2: *P*<sub>2</sub>\n*   Mass of Host Star 2: *M*<sub>2</sub>\n*   Radius of Host Star 2: *R*<sub>2</sub>\n\nNow, let's express the properties of Planet_1 and its host star based on the given information:\n*   **Orbital Periods:** The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2.\n    *   *P*<sub>1</sub> = *P*<sub>2</sub> / 3\n*   **Host Star Masses:** The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2.\n    *   *M*<sub>1</sub> = 2 * *M*<sub>2</sub>\n*   **Host Star Radii:** Both host stars have the same radius.\n    *   *R*<sub>1</sub> = *R*<sub>2</sub>\n\n### 5. Calculating the Ratio of Transit Probabilities\n\nNow we can set up a ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (*p*<sub>1</sub>) to that of Planet_2 (*p*<sub>2</sub>):\n\n*   *p*<sub>1</sub> / *p*<sub>2</sub> = [ *R*<sub>1</sub> / (*M*<sub>1</sub> * *P*<sub>1</sub>²)<sup>1/3</sup> ] / [ *R*<sub>2</sub> / (*M*<sub>2</sub> * *P*<sub>2</sub>²)<sup>1/3</sup> ]\n\nSubstitute the known relationships:\n\n*   *p*<sub>1</sub> / *p*<sub>2</sub> = [ *R*<sub>2</sub> / ( (2 * *M*<sub>2</sub>) * (*P*<sub>2</sub> / 3)² )<sup>1/3</sup> ] / [ *R*<sub>2</sub> / (*M*<sub>2</sub> * *P*<sub>2</sub>²)<sup>1/3</sup> ]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n*   *p*<sub>1</sub> / *p*<sub>2</sub> = [ 1 / ( (2 * *M*<sub>2</sub>) * (*P*<sub>2</sub>² / 9) )<sup>1/3</sup> ] / [ 1 / (*M*<sub>2</sub> * *P*<sub>2</sub>²)<sup>1/3</sup> ]\n*   *p*<sub>1</sub> / *p*<sub>2</sub> = (*M*<sub>2</sub> * *P*<sub>2</sub>²)<sup>1/3</sup> / ( (2/9) * *M*<sub>2</sub> * *P*<sub>2</sub>² )<sup>1/3</sup>\n\nThe terms *M*<sub>2</sub> and *P*<sub>2</sub>² cancel out:\n\n*   *p*<sub>1</sub> / *p*<sub>2</sub> = (1 / (2/9))<sup>1/3</sup>\n*   *p*<sub>1</sub> / *p*<sub>2</sub> = (9 / 2)<sup>1/3</sup>\n*   *p*<sub>1</sub> / *p*<sub>2</sub> = (4.5)<sup>1/3</sup>\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5:\n\n*   *p*<sub>1</sub> / *p*<sub>2</sub> ≈ 1.65\n\n### Conclusion\nThe transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
