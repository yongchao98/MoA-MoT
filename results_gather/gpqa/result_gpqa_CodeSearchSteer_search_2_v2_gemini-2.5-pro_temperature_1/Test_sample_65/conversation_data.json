    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are built from the Standard Model fields and must respect certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry:** SMEFT is a quantum field theory designed to be consistent with the principles of special relativity. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be invariant under Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and, more generally, Poincare transformations, which also include spacetime translations. A violation of CPT symmetry would also imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** CPT (Charge, Parity, Time) symmetry is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theory which states that any local, unitary, and Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT-invariant. Since SMEFT adheres to these principles, all its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge, Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model. SMEFT provides a framework to parameterize not only the Standard Model's CP violation but also potential new sources of CP violation from physics beyond the Standard Model. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry and can be classified as CP-even or CP-odd.\n\nBased on these principles, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
