    "Answering this question requires a deep understanding of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, including the directing effects of various substituents, the use of blocking groups, and functional group interconversions. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a polysubstituted benzene with a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The ethoxy (-OEt) group is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   The tert-butyl (-tBu) group is an activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, sterically hindering adjacent positions.\n*   The nitro (-NO2) group is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern, which is often challenging to achieve directly due to conflicting directing effects.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These sequences contain fundamental flaws.\n    *   **Option C** fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline (from step ii) is not effective. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group to form a positively charged anilinium-type complex, which strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the reaction.\n    *   **Option B** fails at step (iv). It attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (NaNO₂/HCl) on 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂), which is not present at this stage.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is chemically logical, but it produces the wrong isomer.\n    1.  **Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **tert-Butylbenzene → p-tert-Butylnitrobenzene:** Nitration. The para product is major due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group.\n    3.  **p-tert-Butylnitrobenzene → p-tert-Butylaniline:** Reduction of the nitro group.\n    4.  **p-tert-Butylaniline → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitroaniline:** Nitration. The amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. Both the -tBu (o,p) and -NH₃⁺ (m) groups direct nitration to the position ortho to the t-butyl group.\n    5.  **Diazotization →** Converts the -NH₂ group into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    6.  **Hydrolysis (H₃O⁺/Heat) →** Replaces the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to give 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.\n    7.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) →** Converts the -OH group to an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n    The final product of this sequence is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. This is the 1,2,4-isomer, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is the most complex and contains a step that appears chemically incorrect as written, but it is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze its strategy.\n    1.  **Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts.\n    2.  **tert-Butylbenzene → p-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** Sulfonation. The -SO₃H group acts as a blocking group, occupying the para position which is sterically favored for substitution.\n    3.  **Nitration → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** With the para position blocked, nitration is directed by the o,p-directing t-butyl group to the open ortho position.\n    4.  **Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine.\n    5.  **Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) →** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    \n    At this point, we have established a 1,2,4 relationship between the t-butyl, diazonium, and sulfonic acid groups. The subsequent steps (vi-ix) must transform this into the final 1,2,3 product. Step (vi), nitration of a heavily deactivated diazonium salt, is highly problematic and likely a typo. However, the overall strategy involving blocking the para position, introducing groups ortho, and then using a series of transformations (reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, desulfonation, etherification) is a powerful and necessary approach for synthesizing highly substituted, sterically hindered molecules like the target. By eliminating options B, C, and D based on more definitive flaws (failed reaction or wrong product), option A remains the only plausible, albeit imperfect, choice. It is the only sequence that attempts the kind of complex maneuvering required for such a synthesis.\n\nTherefore, despite a likely error in the description of step (vi), the overall synthetic plan outlined in Option A is the most likely to be the intended correct answer for achieving the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
