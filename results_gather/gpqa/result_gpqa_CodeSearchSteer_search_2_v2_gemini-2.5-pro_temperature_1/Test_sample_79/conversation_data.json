    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the algorithm puzzle:\n\n### 1. Define the Algorithm\n\nThe problem provides a function that maps a sequence of letters (A, C, G, T) to a numerical value. Let's denote the value of each letter as V(L), where L can be A, C, G, or T. The output for a sequence is the sum of the values of its letters.\n\nThe given examples are:\n1.  `AGG` -> `V(A) + V(G) + V(G)` = `V(A) + 2*V(G) = 115`\n2.  `TGCTGA` -> `V(T) + V(G) + V(C) + V(T) + V(G) + V(A)` = `V(A) + V(C) + 2*V(G) + 2*V(T) = 176`\n\nWe need to find the value for `ACAGTGACC`.\n\n### 2. Formulate a System of Equations\n\nFrom the examples, we can establish a system of two linear equations with four variables:\n\n*   Equation 1: `V(A) + 2*V(G) = 115`\n*   Equation 2: `V(A) + V(C) + 2*V(G) + 2*V(T) = 176`\n\n### 3. Simplify the System\n\nWe can simplify the system by substituting Equation 1 into Equation 2.\nNotice that the term `V(A) + 2*V(G)` from Equation 1 also appears in Equation 2.\n\nSubstitute `115` for `V(A) + 2*V(G)` in Equation 2:\n`115 + V(C) + 2*V(T) = 176`\n\nNow, solve for `V(C) + 2*V(T)`:\n`V(C) + 2*V(T) = 176 - 115`\n`V(C) + 2*V(T) = 61`\n\nWe now have a simplified system:\n1.  `V(A) + 2*V(G) = 115`\n2.  `V(C) + 2*V(T) = 61`\n\nThis is a system of two equations with four unknowns, which means we cannot find a unique solution without more information. However, this type of puzzle often has a unique integer solution that can be deduced or reverse-engineered from the multiple-choice options.\n\n### 4. Work Backwards from the Options\n\nLet's calculate the formula for the target sequence `ACAGTGACC`.\nThe sequence has:\n*   3 instances of A\n*   3 instances of C\n*   2 instances of G\n*   1 instance of T\n\nSo, the target value is `3*V(A) + 3*V(C) + 2*V(G) + V(T)`.\n\nLet's test the option **C) 333**. Assume the target value is 333:\n`3*V(A) + 3*V(C) + 2*V(G) + V(T) = 333`\n\nNow we have a system of three equations:\n1.  `V(A) = 115 - 2*V(G)`\n2.  `V(C) = 61 - 2*V(T)`\n3.  `3*V(A) + 3*V(C) + 2*V(G) + V(T) = 333`\n\nSubstitute the first two equations into the third:\n`3*(115 - 2*V(G)) + 3*(61 - 2*V(T)) + 2*V(G) + V(T) = 333`\n`345 - 6*V(G) + 183 - 6*V(T) + 2*V(G) + V(T) = 333`\n`528 - 4*V(G) - 5*V(T) = 333`\n`4*V(G) + 5*V(T) = 528 - 333`\n`4*V(G) + 5*V(T) = 195`\n\nWe need to find positive integer solutions for `V(G)` and `V(T)`. Since the right side (195) is a multiple of 5, `4*V(G)` must also be a multiple of 5. As 4 and 5 are coprime, `V(G)` must be a multiple of 5. Let's test some values for `V(G)`:\n\n*   If `V(G) = 25`, then `4*25 + 5*V(T) = 195` -> `100 + 5*V(T) = 195` -> `5*V(T) = 95` -> `V(T) = 19`.\n\nThis gives us a potential integer solution: `V(G) = 25` and `V(T) = 19`.\n\n### 5. Find the Remaining Values and Verify\n\nNow we can find `V(A)` and `V(C)`:\n*   `V(A) = 115 - 2*V(G) = 115 - 2*25 = 115 - 50 = 65`\n*   `V(C) = 61 - 2*V(T) = 61 - 2*19 = 61 - 38 = 23`\n\nSo the complete set of values is: `V(A)=65`, `V(C)=23`, `V(G)=25`, `V(T)=19`.\n\nLet's verify these values with the original examples:\n*   `AGG`: `65 + 2*25 = 65 + 50 = 115`. (Correct)\n*   `TGCTGA`: `65 + 23 + 2*25 + 2*19 = 65 + 23 + 50 + 38 = 176`. (Correct)\n\nThe values are consistent with the examples.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Final Answer\n\nNow we calculate the value for `ACAGTGACC` using these derived values:\nValue = `3*V(A) + 3*V(C) + 2*V(G) + V(T)`\nValue = `3*65 + 3*23 + 2*25 + 1*19`\nValue = `195 + 69 + 50 + 19`\nValue = `264 + 69`\nValue = `333`\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
