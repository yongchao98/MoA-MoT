    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of acid and base being mixed.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   **CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        Moles = Volume × Molarity = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 moles\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):**\n        Moles of H+ = Volume × Molarity = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 moles\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n        Ba(OH)2 dissociates to produce two OH- ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n        Moles of OH- = Volume × Molarity × 2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.180 moles\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    The strong base (OH-) will first neutralize the strong acid (H+ from HCl) because this reaction goes to completion.\n    *   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   After reaction, the H+ is completely consumed, and the remaining moles of OH- are: 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 moles of OH-.\n\n    Next, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Remaining moles OH- = 0.100 mol\n    *   The weak acid is completely consumed, and the excess moles of OH- are: 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 moles of OH-.\n\n3.  **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- ions from the strong base. The presence of this strong base will dominate the pH, making the contribution from the weak conjugate base (CH3COO-) negligible.\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Final [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   Final [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   First, calculate the pOH:\n        pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   Then, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n        pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
