    "To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Determine the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC):**\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. For the purpose of this calculation, we can use a rounded value of 160,000 light-years, which is also a commonly cited distance.\n\n**2. Calculate the time of the journey from an Earth-based observer's perspective (t):**\nThe spacecraft travels at a speed (v) of 0.99999987 times the speed of light (c). The time it would take from Earth's frame of reference is the distance divided by the speed.\nt = Distance / v\nt = 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987c ≈ 160,000 years\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is a key component in time dilation calculations and is determined by the spacecraft's velocity. The formula is:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven v = 0.99999987c, v/c = 0.99999987.\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987)²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\nγ = 1 / √0.00000026\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.17\n\n**4. Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (t'):**\nTime dilation causes time to pass slower for the moving astronaut relative to a stationary observer on Earth. The time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time) is calculated by dividing the time measured from Earth by the Lorentz factor.\nt' = t / γ\nt' = 160,000 years / 1961.17\nt' ≈ 81.58 years\n\n**5. Determine if the astronaut survives:**\nThe astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifespan of 150 years, leaving them 128 years of life. Since the journey takes approximately 81.6 years from their perspective, which is less than their remaining lifespan, the astronaut will survive the trip.\n\nBased on the calculation, the journey will take approximately 81.6 years for the astronaut. This value is closest to 81 years.\n\n<<<C>>>"
