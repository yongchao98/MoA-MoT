    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid**\n\nThis is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group. The reaction yields a mixture of *ortho*-nitrotoluene and *para*-nitrotoluene, with the *para* isomer being the major product due to less steric hindrance. We will assume the reaction proceeds with the major product.\n\n*   **Product 1:** *p*-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 treated with MnO2 and H2SO4**\n\nThis step involves the oxidation of product 1 (*p*-nitrotoluene). The reagents MnO2 and H2SO4 are oxidizing agents. While strong oxidizing agents typically convert the methyl group of toluene derivatives to a carboxylic acid, using MnO2 can allow for a more controlled oxidation to the aldehyde. In the context of the subsequent reaction, formation of an aldehyde is the most logical pathway. A patent describes a process for producing anisaldehyde that involves the oxidation of *p*-methoxytoluene with manganese dioxide and sulfuric acid, and another process involving the oxidation of *p*-nitrotoluene to the aldehyde.\n\n*   **Product 2:** *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde)\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide**\n\nThis is a base-catalyzed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, between an aldehyde (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone (acetone). The sodium hydroxide acts as a base to remove an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone, forming an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting β-hydroxy ketone readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The final product is known as *p*-nitrobenzalacetone.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we must analyze the symmetry elements of the final product, 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a *para*-substituted benzene ring connected to a butenone chain (-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3).\n*   **Planarity:** Due to the extensive sp2 hybridization and conjugation across the benzene ring, the double bond, and the carbonyl group, the main framework of the molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** Present in all molecules.\n    *   **Rotation Axis (Cn):** There are no rotation axes (other than the trivial C1). Rotating the molecule 180 degrees about any axis will not result in an identical structure.\n    *   **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n    *   **Mirror Plane (σ):** Because the main framework of the molecule is planar, the plane containing these atoms acts as a mirror plane of symmetry. Any point above the plane is reflected to a corresponding point below the plane. This is the only symmetry element present other than the identity.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs.\n\n<<<D>>>"
