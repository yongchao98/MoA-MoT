    "All four of the listed issues are known to cause problems in genomics data analysis. However, three of them are particularly notorious for generating erroneous results that can be difficult to spot.\n\n*   **The \"chr\" / \"no chr\" confusion:** Inconsistencies in chromosome naming, where some files use a \"chr\" prefix (e.g., \"chr1\") and others do not (e.g., \"1\"), are a prevalent source of hard-to-detect errors. This is because different bioinformatics tools and reference genome providers, like UCSC and Ensembl, use different conventions. This can lead to data being silently dropped or misinterpreted during analysis, rather than causing an obvious error.\n*   **Reference assembly mismatch:** Using different versions of the reference genome (e.g., GRCh37/hg19 versus GRCh38/hg38) for different datasets or steps in a pipeline is a common source of subtle errors. This can result in misaligned reads, incorrect variant calls, and misleading annotations because the genomic coordinates do not correspond to the same location across assemblies.\n*   **Incorrect ID conversion:** The conversion of gene and variant identifiers is another frequent cause of hidden errors. A classic and persistent example is spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel auto-converting gene symbols, such as SEPT2 (September 2) or DEC1 (December 1), into dates. This problem can lead to the irreversible loss of data and has been found to contaminate supplementary files in a significant percentage of published articles.\n\nWhile mutually incompatible data formats can certainly cause errors, these often result in a tool or pipeline failing to run, which is a more obvious problem. The other three issues, however, can allow an analysis to run to completion but produce scientifically invalid results that are much harder to detect.\n\nTherefore, the \"chr\" / \"no chr\" confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion are all considered common and difficult-to-spot sources of error.\n\n<<<D>>>"
