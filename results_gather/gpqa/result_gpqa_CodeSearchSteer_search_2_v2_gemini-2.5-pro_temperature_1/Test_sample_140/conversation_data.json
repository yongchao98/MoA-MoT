    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. To determine the number of possible organic products, one must consider all possible reaction pathways.\n\nThe reaction involves two main stages: elimination to form a reactive benzyne intermediate, and then addition of an amine group to that intermediate.\n\n**1. Elimination Step: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide (NH₂⁻), abstracts an acidic proton from the position adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such adjacent positions:\n*   **Pathway A:** Abstraction of a hydrogen atom (H) from the C6 position.\n*   **Pathway B:** Abstraction of a deuterium atom (D) from the C2 position.\n\nAlthough the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond, meaning Pathway A is kinetically favored, both pathways are possible and lead to different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **From Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Removal of H from C6 and subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 results in a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at the C2 position. This creates **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **From Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of D from C2 and subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 results in a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium has been removed, forming a **non-deuterated benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**2. Addition Step: Formation of Final Products**\n\nThe nucleophilic amide ion (or ammonia solvent) then attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne:** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The amide can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond:\n    1.  Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Attack on non-deuterated benzyne:** This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by the amide ion leads to a single product: **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, combining the outcomes of both possible initial elimination steps, there are three distinct possible organic products.\n\nThe three possible organic products are:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-Deuteroaniline\n*   3-Deuteroaniline\n\nThus, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
