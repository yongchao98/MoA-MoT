    "The chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2. This is determined by systematically breaking down the information provided by the spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core structure is therefore a C₆H₄ group.\n\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring contains 4 aromatic protons. The presence of two distinct signals suggests a specific substitution pattern, such as para-substitution, which would give two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a simple doublet. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **Two –CH₃ signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester, indicating either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃). Both of these ester-containing fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** This confirms the absence of ethyl or other methylene-containing fragments.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula:\n\nBy combining the identified fragments, the total molecular formula can be calculated:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Ester/Methyl Group:** C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming the atoms from each fragment:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThus, the final chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches possible structures like methyl 4-propenylbenzoate or 4-propenylphenyl acetate, both of which are consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
