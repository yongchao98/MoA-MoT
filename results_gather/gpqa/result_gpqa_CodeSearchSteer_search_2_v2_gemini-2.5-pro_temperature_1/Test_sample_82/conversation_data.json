    "This is a stoichiometry and acid-base equilibrium problem that can be solved with chemical principles. No external search is needed.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\n*   First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   Next, calculate the new concentration after diluting with 20.00 cm³ (0.02000 L) of water:\n    *   New Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n    *   New Molarity = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer:\n    *   pH = pKa + log ( [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] )\n*   First, calculate the pKa:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base to acid is 25% to 75%:\n    *   Ratio = [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    *   pH = 4.25\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   First, determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point, where moles of acid equal moles of base.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = (Moles of CH₃COOH) / (Molarity of NaOH)\n    *   Volume of NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The total volume is the initial acid volume plus the added NaOH volume.\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion at this point:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   To find the concentration of OH⁻, we need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02 M.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) = 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26 (rounding 4.25 up), and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<A>>>"
