    "To solve this problem, we must first deduce the structure of the molecule based on the information provided and then determine which of the given ¹H NMR spectra corresponds to that structure.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆).\n*   **Total Carbons:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the substituents must contain the remaining 2 carbons.\n*   **Di-substituted:** There are two groups attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present, meaning a halogen (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the two substituents are a halogen atom (-X) and a group containing a carbonyl and a methyl group. The most plausible structure for this second substituent is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the ¹H NMR Data\n\nNow we need to analyze the provided ¹H NMR options to see which one matches the structure of a haloacetophenone. A key feature of the ¹H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted benzene ring is the pattern of the aromatic protons (in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range). The substitution can be *ortho*, *meta*, or *para*.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not the methyl ketone we deduced. This spectrum would better fit a halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The integration of the aromatic region is only 1H, which is incorrect for a di-substituted benzene ring (it should have 4 aromatic protons).\n\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (> 6.5 ppm), so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a **para (1,4) substituted** benzene ring. This symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are shifted further downfield (deshielded) compared to the protons ortho to the halogen.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The signal at **2.3 ppm** is a singlet integrating to 3 protons. This is the exact expected chemical shift and multiplicity for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ¹H NMR data in option D perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a **p-haloacetophenone**. For instance, the spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows a singlet for the methyl group around 2.6 ppm and two doublets for the aromatic protons at approximately 7.45 ppm and 7.91 ppm. Similarly, 4-bromoacetophenone shows the methyl singlet at 2.60 ppm and aromatic signals at 7.62 and 7.83 ppm. The values in option D are well within the expected range for this class of compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
