    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2.\n\n### Understanding the Notation\n\nIn astronomy, the abundance of elements is often expressed using a bracket notation, which compares a star's elemental ratios to those of the Sun. The notation `[X/Y]` is defined as:\n\n`[X/Y] = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun`\n\nwhere `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities of elements X and Y, respectively. A very useful identity derived from this definition is:\n\n`[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]`\n\nHere, `H` represents hydrogen, the most common element, which serves as the standard reference.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Star 1\n\nWe are given the following information for Star 1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex`\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex`\n\nWe want to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]_1`. We can use the identity `[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1`.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n`0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0`\n\nThis directly gives us the silicon abundance for Star 1:\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3`\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Star 2\n\nFor Star 2, we have:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex`\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex`\n\nSimilarly, we want to find `[Si/H]_2`. We use the identity `[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`.\n\nSubstituting the values for Star 2:\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`\n\nSolving for `[Si/H]_2`, we get:\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Abundances\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. In this context, this refers to the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen, which is `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\nFrom the definition of `[X/H]`:\n`[Si/H] = log10(nSi/nH)_star - log10(nSi/nH)_sun`\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the abundance in the star:\n`log10(nSi/nH)_star = [Si/H] + log10(nSi/nH)_sun`\n\nLet's write this for each star:\n*   For Star 1: `log10(nSi/nH)_1 = [Si/H]_1 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun = 0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun`\n*   For Star 2: `log10(nSi/nH)_2 = [Si/H]_2 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun = -0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun`\n\nTo find the ratio `R = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`, we can use the properties of logarithms:\n`log10(R) = log10((nSi/nH)_1) - log10((nSi/nH)_2)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from above:\n`log10(R) = (0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun) - (-0.3 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun)`\n`log10(R) = 0.3 - (-0.3)`\n`log10(R) = 0.6`\n\nTo find the ratio `R`, we take the antilogarithm:\n`R = 10^0.6`\n`R â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The information regarding the stellar masses, the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Equivalent Width (EW) method, and the specific solar abundances for iron and magnesium are contextual details about how such values are determined but are not required for this specific calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
