    "To find the numerical value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding a particle somewhere in space must be equal to 1. The probability is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function, |ψ(x)|².\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\n**1. Calculate the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²**\n\nFirst, we find the complex conjugate, ψ*(x), by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNext, we calculate the probability density, |ψ(x)|², by multiplying the wave function by its complex conjugate:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)\n|ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / √(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ] * [ ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ]\nUsing the difference of squares formula, (A+B)(A-B) = A² - B², we get:\n|ψ(x)|² = ( a / √(1 + x) )² - (0.5i)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - 0.25 * i²\nSince i² = -1:\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**2. Apply the Normalization Condition**\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be 1.\n\n∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n**3. Solve the Integral**\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nFor the first part, we integrate a²/(1+x). The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\na² * [ln(1 + x)] (from 1 to 3) = a² * [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)] = a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)]\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\nFor the second part, we integrate the constant 0.25:\n[0.25 * x] (from 1 to 3) = 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\n**4. Solve for \"a\"**\n\nNow, we set the sum of the solved integrals equal to 1:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2 (ln(2) ≈ 0.693):\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\na ≈ √0.7215\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
