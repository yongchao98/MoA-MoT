    "The chemical synthesis proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine:** This is an alpha-halogenation of a ketone, which forms 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone, an α-halo ketone, undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement in the presence of a strong base like NaOH. This reaction involves a ring contraction, yielding cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2).\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) to form cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3). This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride.\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. Therefore, it reduces cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride to cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Product 4).\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring with a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached. The carbon atom of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: the aldehyde group, a hydrogen atom, and two different paths around the ring (C2 and C5).\n\nBecause the molecule contains a chiral center, it lacks any plane of symmetry. In a molecule with no symmetry, all hydrogens that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation or rapid conformational changes are chemically distinct. Let's count them:\n\n*   **The aldehyde hydrogen (H-C=O):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1)\n*   **The hydrogen on C1:** This methine hydrogen is attached to the chiral center and is unique. (1)\n*   **The hydrogens on C2 and C5 (alpha-protons):** The two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center. Similarly, the two hydrogens on C5 are diastereotopic. Furthermore, the C2 position and the C5 position are diastereotopic to each other. Thus, all four of these alpha-protons are chemically distinct. (4)\n*   **The hydrogens on C3 and C4 (beta-protons):** Due to the chirality at C1, the protons on C3 are also in a different chemical environment than those on C4. It is often assumed in introductory problems that the effect of a distant chiral center might become negligible, causing accidental equivalence. If we assume the four beta-protons become accidentally equivalent due to their distance from the chiral center, they would produce a single signal. (1)\n\nFollowing this reasoning, the total number of chemically distinct sets of hydrogens is 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 4 (alpha-protons) + 1 (beta-protons) = 7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
