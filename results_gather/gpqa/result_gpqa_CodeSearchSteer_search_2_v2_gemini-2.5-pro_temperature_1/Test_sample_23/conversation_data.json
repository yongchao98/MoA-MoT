    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon is either CnH2n+2 (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n    *   Let's check the mass percentage of hydrogen for a cycloalkane (CnH2n). The molar mass is approximately 12n + 2n = 14n. The mass of hydrogen is 2n.\n    *   Mass % H = (2n / 14n) * 100% = (1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.286%. This matches the given value.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The information that Z does not react further with hydrogen confirms it is saturated.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixtures**\n    *   Mixture X contains two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds (unsaturation). The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by treating X with platinum at high temperature. This reaction is called a disproportionation.\n    *   Mixture Y contains two liquids that do *not* decolorize bromine water. This means they are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a component of mixture Y. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n), the other component of Y must be the \"oxidized\" product of the disproportionation. For it to not decolorize bromine water, it is most likely an aromatic compound.\n    *   The most plausible reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer between an unsaturated cyclic compound (cycloalkene) and a more unsaturated one (cycloalkadiene) to produce a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\n    *   The reaction scheme is: **Cycloalkene + Cycloalkadiene → Cycloalkane + Aromatic Compound**\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry. If all compounds are based on the same C-number 'n':\n        CnH2n-2 (cycloalkene) + CnH2n-4 (cycloalkadiene) → CnH2n (cycloalkane) + CnH2n-6 (aromatic)\n        The total atoms on both sides are C2nH4n-6, so the reaction is balanced. Since the reactants are in a 1:1 ratio, the products (mixture Y) will be an equimolar mixture, as stated in the problem.\n\n3.  **Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z.\n    *   Let's test the C6 system.\n        *   Assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. It is a widely used solvent.\n        *   Mixture Y would then be {**cyclohexane (C6H12)**, **benzene (C6H6)**}. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water. Z is a component of Y. This fits.\n        *   Mixture X would be {**cyclohexene (C6H10)**, **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**}. The 1,4-diene is non-conjugated. Both decolorize bromine water. This fits.\n        *   Let's check hydrogenation:\n            *   Hydrogenation of X = {C6H10, C6H8} yields only cyclohexane.\n            *   Hydrogenation of Y = {C6H12, C6H6} yields only cyclohexane (since benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane).\n        *   This C6-based scenario fits all the conditions of the problem.\n\n4.  **Consider Other Possibilities**\n    *   Let's test the C7 system as a check.\n        *   Assume Z is **methylcyclohexane (C7H14)**. It is also a solvent.\n        *   Mixture Y would be {**methylcyclohexane (C7H14)**, **toluene (C7H8)**}. This fits.\n        *   Mixture X would be {**methylcyclohexene (C7H12)**, a non-conjugated **methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10)**}. This fits.\n        *   Hydrogenation of both X and Y in this case would lead to only methylcyclohexane.\n    *   Both the C6 and C7 systems seem chemically plausible. However, the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and common example of this type of chemistry. In the context of such problems, the simplest, unsubstituted ring system is typically the intended answer. Thus, we proceed with the C6 system.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   Based on our deduction, mixture X consists of two liquids:\n        1.  Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        2.  Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of each).\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
