    "To determine the angle between the directions of the two photons produced in the electron-positron annihilation, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from the theory of special relativity.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\nFirst, we calculate the total initial energy of the system, which is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\n*   Energy of the electron (E_e):\n    Given the Lorentz factor for the electron (γ_e) is 4 and its rest mass is m_e.\n    E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 m_e c²\n\n*   Energy of the positron (E_p):\n    Given the Lorentz factor for the positron (γ_p) is 2 and its rest mass is also m_e.\n    E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 m_e c²\n\n*   Total initial energy (E_initial):\n    E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² = 6 m_e c²\n\nAfter annihilation, this total energy is converted into the energy of the two photons (E_final). The problem states that the two photons have the same energy (E_γ).\n\n*   Total final energy (E_final):\n    E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2 E_γ\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final.\n6 m_e c² = 2 E_γ\nTherefore, the energy of each photon is:\nE_γ = 3 m_e c²\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\nNext, we apply the law of conservation of momentum. Momentum is a vector quantity, so we must consider its components along the horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) directions.\n\n*   Initial Momentum (p_initial):\n    The momentum of a relativistic particle can be calculated using the energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². This gives p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) / c.\n\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e):\n        p_e = sqrt((4 m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)²) / c = sqrt(16(m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)²) / c = sqrt(15) m_e c. It moves from left to right, so its momentum is in the positive x-direction.\n\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p):\n        p_p = sqrt((2 m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)²) / c = sqrt(4(m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)²) / c = sqrt(3) m_e c. It moves from right to left, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction.\n\n    *   Total initial momentum in the x-direction (p_initial_x):\n        p_initial_x = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c\n\n    Since both particles move along the horizontal axis, the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n\n*   Final Momentum (p_final):\n    For a photon, the relationship between energy and momentum is E = pc.\n    The momentum of each photon (p_γ) is p_γ = E_γ / c = (3 m_e c²) / c = 3 m_e c.\n\n    The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Due to the symmetry required by the conservation of momentum in the y-direction (initial y-momentum is zero), the angles the photons make with the horizontal axis must be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. Let's call these angles θ and -θ.\n\n    *   Total final momentum in the x-direction (p_final_x):\n        p_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos(θ) = 6 m_e c * cos(θ)\n\n**3. Calculating the Angle**\nBy equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\np_initial_x = p_final_x\n(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c = 6 m_e c * cos(θ)\n\nWe can simplify the equation to find cos(θ):\ncos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n\nUsing the approximate values for the square roots (sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873 and sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732):\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n\nNow, we find the angle θ:\nθ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees\n\nThe question asks for the angle between the two photons, which is 2θ.\nAngle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1 = 138.2 degrees\n\nThis value is very close to 138 degrees.\n\n<<<C>>>"
