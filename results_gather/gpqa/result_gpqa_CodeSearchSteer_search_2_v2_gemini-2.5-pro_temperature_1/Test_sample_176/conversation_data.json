    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula relates luminosity to the star's radius (R) and its surface temperature (T):\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂), we can divide their respective Stefan-Boltzmann equations:\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂ )⁴\n\n3.  **Given Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  or  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n    *   Substituting this into our ratio gives: L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio from Wien's Law and Doppler Effect**:\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law** states that the wavelength of peak emission (λ_peak) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. This implies we must account for the Doppler effect due to their radial velocities.\n    *   Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs₁) is the same as its rest-frame peak wavelength (λ_rest₁).\n    *   Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. This motion causes a relativistic Doppler shift in the wavelength. Since the star is moving, its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is related to the rest-frame wavelength by:\n        λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)], where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have:\n        λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]\n    *   Now, applying Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T, where b is Wien's constant):\n        b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]\n    *   This simplifies to the temperature ratio:\n        T₁ / T₂ = √[(1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)]\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (√[(1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)])⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)]²\n    *   Using the values v = 700 km/s and c ≈ 299,792 km/s:\n        v/c ≈ 700 / 299792 ≈ 0.002335\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * [(1 - 0.002335) / (1 + 0.002335)]²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * [0.997665 / 1.002335]²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * (0.99534)²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
