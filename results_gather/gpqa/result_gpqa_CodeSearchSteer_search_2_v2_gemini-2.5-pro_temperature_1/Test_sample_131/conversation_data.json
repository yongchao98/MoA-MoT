    "My initial analysis was based on predicting the 1H NMR spectra from the structures of the compounds. The search results confirm my predictions.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it shows one singlet for the two aromatic protons (~6.89 ppm) and one singlet for the twelve protons of the four equivalent methyl groups (~2.18 ppm).\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. It shows one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6 (~6.88 ppm). It has two distinct sets of methyl groups: the ones at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the ones at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in two singlets of equal integration (6H each) in the alkyl region (~2.17 and ~2.24 ppm).\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This compound has lower symmetry. It has two non-equivalent aromatic protons, which should give two separate singlets (1H each). It has three sets of methyl groups in a 2:1:1 ratio (6H, 3H, 3H), which will result in three singlets in the alkyl region.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The spectrum of this compound shows signals for the aromatic protons (a singlet because they are all equivalent) and a characteristic ethyl group pattern (a quartet and a triplet), not just singlets in the alkyl region. This confirms it can be ruled out.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the mixture based on the confirmed spectral data for the compounds in option D.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (1:1 ratio):**\n\n1.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n    *   Since the chemical shifts are slightly different, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Because each signal comes from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the two singlets will have a **1:1 integration ratio**. This matches the experimental data.\n\n2.  **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet** corresponding to its 12 equivalent methyl protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets** corresponding to its two sets of non-equivalent methyl groups (6 protons each).\n    *   In total, the mixture will show **three singlets** in the alkyl region.\n    *   The integration ratio will be 12H (from 1,2,4,5-isomer) : 6H (from 1,2,3,4-isomer) : 6H (from 1,2,3,4-isomer).\n    *   This simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n*   **A)** 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the alkyl region.\n*   **B) and C)** Both of these options include 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which itself has two aromatic protons that give two separate singlets. When mixed with another tetramethylbenzene isomer that gives one aromatic singlet (like 1,2,4,5- or 1,2,3,4-), the resulting mixture would show a total of three aromatic singlets, which contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
