    "An analysis of each compound determines its potential for optical activity, which requires a molecule to be chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image).\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at multiple chiral centers ((3aR,7aS,E)). This indicates that it is a single, specific stereoisomer. As it is not a meso compound, it is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry between the two chiral carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral. It lacks an internal plane of symmetry, and its mirror image ((2S,3S)) is non-superimposable. Therefore, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation \"(R)\" indicates a specific configuration at a chiral center (the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group). This specific enantiomer is chiral and thus optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has multiple hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry, making it achiral and not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this ketone's structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. Lacking a chiral center and any other element of chirality, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that are chiral and therefore optically active:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nA total of 3 compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
