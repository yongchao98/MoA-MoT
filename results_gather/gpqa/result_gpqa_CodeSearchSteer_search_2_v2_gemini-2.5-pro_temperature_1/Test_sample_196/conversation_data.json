    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, we must deduce the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   A very broad peak in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n*   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n*   Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n**Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is likely from protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the 7.2 ppm signal is from protons next to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, likely a methine (CH) group in the benzylic position (attached to the benzene ring).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, characteristic of a methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, indicating a methyl (CH₃) group coupled to a single proton (the methine).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, representing a methyl (CH₃) group coupled to two protons (the methylene).\n\n**Putting it all together:** The alkyl chain is a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]. This group and a carboxylic acid group are attached to a benzene ring at the para positions. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which corresponds to option (D).\n\n### Reaction and Final Product Identification\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to alkanes. The reaction involves the reduction of the carboxyl group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\nR-COOH + 6HI (in presence of red P) → R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂\n\nIn this specific case:\n*   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring will remain unchanged.\n\nThe final product is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which can also be named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the predicted product with the given options:\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our determined product.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is *sec*-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n\nThus, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
