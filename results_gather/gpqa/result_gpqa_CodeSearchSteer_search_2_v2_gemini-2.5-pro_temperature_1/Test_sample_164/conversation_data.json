    "To determine the correct statement regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches from a single monomer (ethylene) using a dual-catalyst system, each of the senior scientist's claims must be evaluated. The process described involves one catalyst for ethylene polymerization and a second for the *in-situ* oligomerization of ethylene into α-olefins (like 1-hexene or 1-octene), which are then incorporated as comonomers to create branches.\n\n### Evaluation of the Statements:\n\n**A) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nWhile noble metals like palladium are used in various catalytic olefin reactions, and their high cost is a known factor in industrial catalysis, they are not the primary choice for this specific application. Research often focuses on replacing expensive precious metals with more cost-effective options like nickel and iron for large-scale processes such as olefin oligomerization. This statement is plausible but less relevant and definitive than other options.\n\n**B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThe essential additional step is the oligomerization of ethylene to form α-olefins. This statement is incorrect. Aluminum-based compounds, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), and various other alkylaluminum compounds, are widely used and often essential activators (or co-catalysts) for ethylene oligomerization systems based on metals like chromium, iron, and nickel. In fact, the specific interaction between the catalyst and the aluminum activator is crucial for achieving high activity and selectivity.\n\n**C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nThis statement is correct. Group VIa (or Group 6) of the periodic table includes chromium (Cr). Chromium-based catalysts are fundamental to the polyethylene industry, most notably the Phillips catalyst. Critically, specific chromium catalyst systems, when combined with activators like MAO or other alkylaluminum compounds, are highly effective for the selective oligomerization of ethylene to 1-hexene and 1-octene. This process generates the necessary comonomers *in-situ*. For example, modifying a Phillips (chromium) catalyst with an activator like triethylborane has been shown to generate 1-hexene in the reactor, which is then copolymerized to form linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE).\n\n**D) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nThis statement is also correct. Technologies using dual-catalyst or multi-site catalyst systems in a single reactor to produce polyethylene with tailored properties (like bimodality or specific branching) are commercially used. Companies like Chevron Phillips Chemical and Univation Technologies have developed and licensed such processes (e.g., MarTECH® Advanced Dual Loop, UNIPOL™ process) that can produce these advanced polymers in a single reactor setup.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements C and D are factually correct. However, statement C describes the fundamental chemical principle and the specific class of catalysts that enables the technology mentioned in statement D. In a scientific research context, understanding the type of catalyst to use is the key takeaway. The use of a Group VIa metal (chromium) is a well-established method for the required ethylene oligomerization, making statement C a fundamentally correct and instructive piece of information for the scientist.\n\n<<<C>>>"
