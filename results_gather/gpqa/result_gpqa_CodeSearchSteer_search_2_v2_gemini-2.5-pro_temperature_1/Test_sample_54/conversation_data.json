    "Based on the analysis of the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n### **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal corresponds to the three protons of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon. This is characteristic of an acetate group (`-O-C(=O)-CH₃`), which is present in all four possible answers.\n*   **Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):** The presence of signals between 4.5 and 8.0 ppm indicates protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl protons).\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a single vinyl proton. The most critical piece of information here is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for protons in a *trans* configuration across a double bond are typically in the range of 12-18 Hz. In contrast, *cis* protons show smaller coupling constants, usually between 6-12 Hz. The large J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* relationship between the two vinyl protons. This signal is a doublet because it is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal represents a methyl group (`CH₃-`) that is adjacent to a carbon with a single proton (`-CH-`), causing the signal to be split into a doublet. This corresponds to the propenyl group (`CH₃-CH=`).\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This signal corresponds to the second vinyl proton. It is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm). This splitting pattern confirms the connectivity `CH₃-CH=CH-`.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe structure that fits all the data is Trans-propenyl acetate:\n\n*   The presence of a propenyl group (`CH₃-CH=CH-`) and an acetate group (`-OCOCH₃`) accounts for all atoms.\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) confirms the *trans* stereochemistry of the double bond.\n*   The splitting patterns (singlet, doublet, doublet of quartets) and integrations (3H, 3H, 1H, 1H) are perfectly consistent with this structure.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n*   **Cis-propenyl acetate** would show a smaller J-coupling constant (typically 6-12 Hz).\n*   **Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate** are incorrect as the spectrum clearly indicates a propenyl group (`CH₃-CH=`), not a butenyl group which would have an additional CH₂ or CH₃ group and result in a different NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
