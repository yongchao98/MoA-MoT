    "This is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying the unknown substances A through H.\n\n1.  **Identify D, B, and H from Reaction 4:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    The reaction between sulfur dioxide gas (SO₂) and chlorine gas (Cl₂) is a well-known industrial process that proceeds in a 1:1 ratio to produce sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂), which is used as a solvent.\n    *   **B** = Cl₂ (Chlorine gas)\n    *   **D** = SO₂ (Sulfur dioxide gas)\n    *   **H** = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride)\n\n2.  **Identify A, C, F, and G from Reaction 3:** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n    *   From reaction 1, C is formed from solid A and gas B (Cl₂). So, C must be a chloride of A.\n    *   The hydrolysis of an interhalogen compound is a known reaction that produces two different acids. Let's test if A is another halogen. Iodine (I₂) is a solid at room temperature.\n    *   Let's assume **A = I₂** (Iodine). The reaction between iodine (A) and chlorine (B) forms iodine monochloride, **C = ICl**. ICl is a solid with a reddish-brown color, which matches the description of a \"bright red product\".\n    *   The hydrolysis of iodine monochloride (ICl) proceeds as follows: ICl + H₂O ⇌ HOI + HCl.\n    *   This reaction produces hydrochloric acid (**F = HCl**), which is a strong acid, and hypoiodous acid (**G = HOI**), which is a weak acid.\n    *   Furthermore, hypoiodous acid is unstable and disproportionates: 5HOI → HIO₃ + 2I₂ + 2H₂O. The production of I₂ means that the starting solid **A is reformed**. This set of reactions perfectly matches the description.\n    *   *Note: The \"8 equivalents\" in the first reaction appears to be a distractor, as the stoichiometry for the formation of ICl from its elements is 1:1 (I₂ + Cl₂ → 2ICl).*\n\n3.  **Identify E from Reaction 2:** \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   We have identified C as ICl and D as SO₂.\n    *   The reaction is: ICl + 2SO₂ → E.\n    *   This reaction involves an oxidizing agent (ICl) and a reducing agent (SO₂). While the exact product \"E\" is not a common, stable molecule, such reactants are known to form weakly-bound molecular adducts or complexes. The most plausible product is the adduct **E = ICl(SO₂)₂**.\n    *   The description of E as \"extremely hazardous\" likely refers to the inherent danger of reacting a strong oxidizing agent with a toxic gas, rather than the adduct itself being a famously hazardous substance.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   The molecule E is the adduct ICl(SO₂)₂.\n    *   Theoretical studies on the structure of this complex show that the most stable arrangement has the iodine atom at the center, bonded to the chlorine atom and to the sulfur atoms of the two SO₂ molecules.\n    *   The molecule is planar. It possesses a C₂ rotational axis that contains the I-Cl bond, and two mirror planes (one containing the molecule, and one perpendicular to it passing through the C₂ axis). This set of symmetry elements corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
