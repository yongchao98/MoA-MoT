    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must evaluate each star based on two main criteria: its visibility from the Paranal Observatory and whether its brightness allows for a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\n### **1. ESPRESSO Performance and VLT Limits**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limiting Magnitude:** The ESPRESSO User Manual and related performance documents indicate that with a single 8.2m Unit Telescope (UT), it is possible to observe a target with a V-band magnitude of 19 in a one-hour exposure to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10. Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude (m_V) of 19.0 or brighter will be considered detectable.\n*   **Paranal Observatory Location:** The observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees.\n*   **VLT Declination Limit:** The VLT has a technical safety limit at a zenith distance of 70 degrees. For an observatory at latitude -24.6°, this translates to an observable declination range. The southern limit is -94.6° (i.e., the entire southern celestial pole), and the northern limit is approximately +45.4°. However, for practical, high-quality observations, a more conservative limit is often used. Stars with declinations up to about +24 degrees are easily accessible. For the purpose of this analysis, we will consider stars south of approximately +30° declination as readily observable.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Each Star**\n\nWe will now calculate the apparent magnitude (if necessary) and check the declination for each star.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** -0.74.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -52° 41′ 44.3810″.\n*   **Analysis:** With a declination of -52°, Canopus is easily observable from Paranal. Its apparent magnitude of -0.74 is significantly brighter than the m_V = 19 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Fluctuates around 1.98.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** +89° 15′ 50.8″.\n*   **Analysis:** With a declination of +89°, Polaris is located at the north celestial pole and is not visible from the Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 at 10 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Using the distance modulus formula `m_V = M_V - 5 + 5 * log10(d)`:\n    `m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) = 10 + 5 * 1 = 15.0`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0°.\n*   **Analysis:** A declination of 0° is perfectly observable from Paranal. An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the m_V = 19 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 at 200 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** `m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(200) = 10 + 5 * 2.301 = 10 + 11.505 = 21.5`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0°.\n*   **Analysis:** A declination of 0° is observable. However, its apparent magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than the m_V = 19 limit for achieving the required S/N ratio in one hour.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 at 5 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** `m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) = 10 + 5 * 0.699 = 10 + 3.495 = 13.5`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0°.\n*   **Analysis:** A declination of 0° is observable. The apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the m_V = 19 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 at 50 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** `m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(50) = 10 + 5 * 1.699 = 10 + 8.495 = 18.5`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0°.\n*   **Analysis:** A declination of 0° is observable. The apparent magnitude of 18.5 is brighter than the m_V = 19 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n### **Summary**\n\n| Star | Apparent Magnitude (m_V) | Declination (DEC) | Observable from Paranal? | Bright Enough (m_V ≤ 19)? | Detectable? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **a) Canopus** | -0.74 | ~ -52° | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |\n| **b) Polaris** | ~1.98 | ~ +89° | No | Yes | **No** |\n| **c) Star at 10 pc** | 15.0 | 0° | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |\n| **d) Star at 200 pc** | 21.5 | 0° | Yes | No | **No** |\n| **e) Star at 5 pc** | 13.5 | 0° | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |\n| **f) Star at 50 pc** | 18.5 | 0° | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |\n\nCounting the detectable stars: Canopus, the star at 10 pc, the star at 5 pc, and the star at 50 pc. In total, four stars are detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
