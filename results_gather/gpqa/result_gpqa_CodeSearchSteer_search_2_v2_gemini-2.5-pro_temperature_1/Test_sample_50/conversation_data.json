    "To determine the net potential energy of a system consisting of a charge *q* placed at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*, the method of images is employed.\n\nThe fundamental principle of this method is to replace the conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge, which, along with the original charge *q*, replicates the electric field and potential outside the sphere. For a grounded conducting sphere, the potential on its surface is zero.\n\nThe image charge, denoted as *q'*, is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the real charge *q*. The magnitude and position of this image charge are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge (q'):** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position of image charge (b) from the center:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from an infinite distance to its position at distance *d*. This can be calculated as half of the interaction energy between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'*.\n\nThe interaction energy (*U_interaction*) between two point charges is given by the formula `U = k * (q1 * q2) / r`, where *r* is the distance between the charges. In this case, the distance between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'* is `d - b`.\n\nSubstituting the expression for *b*, the distance is:\n`d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nNow, we can calculate the interaction energy between *q* and *q'*:\n`U_interaction = k * (q * q') / (d - b)`\n`U_interaction = k * (q * [-q * (R/d)]) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n`U_interaction = -k * (q^2 * R / d) * (d / (d^2 - R^2))`\n`U_interaction = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThe net potential energy (*U*) of the system is half of this interaction energy:\n`U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n`U = (1/2) * [-k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
