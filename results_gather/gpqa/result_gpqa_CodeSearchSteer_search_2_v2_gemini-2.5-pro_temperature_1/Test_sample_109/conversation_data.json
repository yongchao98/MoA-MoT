    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider two factors: the star's visibility from each observatory and its apparent brightness.\n\n### 1. Observatory Visibility\n\nA star must be visible in the sky from both observatories. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the geographic latitude of the observatories.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (VLT/ESPRESSO):** Located in Chile at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. This southern location is ideal for observing the southern sky but can also observe objects in the northern sky up to a certain declination. The theoretical limit for visibility is a declination less than +65.4° (90° - 24.6°).\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located in Hawaii at a latitude of about 19.8° North. It is designed to observe the northern sky but can also view objects in the southern sky. The theoretical visibility limit extends down to a declination of -70.2° (19.8° - 90°).\n\nFor a star to be observable from both sites, its declination must be within the shared range of approximately **-70.2° to +65.4°**.\n\nLet's check the visibility of each star:\n*   **Star1 (DEC = -75°):** Not visible from Keck.\n*   **Star2 (DEC = 55°):** Visible from both.\n*   **Star3 (DEC = 48°):** Visible from both.\n*   **Star4 (DEC = -48°):** Visible from both.\n*   **Star5 (DEC = 60°):** Visible from both.\n\nTherefore, Star1 is eliminated based on its location.\n\n### 2. Brightness Limit\n\nBoth instruments have a limit on how faint a star they can observe. A star must be brighter than the limits of *both* spectrographs.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO limit:** Apparent V magnitude < 17.0 mag.\n*   **HIRES limit:** Apparent V magnitude < 16.0 mag.\n\nThe combined requirement is that a star must have an **apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16.0 mag**.\n\nThe apparent magnitude is calculated using the distance modulus formula, which accounts for the absolute magnitude (M), distance (d), and interstellar absorption (A_V). The formula is:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nNow, let's calculate the apparent V magnitude for the remaining stars:\n\n*   **Star2:** The apparent V magnitude is given directly as **16.5 mag**. This is not brighter than the 16.0 mag limit for HIRES.\n*   **Star3:** The apparent V magnitude is given as **15.5 mag**. This value is brighter than 16.0, making it observable by both instruments.\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag\n    *   d = 10 pc\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n    *   This is not brighter than the 16.0 mag limit for HIRES.\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   M_V = 16.5 mag\n    *   d = 5 pc\n    *   A_V = 0 (since E(B-V) is not specified)\n    *   Using the value log10(5) ≈ 0.699.\n    *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**.\n    *   This is brighter than 16.0, making it observable by both instruments.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on both visibility and brightness criteria, only Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<A>>>"
