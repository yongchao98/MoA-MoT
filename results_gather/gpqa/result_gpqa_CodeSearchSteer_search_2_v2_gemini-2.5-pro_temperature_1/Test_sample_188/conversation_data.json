    "When a continuous symmetry of a physical system is spontaneously broken, Goldstone's theorem predicts the existence of massless (or nearly massless in the case of an approximate symmetry) particles known as Goldstone bosons. Examining each of the given particles in this context reveals their association with spontaneously broken symmetries.\n\n*   **Magnon:** In magnetic materials like ferromagnets, the individual atomic spins align in a specific direction below a critical temperature, spontaneously breaking the global rotational symmetry of the system. The collective excitations of these aligned spins are spin waves, and their quanta are called magnons. Magnons are the Goldstone bosons corresponding to the breaking of this rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Phonon:** In a crystalline solid, atoms are arranged in a regular lattice. The formation of this lattice breaks the continuous translational and rotational symmetry of free space. Phonons are the quanta of the vibrational modes of this lattice. They are considered the Goldstone bosons that arise from the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry.\n\n*   **Pion:** In the theory of strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics), a global symmetry known as chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. This symmetry breaking is responsible for the majority of the mass of nucleons. The pions are the resulting pseudo-Goldstone bosons, which would be massless if the chiral symmetry were exact (i.e., if quarks were massless).\n\n*   **Skyrmion:** A Skyrmion is a topological soliton, a stable, particle-like configuration of a field. It was originally proposed as a model for nucleons (like protons and neutrons) arising from a field theory of pions. While Skyrmions exist in systems where symmetries are broken, they are not the Goldstone bosons themselves. Instead, they are more complex, topologically protected structures whose existence is guaranteed by the topology of the field configurations, not directly by the symmetry breaking in the way Goldstone bosons are. In models where pions are the Goldstone bosons, Skyrmions emerge as solitonic solutions representing baryons.\n\nTherefore, magnons, phonons, and pions are all directly associated with spontaneously broken symmetries as Goldstone or pseudo-Goldstone bosons. The Skyrmion, being a topological soliton, is not.\n\n<<<A>>>"
