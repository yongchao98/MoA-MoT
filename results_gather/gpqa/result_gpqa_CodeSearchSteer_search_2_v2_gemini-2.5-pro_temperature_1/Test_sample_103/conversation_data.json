    "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we must analyze the information provided within the framework of the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n\n### Analysis of the Radial Velocity Method\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. This shift is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it and the planet orbit their common center of mass. The key parameters are:\n\n*   **Wavelength Shift (Δλ):** The observed shift in a spectral line. This is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r).\n*   **Radial Velocity Semi-amplitude (K):** The maximum speed of the star along the observer's line of sight. For a circular orbit, this is the amplitude of the sinusoidal velocity curve. Since K is the maximum velocity, it is proportional to the maximum wavelength shift.\n*   **Orbital Period (P):** The time it takes for the planet to complete one orbit, which is the same as the period of the star's wobble.\n\nThe mathematical relationship between these parameters for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK ∝ (mₚ sin(i)) / (Mₑ^(2/3) * P^(1/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   `mₚ` is the planet's mass.\n*   `Mₑ` is the star's mass.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle relative to the plane of the sky).\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n\nThe term `mₚ sin(i)` is known as the \"minimum mass\" because the inclination `i` is often unknown, and the RV method can only determine this combined value.\n\n### Applying the Formula to the Problem\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to K:** The periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n    *   For planet #1: K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   For planet #2: K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5.\n\n2.  **Setting up the Proportionality:** We can set up a ratio of the equations for the two planetary systems.\n    *   K₁ ∝ (m₁ sin(i₁)) / (M₁^(2/3) * P₁^(1/3))\n    *   K₂ ∝ (m₂ sin(i₂)) / (M₂^(2/3) * P₂^(1/3))\n\n3.  **Simplifying with Given Information:** The problem provides crucial simplifying conditions:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M₁ = M₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: This is interpreted in the context of RV measurements as the minimum masses being similar, so m₁ sin(i₁) ≈ m₂ sin(i₂).\n\n    With these conditions, the mass terms (both for the star and the planet's minimum mass) cancel out when we take the ratio:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ = [(1 / P₂^(1/3))] / [(1 / P₁^(1/3))] = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Solving for the Period Ratio:** Now, we can substitute the known values and solve for the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁).\n    *   7 / 5 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find P₂ / P₁, we first cube both sides:\n    *   (7 / 5)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    *   343 / 125 = P₁ / P₂\n    *   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    Finally, we invert the fraction to get the desired ratio:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value corresponds to approximately 0.36.\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
