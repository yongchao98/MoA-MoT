    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the spotted star, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the star's rotation.\n\n### 1. Modeling the Star's Brightness Variation\n\nThe variation in the star's brightness is due to one hemisphere being clear and the other being partially covered by cooler, dark spots. The brightness is at its maximum when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer and at its minimum when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n\nWe can model the flux (brightness) using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (Teff⁴).\n\n*   **Star's effective temperature (Teff_star):** 6000 K\n*   **Spot temperature (Teff_spot):** 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **Spot filling factor (f):** 20% or 0.20\n\n**Maximum Flux (F_max):**\nThis occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature of 6000 K. The flux is proportional to:\n`F_max ∝ Teff_star⁴`\n\n**Minimum Flux (F_min):**\nThis occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. On this side, 20% of the area is covered by spots (5000 K) and the remaining 80% is the normal photosphere (6000 K). The flux is a weighted average of the two temperatures:\n`F_min ∝ (0.80 * Teff_star⁴) + (0.20 * Teff_spot⁴)`\n\n**Amplitude of Variation:**\nThe relative amplitude of the light curve is the difference in flux divided by the maximum flux:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nSubstituting the expressions above:\n`Amplitude = (Teff_star⁴ - [0.80 * Teff_star⁴ + 0.20 * Teff_spot⁴]) / Teff_star⁴`\n`Amplitude = (0.20 * Teff_star⁴ - 0.20 * Teff_spot⁴) / Teff_star⁴`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the temperature values:\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the rotational modulation due to the spots causes a brightness variation of about 10.36%.\n\n### 2. Relating to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nThe problem asks for the radius of a hypothetical planet that would cause the same amplitude signal on an otherwise unspotted star. For an exoplanet transit, the dip in brightness, known as the transit depth, is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This is equivalent to the square of the ratio of their radii (Rpl/Rstar).\n\n`Transit Depth = (Rpl / Rstar)²`\n\nTo produce the same signal, the transit depth must equal the amplitude calculated from the starspots:\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = Amplitude`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Planet's Relative Radius\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius by taking the square root:\n`Rpl / Rstar = √0.10355`\n`Rpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
