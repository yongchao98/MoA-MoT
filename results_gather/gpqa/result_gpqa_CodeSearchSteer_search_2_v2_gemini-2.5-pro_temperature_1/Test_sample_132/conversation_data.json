    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), we must first calculate the concentrations of the buffer components and the pH of the solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n\n*   **Volume of the solution:** 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n*   **KH₂PO₄ (provides H₂PO₄⁻, the acid component):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (provides HPO₄²⁻, the base component):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**2. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n\nThe primary equilibrium in this buffer solution involves the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Ka₂ expression:** Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   **Ka₂ value:** 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for [H⁺]:\n\n*   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * 1.308\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n**3. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n\nThe concentration of orthophosphate (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₃.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Ka₃ expression:** Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   **Ka₃ value:** 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\nWe rearrange the formula to solve for [PO₄³⁻], using the previously calculated [H⁺] and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻], as its dissociation is minimal.\n\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
