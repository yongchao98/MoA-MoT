    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the momentum of the absorbed photon.\n\n### 1. Identify the Transition\n*   The molecule is initially in its fundamental (ground) state. In the rotation-vibration model, this corresponds to the lowest vibrational and rotational quantum numbers: vibrational state `v=0` and rotational state `J=0`.\n*   For a photon to be absorbed by a diatomic molecule and cause a rovibrational transition, specific selection rules must be followed. The rules for the simplest transitions are that the vibrational quantum number must change by +1 (`Δv = +1`) and the rotational quantum number must change by +1 or -1 (`ΔJ = ±1`).\n*   Starting from the ground state (`J=0`), the only possible rotational change is an increase, so `ΔJ = +1`.\n*   Therefore, the molecule transitions from the initial state (`v=0, J=0`) to the final state (`v=1, J=1`).\n\n### 2. Determine the Energy of the Transition (ΔE)\nThe total energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies.\n\n*   **Energy Formula:**\n    `E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + J(J+1)ħ²/2I`\n    where:\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number.\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number.\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n*   **Energy of the Initial State (v=0, J=0):**\n    `E_initial = (0 + 1/2)ħω + 0(0+1)ħ²/2I = (1/2)ħω`\n\n*   **Energy of the Final State (v=1, J=1):**\n    `E_final = (1 + 1/2)ħω + 1(1+1)ħ²/2I = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n*   **Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between these two states.\n    `ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n    `ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - (1/2)ħω`\n    `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Required Values\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n    `μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n    Converting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n    `μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    `I = μ * R²`\n    Given R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    `I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²`\n    `I ≈ 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Energy of the Photon (ΔE)\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term (ħω):**\n    `ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Term (ħ²/I):**\n    `ħ²/I = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n*   **Total Energy (ΔE):**\n    `ΔE = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.21 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.217 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n    (Note: The rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy).\n\n### 5. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)\nThe energy (E) of a photon is related to its momentum (p) and the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s) by the formula `E = pc`.\n\n*   **Momentum Formula:**\n    `p = E / c`\n    `p = (4.217 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)`\n    `p ≈ 1.406 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) p = 1.1*10⁻²⁷ N·s\nB) p = 2.3*10⁻²⁷ N·s\nC) p = 1.9*10⁻²⁸ N·s\nD) p = 1.4*10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThe calculated momentum, approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
