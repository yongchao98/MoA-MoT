    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the System and Conditions:**\n    *   We have two planets orbiting the same star. They are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.\n    *   **Planet 1:** Has a transit impact parameter `b1 = 0.2` and an orbital period `P1 = 3 days`.\n    *   **Planet 2:** We need to find its maximum orbital period `P2_max`.\n    *   **Condition:** Planet 2 must exhibit both a transit (pass in front of the star) and an occultation (pass behind the star).\n\n2.  **Understand the Impact Parameter:**\n    *   The impact parameter, `b`, is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius (`R_s`).\n    *   The formula for the impact parameter is `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit and `i` is the orbital inclination with respect to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Determine the Conditions for Transit and Occultation:**\n    *   **Transit:** For a transit to occur, the planet must at least partially overlap the star's disk. This happens if the impact parameter `b` is less than `1 + (R_p / R_s)`, where `R_p` is the planet's radius.\n    *   **Occultation:** For an occultation to occur, the planet must pass behind the star's disk. This requires the center of the planet to pass at a projected distance from the star's center that is less than the star's radius. Therefore, the impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1.\n    *   **Combined Condition:** For both events to happen, both conditions must be met. Since `R_p` is always positive, the condition `b <= 1` is stricter than `b < 1 + (R_p / R_s)`. Thus, the limiting condition for both events is `b <= 1`.\n\n4.  **Relate the Two Planets:**\n    *   Since both planets are in the same system and the same orbital plane, the stellar radius `R_s` and the orbital inclination `i` are the same for both.\n    *   For Planet 1: `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s = 0.2`\n    *   For Planet 2, the maximum allowed impact parameter for an occultation is `b2_max = 1`. This will correspond to the maximum possible semi-major axis (`a2_max`) and thus the maximum orbital period (`P2_max`).\n    *   For Planet 2 at its maximum orbit: `b2_max = (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_s = 1`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes:**\n    *   We can find the ratio of the semi-major axes by dividing the equation for Planet 2 by the equation for Planet 1:\n    *   `(b2_max / b1) = [ (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_s ] / [ (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s ]`\n    *   The terms `cos(i)` and `R_s` cancel out, leaving:\n    *   `a2_max / a1 = b2_max / b1`\n    *   Substituting the values: `a2_max / a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   `(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3`\n    *   We can solve for `P2_max`:\n    *   `P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substitute the known values into the equation:\n    *   `P1 = 3 days`\n    *   `a2_max / a1 = 5`\n    *   `P2_max = 3 * (5)^(3/2)`\n    *   `5^(3/2) = 5 * sqrt(5) ≈ 5 * 2.236 = 11.18`\n    *   `P2_max ≈ 3 * 11.18 = 33.54 days`\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<B>>>"
