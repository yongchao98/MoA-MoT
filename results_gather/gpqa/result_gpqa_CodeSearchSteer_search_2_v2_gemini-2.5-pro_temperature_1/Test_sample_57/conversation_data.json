    "To answer which of the listed physical theories never requires regularization at high energies, we must examine the high-energy (ultraviolet) behavior of each theory.\n\n*   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is a quantum field theory that describes how light and matter interact. When calculating physical quantities in QED, infinities arise from loop diagrams, which represent virtual particles. To handle these ultraviolet divergences, a procedure called regularization is used to make the integrals finite, followed by renormalization to absorb the infinities into physical constants. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory runs into problems at high energies, or equivalently, at very short distances. A notable issue is the self-energy of a point-like electron, which becomes infinite. This divergence implies that a point particle would have infinite inertia, which is physically untenable. To resolve this, some form of regularization is needed, such as assuming the electron is not a point but an object with a finite size. Thus, classical electrodynamics faces high-energy problems that require regularization.\n\n*   **C) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is its potential to be a theory of quantum gravity that is free from ultraviolet (UV) divergences. Unlike point-particle theories, string theory posits that fundamental constituents are one-dimensional strings. This extended nature smooths out interactions at short distances, avoiding the infinities that plague quantum field theories. Consequently, superstring theory is believed to be UV-finite and does not require regularization for high-energy phenomena.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force, QCD is in many ways similar to QED. Perturbative calculations in QCD also lead to divergent integrals that must be treated with regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QCD necessitates regularization to make meaningful physical predictions.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the only option that is thought to be free from high-energy divergences and thus does not require regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
