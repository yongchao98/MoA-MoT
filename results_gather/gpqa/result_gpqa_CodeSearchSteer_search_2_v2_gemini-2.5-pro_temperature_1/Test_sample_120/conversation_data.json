    "The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), is a well-established method for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction:\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: The problem states, and chemical principles confirm, that the nucleophilic alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the epoxide is formed across carbons C1 and C6. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, while C6 is not. Therefore, the incoming methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction is an Sₙ2 displacement, which occurs with a complete inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked. The initial configuration at C6 is given as (S). The nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will invert this center to an (R) configuration.\n\n3.  **Fate of Other Stereocenters**:\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so they will retain their original (R) configurations.\n    *   The bond between C1 and the epoxide oxygen is cleaved, and upon workup, this oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the nucleophilic attack does not occur at C1, its configuration is retained as (R).\n\n### Determining the Product:\n\n*   **Starting Material Stereochemistry (Original Numbering)**: C1 is (R), C3 is (R), C4 is (R), and C6 is (S).\n*   **Reaction Outcome**: The methyl group attacks C6, inverting its stereocenter from (S) to (R). The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 remain unchanged.\n*   **Product Structure**: The reaction opens the bicyclic ring to form a substituted cyclohexanol. The original C1 now bears both its original methyl group and a new hydroxyl group. The original C6 now bears the new methyl group from the cuprate.\n*   **IUPAC Renumbering**: For naming the product, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The adjacent carbon, the original C6, becomes the new C2. Following this, the original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n*   **Final Product Stereochemistry (IUPAC Numbering)**:\n    *   New C1 (from original C1): (R)\n    *   New C2 (from original C6): Inverts from (S) to (R)\n    *   New C4 (from original C4): (R)\n    *   New C5 (from original C3): (R)\n\nThe resulting product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol with the stereochemistry (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\nTherefore, the correct product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
