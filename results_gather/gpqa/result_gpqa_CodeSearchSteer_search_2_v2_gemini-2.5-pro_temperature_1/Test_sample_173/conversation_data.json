    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is M*c² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   The more massive fragment is m₁: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe can determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (m₁c² and m₂c²) using the given relations.\n\n1.  Substitute m₁ = 2 * m₂ into the sum equation:\n    (2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n    3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\n    m₂ = 0.33 * M\n\n2.  Now, find m₁:\n    m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\n3.  Calculate their rest-mass energies:\n    *   **m₁c²** = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n    *   **m₂c²** = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies, due to the conservation of energy.\n\n*   Q = T₁ + T₂ = M*c² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/ (2m), where p is the momentum.\n\n*   From the conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: |p₁| = |p₂| = p_classical.\n*   Therefore, T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p_classical² / 2m₁) / (p_classical² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2.\n*   This gives us T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   Substituting T₂_classical: T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV.\n*   3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV**.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct Relativistic T₁\n\nFor the correct value, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)², where the total energy E = T + m*c².\n\n*   This can be rearranged to find the momentum: (pc)² = E² - (m*c²)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²).\n*   From the conservation of momentum, |p₁| = |p₂|, so (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n*   T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (m₁c²) = T₂² + 2 * T₂ * (m₂c²).\n*   We know T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁, m₁c² = 198 GeV, and m₂c² = 99 GeV.\n*   T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99).\n*   T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁).\n*   T₁² + 396*T₁ = T₁² + 603 - 204*T₁.\n*   Cancel T₁² from both sides: 396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁.\n*   (396 + 204) * T₁ = 603.\n*   600 * T₁ = 603.\n*   **T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV**.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n\n*   Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
