    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation using the provided information.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both. The problem states that we should assume both planets have the same albedo (`A1` = `A2`). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Semi-Major Axis and Radial Velocity\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines, caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's maximum radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`) by the following equation:\n\nK = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nWhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nBy rearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`, we get:\n\na = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nWe can now find the ratio `a2 / a1` using the formula from the previous step:\n\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²)]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (`G`) and the star's mass (`M_star`) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n### 4. Relating Radial Velocity to Doppler Shift\n\nThe observed Doppler shift (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (`K`). The relationship is given by `K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocities is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\nK1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ₀) / (c * Δλ2 / λ₀) = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes, we get:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)²\n\nNow, we can find the final ratio for the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ1) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ2) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
