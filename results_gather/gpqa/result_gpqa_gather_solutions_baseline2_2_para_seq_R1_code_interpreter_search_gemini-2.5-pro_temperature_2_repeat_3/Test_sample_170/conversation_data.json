Deconstruct the Question**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of **increasing** weight fraction of the yield of the **para-isomer** formed during electrophilic bromination.\nSince the monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) of a given starting material all have the same molar mass, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the mole fraction (or percentage yield). Therefore, the task is to rank the compounds by the increasing percentage yield of their para-brominated product.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents and Their Directing Effects**\nThe key to this problem lies in understanding how each substituent directs the incoming bromine electrophile.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directing Substituents (Low para-yield)**\n    These are deactivating groups that withdraw electron density from the ring, directing the electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH group is deactivating.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 group is deactivating.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directing Substituents (High para-yield)**\n    These groups direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is activating.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is activating.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group is deactivating but directs ortho, para.\n\nBased on this classification, any substance from Group 1 will have a lower para-yield than any substance from Group 2. The final order must be `{Group 1} < {Group 2}`.\n\n### **3. Order the Substances within Group 1 (Meta-directors)**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely proportional to the substituent's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group leads to higher selectivity for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nYield(Nitrobenzene) < Yield(Benzoic acid) < Yield(Ethyl benzoate)\nThe numerical order is: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **4. Order the Substances within Group 2 (Ortho, para-directors)**\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, favoring attack at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para yield than toluene (1). So, **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high selectivity for the para position.\n*   **Reconciling Steric and Electronic Effects:** This is the most subtle part of the problem. We compare the final para yields:\n    *   Bromination of Toluene (1) yields ~67% para-isomer.\n    *   Bromination of Chlorobenzene (3) yields ~87% para-isomer.\n    *   Bromination of Ethylbenzene (5) yields ~94% para-isomer.\n    Based on these experimental values, the correct order of increasing para-yield is: Toluene < Chlorobenzene < Ethylbenzene.\n    The numerical order is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n### **5. Assemble the Final Order and Compare with Options**\nCombining the rankings from both groups gives the complete, correct order:\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)**\n\nThe complete correct order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\nNow let's compare this correct order to the provided options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nNone of the options exactly matches the correct order derived from experimental data. This indicates the options are flawed. We must choose the best possible answer.\n\n*   **Option C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n    *   The ranking of the meta-directors (`4 < 6 < 2`) is **correct**.\n    *   The ranking of the ortho, para-directors (`1 < 5 < 3`) is **incorrect**. It swaps the last two elements (the correct order is `1 < 3 < 5`).\n\nHowever, Option C correctly identifies and orders the meta-directing group based on fundamental principles, which is the most straightforward part of the analysis. The incorrect ordering of the last two compounds is a common mistake when relying on qualitative arguments alone without considering experimental data. All other options contain more severe errors in the ranking of the meta-directors. Therefore, Option C is the most plausible and likely intended answer despite its minor inaccuracy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis task requires arranging six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer following an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\nThe compounds are:\n1.  C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2.  C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe position of the incoming bromine atom is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring. We can divide the substituents into two main categories:\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   **4) -NO2:** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH:** Deactivating.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5:** Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   **1) -CH3:** Activating.\n    *   **5) -C2H5:** Activating.\n    *   **3) -Cl:** Deactivating, but directs ortho, para.\n\nBased on this classification, the overall order will place the meta-directing compounds before the ortho, para-directing compounds: {4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Compounds**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the strength of the substituent's deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group results in higher selectivity for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nYield(Nitrobenzene) < Yield(Benzoic acid) < Yield(Ethyl benzoate)\nThis corresponds to the numerical order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Compounds**\n\nFor these compounds, we must compare the factors that influence the ratio of para to ortho substitution. Steric hindrance is a key factor; bulkier groups hinder attack at the ortho positions, increasing the para-isomer yield. Electronic effects are also important.\n\n*   **Toluene (1) vs. Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increases the preference for substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene yields more para-isomer than toluene. **Order: 1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparison with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect (-I), which is strongest at the ortho positions. This electronic effect disfavors ortho attack relative to para attack. This leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer for chlorobenzene, which is generally higher than that of both toluene and ethylbenzene under typical bromination conditions.\n*   Thus, the combined order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. **Order: 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Final Sequence**\n\nBy combining the rankings from the two groups, we get the complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\n\nThe final sequence is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A provided in the question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **Step 1: General Principle and Grouping**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents:**\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors** will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. These are substances **1 (-CH3)**, **5 (-C2H5)**, and **3 (-Cl)**.\n    *   **Meta-directors** will produce very small amounts of the para-isomer. These are substances **4 (-NO2)**, **6 (-COOH)**, and **2 (-COOC2H5)**.\n\n2.  **Establish General Order:**\n    The para-isomer yield from any meta-directing group will be significantly lower than the yield from any ortho, para-directing group. Therefore, the final ordered list will have the meta-directing group substances first, followed by the ortho, para-directing group substances.\n    Correct Order Structure: **{Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}**\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances {4, 6, 2}**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating (electron-withdrawing) effect. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **-NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5**\n*   This corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\nThis first part of the sequence, `4 < 6 < 2`, is a strong point of consensus among the majority of the agents, based on fundamental chemical principles. Any correct answer choice must start with this sequence or an equivalent permutation. Looking at the options:\n\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Incorrect order)\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect order)\n*   C) **4<6<2**<1<5<3 (**Correct start**)\n*   D) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect order)\n\nBased on this step alone, option **C** is the only plausible answer.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3} to Verify**\n\nThis step serves to confirm the validity of option C. The ordering within this group depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene (**1 < 5**).\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group is deactivating but an ortho, para-director. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para-substitution.\n\nCombining these factors leads to the order presented in option C: **1 < 5 < 3**. This means `Yield(Toluene) < Yield(Ethylbenzene) < Yield(Chlorobenzene)`. While some literature data under specific conditions might show ethylbenzene yielding slightly more para-product than chlorobenzene, the reasoning for `1 < 5 < 3` is chemically sound and accepted in many contexts. More importantly, it is the sequence present in the only option (C) that correctly orders the meta-directing groups.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n1.  The order of increasing para-yield for the meta-directing groups is conclusively **4 < 6 < 2**.\n2.  Only option C begins with this correct sequence.\n3.  The remainder of option C, which orders the ortho, para-directing groups as **1 < 5 < 3**, is based on consistent chemical reasoning.\n\nThe final combined order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe position of the incoming bromine atom is determined by the substituent already on the benzene ring. We must classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This will create two distinct groups based on expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    1)  **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating alkyl group.\n    5)  **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating alkyl group.\n    3)  **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating halogen group.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    4)  **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating group.\n    6)  **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating group.\n    2)  **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating group.\n\nBased on this classification, all substances in the meta-directing group will have a lower para-yield than any substance in the ortho, para-directing group. The correct final sequence must have the form `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`. This immediately invalidates options C and D, which do not follow this grouping.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the amount of the minor para-product is inversely related to the substituent's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group directs more forcefully to the meta position, resulting in a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\n*   The **-NO₂** group (4) is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the least para-isomer.\n*   The **-COOH** group (6) is less deactivating than -NO₂, but more deactivating than an ester.\n*   The **-COOC₂H₅** group (2) is the weakest deactivator of the three.\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\nThis finding allows us to evaluate the remaining options:\n*   A) `4<6<2...` (Consistent)\n*   B) `4<2<6...` (Inconsistent)\n\nBased on this step, Option A is the only plausible choice. To be certain, we will continue the analysis.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor this group, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The primary difference is steric bulk. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is larger than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size provides more steric hindrance at the adjacent ortho positions, making substitution at the more distant para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-product than toluene. This gives us the order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) is most pronounced at the nearby ortho positions, deactivating them more strongly than the para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high selectivity for the para position, often higher than that seen for simple alkylbenzenes. Therefore, the para-yield for chlorobenzene is expected to be higher than that for ethylbenzene. This gives us the order: **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for the ortho, para-directors is:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 4: Combine and Conclude**\n\nNow we combine the orders from the two groups:\n*   Meta-Directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho, Para-Directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete order is `{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}`, which results in the final sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the provided candidate answers and applying fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Their Directing Effects**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The key to solving this problem is understanding how the existing substituent on the benzene ring influences the position of the incoming bromine atom.\n\nWe can categorize the six substances into two main groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce very small, almost negligible, amounts of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitro group): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ester group): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Methyl group): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethyl group): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chloro group): Deactivating, but ortho, para-director.\n\nBased on this classification, the three substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-yields, and the three substances with ortho, para-directing groups will have the highest. The correct answer must follow the pattern: {Group of 2, 4, 6} < {Group of 1, 3, 5}.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Substances with Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the tiny amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more effective at directing meta, thus producing an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\n\nThe sequence must begin with `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Substances with Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nFor these substances, we need to determine the relative yield of the para-isomer compared to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by both steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** A common principle is that a larger alkyl group provides more steric hindrance at the adjacent ortho positions, which makes substitution at the unhindered para position more favorable. Since the ethyl group is larger than the methyl group, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-product than toluene. This gives the order: `1 < 5`.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group is a special case. It is a deactivating group but directs ortho/para. Its powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution. For bromination, chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (~89%), which is significantly greater than for toluene (~67%). This same logic places it above ethylbenzene as well.\n*   Therefore, the combined order for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3). The sequence for the high-yield group is `1 < 5 < 3`.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders and Select the Final Answer**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n(Group of 4, 6, 2) < (Group of 1, 3, 5)\nbecomes\n`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThis derived sequence exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis question requires us to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of their para-monobromo derivative upon electrophilic substitution. Since the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the isomer, we will focus on ranking the percentage yield.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe substituent on the benzene ring determines the position of the incoming bromine atom (the electrophile). We need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    1)  C6H5-**CH3** (Toluene): -CH3 is an activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    5)  C6H5-**C2H5** (Ethylbenzene): -C2H5 is an activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    3)  C6H5-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene): -Cl is a deactivating, but *ortho, para*-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    4)  C6H5-**NO2** (Nitrobenzene): -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    6)  C6H5-**COOH** (Benzoic acid): -COOH is a deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    2)  C6H5-**COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate): -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nBased on this, the compounds with meta-directors (`4, 6, 2`) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the compounds with ortho, para-directors (`1, 5, 3`) will have the highest. The final order will be structured as: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Compounds (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the small amount of para-isomer formed is inversely related to the strength of the group's deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group leads to greater selectivity for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is well-established:\n**-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of this deactivating strength:\nYield for nitrobenzene (4) < Yield for benzoic acid (6) < Yield for ethyl benzoate (2)\n\nThis gives us the first part of our sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Compounds (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. This is influenced by both steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Thus, ethylbenzene will have a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   This gives the order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is most felt at the nearby ortho positions, making them less reactive than the more distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene (~87%) is typically higher than that of toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (which can range but is also very high, sometimes cited higher than chlorobenzene, sometimes slightly lower depending on conditions). A common textbook ordering, considering the strong electronic preference, places chlorobenzene at the top.\n    *   This gives the order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Final Order and Compare with Options**\n\nCombining the two ordered groups:\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nNow we compare this derived sequence with the given options:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nOur derived order, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, perfectly matches option **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question requires us to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of **increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer** yield from electrophilic bromination. Since all monobromo-isomers of a given compound have the same molar mass, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the mole fraction (or percentage yield). Therefore, we need to order the compounds by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents and their Directing Effects**\nFirst, we must classify each substituent as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing. This is the most crucial factor determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a *significant* yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (methyl): Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (ethyl): Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating, but ortho,para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a *very low* yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (ester): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThis classification allows us to divide the substances into two distinct groups. The substances with meta-directing groups {4, 2, 6} will have the lowest para-yields, while those with ortho,para-directing groups {1, 3, 5} will have the highest yields.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the Meta-Directing Compounds {4, 2, 6}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a minor product. The yield of this minor product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more effective at directing substitution to the meta position, thus yielding even less of the para product.\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nC₆H₅-NO₂ (4) < C₆H₅-COOH (6) < C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (2)\nThis gives us the start of our sequence: **`4 < 6 < 2`**.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the Ortho,para-Directing Compounds {1, 3, 5}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. We need to rank them based on the proportion of para-substitution relative to ortho-substitution. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring attack at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene. This establishes the order: **`1 < 5`**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. They are deactivating but ortho,para-directing. Their strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I effect) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para substitution, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer for chlorobenzene. The standard conceptual model taught in organic chemistry emphasizes this high para-selectivity for halogens, often placing them as yielding a higher para proportion than simple alkylbenzenes. This leads to the order: **`5 < 3`**.\n\nCombining the ranking for this group gives the order: **`1 < 5 < 3`**.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Order and Choose the Correct Option**\nWe now combine the two ranked groups, knowing that all meta-directors have lower para-yields than all ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho,para-directors order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final sequence: **`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`**.\n\nThis complete sequence exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six monosubstituted benzene compounds in order of **increasing** weight fraction of the **para-isomer** formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. Since all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material have the same molar mass, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield. Therefore, we are arranging them by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding how each substituent directs the incoming electrophile (Br+).\nWe can separate the six compounds into two distinct groups:\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors.** These substituents are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. As a result, they will produce a very **low** yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitro group): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ester group): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directors.** These substituents direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a **high** yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Methyl group): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethyl group): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chloro group): Deactivating, but ortho, para-director.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final sequence must place all compounds from Group 1 before all compounds from Group 2.\n\n**3. Ordering Group 1 (Meta-directors)**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n*   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is strongly deactivating, but less so than the nitro group.\n*   The ester group (`-COOC2H5`) is also deactivating, but the electron-donating effect of the ethyl part makes it slightly less deactivating than a carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this deactivating strength:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\nThe beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Ordering Group 2 (Ortho, para-directors)**\nFor this group, we need to compare the ratio of para-product to ortho-product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is steric bulk. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is larger than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the more accessible para position. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-product than toluene. This gives us the relationship: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens are a special case. The chlorine atom is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect). This effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para-substitution. In most cases considered in textbook problems, this electronic effect for halogens is considered to result in a very high para-selectivity, higher than for simple alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene. This gives the relationship: **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining the rankings for this group, we get the order:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\nThe end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Final Assembly**\nNow we combine the two ordered groups:\n(Group 1 order) < (Group 2 order)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**6. Match with the Options**\nLet's compare our derived sequence with the provided choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nOur derived order, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option **B** exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires arranging six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination. Since all monobromo isomers for a given starting material have the same molecular weight, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield. The solution involves analyzing the directing effects of the substituents.\n\nHere is a step-by-step logical breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents by their Directing Effect\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This effect determines where the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) will preferentially attack the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH₃ (methyl in Toluene):** Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅ (ethyl in Ethylbenzene):** Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   **3) -Cl (chloro in Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating, but o,p-director due to lone pair resonance.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all strongly deactivating and result in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) -NO₂ (nitro in Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   **6) -COOH (carboxylic acid in Benzoic acid):** Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅ (ethyl ester in Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating, m-director.\n\n### Step 2: Form Two Groups Based on Directing Effect\n\nBased on the classification, we can separate the substances into two main groups. The meta-directing substances will produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\n*   **Group 1 (Low para-yield):** Substances with meta-directors: 4, 6, 2.\n*   **Group 2 (High para-yield):** Substances with ortho, para-directors: 1, 5, 3.\n\nTherefore, the final order will have all substances from Group 1 listed before the substances from Group 2.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Substances within Group 1 (Meta-Directors)\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer (a minor product) is inversely proportional to the substituent's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group leads to greater selectivity for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nSubstance 4 (-NO₂) < Substance 6 (-COOH) < Substance 2 (-COOC₂H₅)\n\nThe first part of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 4: Order the Substances within Group 2 (Ortho, Para-Directors)\n\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Toluene (1) vs. Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes substitution at the more accessible para position more favorable for ethylbenzene. Thus, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene. So, **1 < 5**.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3) vs. Alkylbenzenes (1 and 5):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect (-I effect), which withdraws electron density. This effect is strongest at the ortho positions, making them less reactive than the para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para substitution, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer. Literature data for bromination shows para-isomer yields of approximately:\n    *   Toluene (1): ~67%\n    *   Ethylbenzene (5): ~70-76%\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3): ~89%\nBased on this data, the order of increasing para-yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThe second part of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Groups to Form the Final Order\n\nNow we combine the ordered groups: (Group 1) < (Group 2).\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis final order corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since all monobrominated isomers have the same molar mass, this is equivalent to arranging them by increasing mole percent yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents by their Directing Effect\n\nThe first step is to determine how each substituent directs the incoming electrophile (Br⁺).\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene): Activating o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): Activating o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups will produce very small amounts of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating m-director.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating m-director.\n\nThis classification allows us to create two distinct groups. The final sequence will place the meta-directors first (lowest para-yield), followed by the ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield).\nOrder: {Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield)\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the small amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in a lower yield of the para-isomer.\nThe order of deactivating strength is well-established:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\nThis gives us the first part of the sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield)\n\nFor these compounds, the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer is determined by a balance of steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing 1 (-CH₃) and 5 (-C₂H₅):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** Halogens are a special case. Chlorine is a deactivating group but directs ortho/para. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) deactivates the entire ring, but this effect is strongest at the ortho positions. This electronic disfavoring of the ortho positions leads to a very high selectivity for the para position. In many standard academic problems, this effect is considered to result in a higher para yield than even bulky alkyl groups. Therefore, the para-yield for chlorobenzene (3) is considered the highest in this group. This gives the order: **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining the rankings for the ortho, para-directors gives the sequence: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Final Order\n\nWe combine the two ordered groups:\n(Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete, final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence for Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. A review of the candidate answers shows that several agents correctly reasoned to this exact sequence. While there are inconsistencies in which option letter they chose, their underlying chemical logic points to this result. Looking at the options provided in the prompt, this sequence matches one of the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during an electrophilic bromination reaction. Since the isomers (ortho, meta, para) of each brominated compound have the same molar mass, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield.\n\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring determines the position of the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+). We can classify the substituents into two main groups:\n\n1.  **Meta-directors:** These are deactivating groups that withdraw electron density from the ring. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) -NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid):** Deactivating.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl ester):** Deactivating.\n\n2.  **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH₃ (Methyl):** Activating alkyl group.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅ (Ethyl):** Activating alkyl group.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chloro):** Deactivating halogen, but ortho, para-directing.\n\nFrom this initial classification, we know that all the meta-directing compounds will have lower para-yields than all the ortho, para-directing compounds.\nThe final order will be: {compounds 2, 4, 6} < {compounds 1, 3, 5}.\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-directors (Lowest Para-yield)\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the small amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, thus producing an even smaller amount of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-directors (Highest Para-yield)\n\nFor these compounds, we must consider the factors that influence the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. The main factors are steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). The increased bulk hinders the electrophile's approach to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring attack at the less hindered para position. This means ethylbenzene will have a higher percentage of para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. alkyl groups (1, 5):** Halogens are a special case. The chlorine atom is deactivating due to its strong inductive electron-withdrawal (-I effect), but it is an ortho, para-director due to its ability to donate lone-pair electrons via resonance (+R effect). The inductive effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions, deactivating them more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high selectivity for the para position. Experimental data shows the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 87%). While the steric effect of the ethyl group is significant, the electronic effect in chlorobenzene makes it highly selective for the para position as well. The question's intended answer hinges on the relative magnitude of these effects. Comparing experimental data can be ambiguous as values vary by source. For example: Toluene (~67%), Ethylbenzene (~68-94%), Chlorobenzene (~87%). However, a very common ordering presented in textbooks, which prioritizes the halogen's electronic effect, is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Sequences and Select the Final Answer\n\nCombining the ordered groups gives the final sequence:\n(Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2)** < **(1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option B among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis is a problem in organic chemistry that requires understanding the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically the directing effects of various substituents on a benzene ring. The goal is to arrange six compounds in order of increasing yield of the para-brominated product.\n\n### **Step 1: General Principles and Classification**\n\nThe position of electrophilic attack on a substituted benzene ring is determined by the nature of the substituent already present. We can classify the given substituents into two main groups:\n\n1.  **Meta-directors:** These are deactivating groups that withdraw electron density from the ring. They direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer from these compounds will be very low.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** `-NO2` is a strongly deactivating meta-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** `-COOH` is a deactivating meta-director.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** `-COOC2H5` is a deactivating meta-director.\n\n2.  **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They are either activating groups or halogens. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** `-CH3` is an activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** `-C2H5` is an activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** `-Cl` is a deactivating, but ortho, para-director.\n\nFrom this initial classification, we can establish that the substances with meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, and those with ortho, para-directors will have the highest yields. The correct order must place {4, 6, 2} before {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 2: Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the very small yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more effective at directing substitution to the meta position, which means even less para product is formed.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n**-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield (the reverse of deactivating strength) is:\n**Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate**\nIn terms of substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **Step 3: Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, we need to compare the factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** This is the primary factor. A bulkier substituent hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`).\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Electronic Effects:** Halogens like chlorine (`-Cl`) are a special case. The chloro group deactivates the ring via its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but directs ortho/para via its electron-donating resonance effect (+M). The inductive effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions, deactivating them more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para attack, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer. Experimental data shows the para-yield for chlorobenzene (~87-89%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (~70-75%) during bromination.\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for chlorobenzene is the highest among this group.\n\nCombining these factors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene**\nIn terms of substance numbers: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 4: Combining the Orders**\n\nWe combine the results from the two groups:\n*   Meta-director order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-director order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence, in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer, is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis order corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n**Detailed Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer after electrophilic bromination. Since the monobrominated products for each starting material are isomers, they have the same molar mass. Therefore, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield. We are essentially ranking the compounds by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\nThe six compounds are:\n1) С6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by their Directing Effects**\n\nThe position of electrophilic substitution is determined by the substituent already on the benzene ring. We must classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) -NO2 (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5 (Ester group):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH3 (Methyl group):** Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **5) -C2H5 (Ethyl group):** Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chloro group):** Deactivating, but ortho, para-director.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, and the three ortho, para-directors will have the highest. The final order must be of the form: **{compounds 2, 4, 6} < {compounds 1, 3, 5}**. This immediately eliminates options A and D, which do not follow this pattern. We are left with options B and C.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in a lower percentage of the para-product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n**-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\nThe nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. The carboxylic acid is stronger than the ester because the alkyl group of the ester provides a slight electron-donating inductive effect, which slightly mitigates the overall deactivating nature compared to the acidic proton of the -COOH group.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\nYield(-NO2) < Yield(-COOH) < Yield(-COOC2H5)\nIn terms of substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\nLet's compare this to our remaining options:\n*   **B) 4<6<2<1<5<3**: The first part, `4 < 6 < 2`, matches our finding.\n*   **C) 4<2<6<3<1<5**: The first part, `4 < 2 < 6`, is incorrect.\n\nThis step alone strongly indicates that **B** is the correct answer.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3) to Confirm**\n\nThis ranking depends on the para/ortho product ratio, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para yield than toluene (1). Order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. They are deactivating but o,p-directing. The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates all positions, but the effect is strongest at the ortho position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, makes the para position highly favored. The para yield for chlorobenzene is very high (around 89%), which is significantly higher than for ethylbenzene (which is itself higher than toluene).\n\nSo, the order of increasing para yield is Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\nOrder: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Final Order**\n\nCombining the orders from Step 2 and Step 3:\n*   Meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\nThe final combined order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the chemical principles and a review of the candidate answers allows for a step-by-step determination of the correct order.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Grouping by Directing Effect\n\nThe first and most important step is to classify the substituents on the benzene ring based on their directing effect in electrophilic substitution. This separates the substances into two distinct groups based on their expected yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the ortho and para isomers.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final correct order must have all the meta-directing substances listed before the ortho, para-directing substances. Any option that violates this (e.g., `B) 3<5<1<6<2<4`) is incorrect.\n\n### Step 2: Ordering the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2)\n\nWithin the group of meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer. The established order of deactivating strength is:\n`-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\nThis partial sequence `4 < 6 < 2` must be present in the correct answer. Checking the options:\n*   A) 4<**2<6**<... : Incorrect\n*   B) ...**6<2<4**: Incorrect\n*   C) **6<2<4**... : Incorrect\n*   D) **4<6<2**<... : Correct\n\nBased on this step alone, only option D can be correct.\n\n### Step 3: Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3)\n\nTo confirm our conclusion, we will order the ortho, para-directors. The percentage yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n1.  **Toluene (1) vs. Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk at the ortho positions makes the para position more favorable for attack. Therefore, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene. This gives us the order **1 < 5**.\n2.  **Comparison with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group is a special case. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This powerful electronic effect strongly favors substitution at the para position. In many contexts, this electronic favoritism in halobenzenes results in a higher para-yield than for simple alkylbenzenes. Therefore, chlorobenzene has a higher para-yield than ethylbenzene. This gives us the order **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining these findings, the order for the ortho, para-directors is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### Step 4: Final Assembly\n\nCombining the ordered groups from Step 2 and Step 3 gives the final sequence:\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Their Directing Effects\n\nThe first step is to understand how each substituent affects the electrophilic substitution reaction. We can group them into two categories based on their directing effects.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These are deactivating groups that withdraw electron density from the ring. They direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br⁺) primarily to the meta position. As a result, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low for substances with these groups.\n    *   4) **C₆H₅-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): The -NO₂ group is strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n    *   6) **C₆H₅-COOH** (Benzoic acid): The -COOH group is deactivating and a meta-director.\n    *   2) **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): The -COOC₂H₅ group is deactivating and a meta-director.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **C₆H₅-CH₃** (Toluene): The -CH₃ group is an activating ortho,para-director.\n    *   5) **C₆H₅-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): The -C₂H₅ group is an activating ortho,para-director.\n    *   3) **C₆H₅-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): The -Cl group is a deactivating ortho,para-director.\n\nBased on this classification, the three substances with meta-directors will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while the three with ortho,para-directors will have the highest yields. The correct order must place all meta-directing substances before the ortho,para-directing ones.\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)\n\nWe need to arrange substances 4, 6, and 2 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. For meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating group. A stronger deactivating group leads to greater selectivity for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is well-established:\n**-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\n**C₆H₅-NO₂ < C₆H₅-COOH < C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅**\n\nUsing the substance numbers, the beginning of our sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho,Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)\n\nNow we arrange substances 1, 5, and 3. For these, the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer depends on steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes substitution at the less hindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. So, **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens are a special case. The chlorine atom is deactivating due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal (-I effect), but it directs ortho,para due to resonance (+M effect). The -I effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions, making them less reactive than the more distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para-substitution. Experimental data confirms that the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (~87-89%), which is significantly higher than that for both toluene (~66%) and ethylbenzene (~58-68%, values vary by source). Therefore, chlorobenzene will have the highest para-yield in this group.\n\nCombining these facts, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Final Order\n\nFinally, we combine the two ranked groups. The meta-directors come first, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho,para-director order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis order matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "**Analysis of the Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Problem**: The task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds by the increasing percentage yield of their para-brominated isomer. This depends entirely on the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n2.  **Classification of Substituents (The Primary Division)**: This is the most crucial step. Nearly all agents correctly identified two distinct groups:\n    *   **Meta-directors**: These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. They produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. The agents correctly identified these as **Nitrobenzene (4)**, **Benzoic acid (6)**, and **Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para-isomer. The agents correctly identified these as **Toluene (1)**, **Ethylbenzene (5)**, and **Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n    This primary classification establishes that any substance from the first group must have a lower para-yield than any substance from the second group. The correct final sequence must be structured as `{Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}`.\n\n3.  **Ranking within the Meta-directors {4, 6, 2}**: There is an almost universal consensus among the agents on this part.\n    *   **Principle**: For meta-directors, the very small yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n    *   **Deactivating Strength**: The established order is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   **Resulting Para-Yield Order**: Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer is in the reverse order: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    *   **Sequence**: This gives the first part of the final order: **`4 < 6 < 2`**.\n\n4.  **Ranking within the Ortho, Para-directors {1, 5, 3}**: This part is more subtle, but a strong consensus was also reached.\n    *   **Principle**: The ranking depends on the para-to-ortho product ratio, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **Toluene (1) vs. Ethylbenzene (5)**: The ethyl group is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, favoring the less-hindered para position. Therefore, the para-yield is higher for ethylbenzene. The order is **`1 < 5`**.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3) vs. Alkylbenzenes (1, 5)**: Halogens are a special case. The chlorine atom has a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para-substitution. In textbook examples and for typical reaction conditions, this effect results in chlorobenzene having a higher para-selectivity than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   **Resulting Para-Yield Order**: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   **Sequence**: This gives the second part of the final order: **`1 < 5 < 3`**.\n\n5.  **Final Assembly**: Combining the two ordered groups yields the complete sequence:\n    *   `(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)`\n    *   Final Order: **`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D in the provided list. Many of the candidate answers derived this exact chemical sequence but selected different letter options (A, B, C) due to apparent inconsistencies in the prompts they received. However, the underlying chemical reasoning across the board overwhelmingly supports the sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Deconstruct the Question**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of **increasing** weight fraction of the yield of the **para-isomer** formed during electrophilic bromination.\nSince the monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) of a given starting material all have the same molar mass, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the mole fraction (or percentage yield). Therefore, the task is to rank the compounds by the increasing percentage yield of their para-brominated product.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents and Their Directing Effects**\nThe key to this problem lies in understanding how each substituent directs the incoming bromine electrophile.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directing Substituents (Low para-yield)**\n    These are deactivating groups that withdraw electron density from the ring, directing the electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH group is deactivating.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 group is deactivating.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directing Substituents (High para-yield)**\n    These groups direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is activating.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is activating.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group is deactivating but directs ortho, para.\n\nBased on this classification, any substance from Group 1 will have a lower para-yield than any substance from Group 2. The final order must be `{Group 1} < {Group 2}`.\n\n### **3. Order the Substances within Group 1 (Meta-directors)**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely proportional to the substituent's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group leads to higher selectivity for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nYield(Nitrobenzene) < Yield(Benzoic acid) < Yield(Ethyl benzoate)\nThe numerical order is: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **4. Order the Substances within Group 2 (Ortho, para-directors)**\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, favoring attack at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para yield than toluene (1). So, **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high selectivity for the para position.\n*   **Reconciling Steric and Electronic Effects:** This is the most subtle part of the problem. We compare the final para yields:\n    *   Bromination of Toluene (1) yields ~67% para-isomer.\n    *   Bromination of Chlorobenzene (3) yields ~87% para-isomer.\n    *   Bromination of Ethylbenzene (5) yields ~94% para-isomer.\n    Based on these experimental values, the correct order of increasing para-yield is: Toluene < Chlorobenzene < Ethylbenzene.\n    The numerical order is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n### **5. Assemble the Final Order and Compare with Options**\nCombining the rankings from both groups gives the complete, correct order:\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)**\n\nThe complete correct order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\nNow let's compare this correct order to the provided options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nNone of the options exactly matches the correct order derived from experimental data. This indicates the options are flawed. We must choose the best possible answer.\n\n*   **Option C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n    *   The ranking of the meta-directors (`4 < 6 < 2`) is **correct**.\n    *   The ranking of the ortho, para-directors (`1 < 5 < 3`) is **incorrect**. It swaps the last two elements (the correct order is `1 < 3 < 5`).\n\nHowever, Option C correctly identifies and orders the meta-directing group based on fundamental principles, which is the most straightforward part of the analysis. The incorrect ordering of the last two compounds is a common mistake when relying on qualitative arguments alone without considering experimental data. All other options contain more severe errors in the ranking of the meta-directors. Therefore, Option C is the most plausible and likely intended answer despite its minor inaccuracy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis task requires arranging six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer following an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\nThe compounds are:\n1.  C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2.  C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe position of the incoming bromine atom is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring. We can divide the substituents into two main categories:\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   **4) -NO2:** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH:** Deactivating.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5:** Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   **1) -CH3:** Activating.\n    *   **5) -C2H5:** Activating.\n    *   **3) -Cl:** Deactivating, but directs ortho, para.\n\nBased on this classification, the overall order will place the meta-directing compounds before the ortho, para-directing compounds: {4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Compounds**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the strength of the substituent's deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group results in higher selectivity for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nYield(Nitrobenzene) < Yield(Benzoic acid) < Yield(Ethyl benzoate)\nThis corresponds to the numerical order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Compounds**\n\nFor these compounds, we must compare the factors that influence the ratio of para to ortho substitution. Steric hindrance is a key factor; bulkier groups hinder attack at the ortho positions, increasing the para-isomer yield. Electronic effects are also important.\n\n*   **Toluene (1) vs. Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increases the preference for substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene yields more para-isomer than toluene. **Order: 1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparison with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect (-I), which is strongest at the ortho positions. This electronic effect disfavors ortho attack relative to para attack. This leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer for chlorobenzene, which is generally higher than that of both toluene and ethylbenzene under typical bromination conditions.\n*   Thus, the combined order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. **Order: 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Final Sequence**\n\nBy combining the rankings from the two groups, we get the complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\n\nThe final sequence is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A provided in the question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **Step 1: General Principle and Grouping**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents:**\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors** will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. These are substances **1 (-CH3)**, **5 (-C2H5)**, and **3 (-Cl)**.\n    *   **Meta-directors** will produce very small amounts of the para-isomer. These are substances **4 (-NO2)**, **6 (-COOH)**, and **2 (-COOC2H5)**.\n\n2.  **Establish General Order:**\n    The para-isomer yield from any meta-directing group will be significantly lower than the yield from any ortho, para-directing group. Therefore, the final ordered list will have the meta-directing group substances first, followed by the ortho, para-directing group substances.\n    Correct Order Structure: **{Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}**\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances {4, 6, 2}**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating (electron-withdrawing) effect. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **-NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5**\n*   This corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\nThis first part of the sequence, `4 < 6 < 2`, is a strong point of consensus among the majority of the agents, based on fundamental chemical principles. Any correct answer choice must start with this sequence or an equivalent permutation. Looking at the options:\n\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Incorrect order)\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect order)\n*   C) **4<6<2**<1<5<3 (**Correct start**)\n*   D) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect order)\n\nBased on this step alone, option **C** is the only plausible answer.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3} to Verify**\n\nThis step serves to confirm the validity of option C. The ordering within this group depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene (**1 < 5**).\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group is deactivating but an ortho, para-director. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para-substitution.\n\nCombining these factors leads to the order presented in option C: **1 < 5 < 3**. This means `Yield(Toluene) < Yield(Ethylbenzene) < Yield(Chlorobenzene)`. While some literature data under specific conditions might show ethylbenzene yielding slightly more para-product than chlorobenzene, the reasoning for `1 < 5 < 3` is chemically sound and accepted in many contexts. More importantly, it is the sequence present in the only option (C) that correctly orders the meta-directing groups.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n1.  The order of increasing para-yield for the meta-directing groups is conclusively **4 < 6 < 2**.\n2.  Only option C begins with this correct sequence.\n3.  The remainder of option C, which orders the ortho, para-directing groups as **1 < 5 < 3**, is based on consistent chemical reasoning.\n\nThe final combined order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe position of the incoming bromine atom is determined by the substituent already on the benzene ring. We must classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This will create two distinct groups based on expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    1)  **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating alkyl group.\n    5)  **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating alkyl group.\n    3)  **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating halogen group.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    4)  **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating group.\n    6)  **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating group.\n    2)  **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating group.\n\nBased on this classification, all substances in the meta-directing group will have a lower para-yield than any substance in the ortho, para-directing group. The correct final sequence must have the form `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`. This immediately invalidates options C and D, which do not follow this grouping.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the amount of the minor para-product is inversely related to the substituent's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group directs more forcefully to the meta position, resulting in a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\n*   The **-NO₂** group (4) is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the least para-isomer.\n*   The **-COOH** group (6) is less deactivating than -NO₂, but more deactivating than an ester.\n*   The **-COOC₂H₅** group (2) is the weakest deactivator of the three.\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\nThis finding allows us to evaluate the remaining options:\n*   A) `4<6<2...` (Consistent)\n*   B) `4<2<6...` (Inconsistent)\n\nBased on this step, Option A is the only plausible choice. To be certain, we will continue the analysis.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor this group, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The primary difference is steric bulk. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is larger than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size provides more steric hindrance at the adjacent ortho positions, making substitution at the more distant para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-product than toluene. This gives us the order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) is most pronounced at the nearby ortho positions, deactivating them more strongly than the para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high selectivity for the para position, often higher than that seen for simple alkylbenzenes. Therefore, the para-yield for chlorobenzene is expected to be higher than that for ethylbenzene. This gives us the order: **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for the ortho, para-directors is:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 4: Combine and Conclude**\n\nNow we combine the orders from the two groups:\n*   Meta-Directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho, Para-Directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete order is `{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}`, which results in the final sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the provided candidate answers and applying fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Their Directing Effects**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The key to solving this problem is understanding how the existing substituent on the benzene ring influences the position of the incoming bromine atom.\n\nWe can categorize the six substances into two main groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These are deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce very small, almost negligible, amounts of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitro group): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ester group): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Methyl group): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethyl group): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chloro group): Deactivating, but ortho, para-director.\n\nBased on this classification, the three substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-yields, and the three substances with ortho, para-directing groups will have the highest. The correct answer must follow the pattern: {Group of 2, 4, 6} < {Group of 1, 3, 5}.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Substances with Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the tiny amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more effective at directing meta, thus producing an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\n\nThe sequence must begin with `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Substances with Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nFor these substances, we need to determine the relative yield of the para-isomer compared to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by both steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** A common principle is that a larger alkyl group provides more steric hindrance at the adjacent ortho positions, which makes substitution at the unhindered para position more favorable. Since the ethyl group is larger than the methyl group, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-product than toluene. This gives the order: `1 < 5`.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group is a special case. It is a deactivating group but directs ortho/para. Its powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution. For bromination, chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (~89%), which is significantly greater than for toluene (~67%). This same logic places it above ethylbenzene as well.\n*   Therefore, the combined order for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3). The sequence for the high-yield group is `1 < 5 < 3`.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders and Select the Final Answer**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n(Group of 4, 6, 2) < (Group of 1, 3, 5)\nbecomes\n`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThis derived sequence exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis question requires us to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of their para-monobromo derivative upon electrophilic substitution. Since the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the isomer, we will focus on ranking the percentage yield.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe substituent on the benzene ring determines the position of the incoming bromine atom (the electrophile). We need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    1)  C6H5-**CH3** (Toluene): -CH3 is an activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    5)  C6H5-**C2H5** (Ethylbenzene): -C2H5 is an activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    3)  C6H5-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene): -Cl is a deactivating, but *ortho, para*-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    4)  C6H5-**NO2** (Nitrobenzene): -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    6)  C6H5-**COOH** (Benzoic acid): -COOH is a deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    2)  C6H5-**COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate): -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nBased on this, the compounds with meta-directors (`4, 6, 2`) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the compounds with ortho, para-directors (`1, 5, 3`) will have the highest. The final order will be structured as: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Compounds (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the small amount of para-isomer formed is inversely related to the strength of the group's deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group leads to greater selectivity for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is well-established:\n**-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of this deactivating strength:\nYield for nitrobenzene (4) < Yield for benzoic acid (6) < Yield for ethyl benzoate (2)\n\nThis gives us the first part of our sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Compounds (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. This is influenced by both steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Thus, ethylbenzene will have a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   This gives the order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is most felt at the nearby ortho positions, making them less reactive than the more distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene (~87%) is typically higher than that of toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (which can range but is also very high, sometimes cited higher than chlorobenzene, sometimes slightly lower depending on conditions). A common textbook ordering, considering the strong electronic preference, places chlorobenzene at the top.\n    *   This gives the order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Final Order and Compare with Options**\n\nCombining the two ordered groups:\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nNow we compare this derived sequence with the given options:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nOur derived order, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, perfectly matches option **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question requires us to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of **increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer** yield from electrophilic bromination. Since all monobromo-isomers of a given compound have the same molar mass, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the mole fraction (or percentage yield). Therefore, we need to order the compounds by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents and their Directing Effects**\nFirst, we must classify each substituent as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing. This is the most crucial factor determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a *significant* yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (methyl): Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (ethyl): Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating, but ortho,para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a *very low* yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (ester): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThis classification allows us to divide the substances into two distinct groups. The substances with meta-directing groups {4, 2, 6} will have the lowest para-yields, while those with ortho,para-directing groups {1, 3, 5} will have the highest yields.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the Meta-Directing Compounds {4, 2, 6}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a minor product. The yield of this minor product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more effective at directing substitution to the meta position, thus yielding even less of the para product.\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nC₆H₅-NO₂ (4) < C₆H₅-COOH (6) < C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (2)\nThis gives us the start of our sequence: **`4 < 6 < 2`**.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the Ortho,para-Directing Compounds {1, 3, 5}**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. We need to rank them based on the proportion of para-substitution relative to ortho-substitution. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring attack at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene. This establishes the order: **`1 < 5`**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. They are deactivating but ortho,para-directing. Their strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I effect) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para substitution, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer for chlorobenzene. The standard conceptual model taught in organic chemistry emphasizes this high para-selectivity for halogens, often placing them as yielding a higher para proportion than simple alkylbenzenes. This leads to the order: **`5 < 3`**.\n\nCombining the ranking for this group gives the order: **`1 < 5 < 3`**.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Order and Choose the Correct Option**\nWe now combine the two ranked groups, knowing that all meta-directors have lower para-yields than all ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho,para-directors order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final sequence: **`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`**.\n\nThis complete sequence exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six monosubstituted benzene compounds in order of **increasing** weight fraction of the **para-isomer** formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. Since all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material have the same molar mass, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield. Therefore, we are arranging them by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding how each substituent directs the incoming electrophile (Br+).\nWe can separate the six compounds into two distinct groups:\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors.** These substituents are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. As a result, they will produce a very **low** yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitro group): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ester group): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directors.** These substituents direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a **high** yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Methyl group): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethyl group): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chloro group): Deactivating, but ortho, para-director.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final sequence must place all compounds from Group 1 before all compounds from Group 2.\n\n**3. Ordering Group 1 (Meta-directors)**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n*   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is strongly deactivating, but less so than the nitro group.\n*   The ester group (`-COOC2H5`) is also deactivating, but the electron-donating effect of the ethyl part makes it slightly less deactivating than a carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this deactivating strength:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\nThe beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Ordering Group 2 (Ortho, para-directors)**\nFor this group, we need to compare the ratio of para-product to ortho-product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is steric bulk. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is larger than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the more accessible para position. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-product than toluene. This gives us the relationship: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens are a special case. The chlorine atom is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect). This effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para-substitution. In most cases considered in textbook problems, this electronic effect for halogens is considered to result in a very high para-selectivity, higher than for simple alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene. This gives the relationship: **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining the rankings for this group, we get the order:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\nThe end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Final Assembly**\nNow we combine the two ordered groups:\n(Group 1 order) < (Group 2 order)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**6. Match with the Options**\nLet's compare our derived sequence with the provided choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nOur derived order, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option **B** exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires arranging six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination. Since all monobromo isomers for a given starting material have the same molecular weight, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield. The solution involves analyzing the directing effects of the substituents.\n\nHere is a step-by-step logical breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents by their Directing Effect\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This effect determines where the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) will preferentially attack the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH₃ (methyl in Toluene):** Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅ (ethyl in Ethylbenzene):** Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   **3) -Cl (chloro in Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating, but o,p-director due to lone pair resonance.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all strongly deactivating and result in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) -NO₂ (nitro in Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   **6) -COOH (carboxylic acid in Benzoic acid):** Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅ (ethyl ester in Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating, m-director.\n\n### Step 2: Form Two Groups Based on Directing Effect\n\nBased on the classification, we can separate the substances into two main groups. The meta-directing substances will produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\n*   **Group 1 (Low para-yield):** Substances with meta-directors: 4, 6, 2.\n*   **Group 2 (High para-yield):** Substances with ortho, para-directors: 1, 5, 3.\n\nTherefore, the final order will have all substances from Group 1 listed before the substances from Group 2.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Substances within Group 1 (Meta-Directors)\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer (a minor product) is inversely proportional to the substituent's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group leads to greater selectivity for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nSubstance 4 (-NO₂) < Substance 6 (-COOH) < Substance 2 (-COOC₂H₅)\n\nThe first part of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 4: Order the Substances within Group 2 (Ortho, Para-Directors)\n\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Toluene (1) vs. Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes substitution at the more accessible para position more favorable for ethylbenzene. Thus, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene. So, **1 < 5**.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3) vs. Alkylbenzenes (1 and 5):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect (-I effect), which withdraws electron density. This effect is strongest at the ortho positions, making them less reactive than the para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para substitution, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer. Literature data for bromination shows para-isomer yields of approximately:\n    *   Toluene (1): ~67%\n    *   Ethylbenzene (5): ~70-76%\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3): ~89%\nBased on this data, the order of increasing para-yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThe second part of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Groups to Form the Final Order\n\nNow we combine the ordered groups: (Group 1) < (Group 2).\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis final order corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since all monobrominated isomers have the same molar mass, this is equivalent to arranging them by increasing mole percent yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents by their Directing Effect\n\nThe first step is to determine how each substituent directs the incoming electrophile (Br⁺).\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene): Activating o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): Activating o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups will produce very small amounts of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating m-director.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating m-director.\n\nThis classification allows us to create two distinct groups. The final sequence will place the meta-directors first (lowest para-yield), followed by the ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield).\nOrder: {Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield)\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the small amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in a lower yield of the para-isomer.\nThe order of deactivating strength is well-established:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\nThis gives us the first part of the sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield)\n\nFor these compounds, the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer is determined by a balance of steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing 1 (-CH₃) and 5 (-C₂H₅):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** Halogens are a special case. Chlorine is a deactivating group but directs ortho/para. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) deactivates the entire ring, but this effect is strongest at the ortho positions. This electronic disfavoring of the ortho positions leads to a very high selectivity for the para position. In many standard academic problems, this effect is considered to result in a higher para yield than even bulky alkyl groups. Therefore, the para-yield for chlorobenzene (3) is considered the highest in this group. This gives the order: **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining the rankings for the ortho, para-directors gives the sequence: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Final Order\n\nWe combine the two ordered groups:\n(Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete, final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence for Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. A review of the candidate answers shows that several agents correctly reasoned to this exact sequence. While there are inconsistencies in which option letter they chose, their underlying chemical logic points to this result. Looking at the options provided in the prompt, this sequence matches one of the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during an electrophilic bromination reaction. Since the isomers (ortho, meta, para) of each brominated compound have the same molar mass, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield.\n\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring determines the position of the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+). We can classify the substituents into two main groups:\n\n1.  **Meta-directors:** These are deactivating groups that withdraw electron density from the ring. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) -NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid):** Deactivating.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl ester):** Deactivating.\n\n2.  **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH₃ (Methyl):** Activating alkyl group.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅ (Ethyl):** Activating alkyl group.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chloro):** Deactivating halogen, but ortho, para-directing.\n\nFrom this initial classification, we know that all the meta-directing compounds will have lower para-yields than all the ortho, para-directing compounds.\nThe final order will be: {compounds 2, 4, 6} < {compounds 1, 3, 5}.\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-directors (Lowest Para-yield)\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the small amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, thus producing an even smaller amount of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-directors (Highest Para-yield)\n\nFor these compounds, we must consider the factors that influence the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. The main factors are steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). The increased bulk hinders the electrophile's approach to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring attack at the less hindered para position. This means ethylbenzene will have a higher percentage of para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. alkyl groups (1, 5):** Halogens are a special case. The chlorine atom is deactivating due to its strong inductive electron-withdrawal (-I effect), but it is an ortho, para-director due to its ability to donate lone-pair electrons via resonance (+R effect). The inductive effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions, deactivating them more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high selectivity for the para position. Experimental data shows the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 87%). While the steric effect of the ethyl group is significant, the electronic effect in chlorobenzene makes it highly selective for the para position as well. The question's intended answer hinges on the relative magnitude of these effects. Comparing experimental data can be ambiguous as values vary by source. For example: Toluene (~67%), Ethylbenzene (~68-94%), Chlorobenzene (~87%). However, a very common ordering presented in textbooks, which prioritizes the halogen's electronic effect, is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Sequences and Select the Final Answer\n\nCombining the ordered groups gives the final sequence:\n(Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2)** < **(1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option B among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis is a problem in organic chemistry that requires understanding the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically the directing effects of various substituents on a benzene ring. The goal is to arrange six compounds in order of increasing yield of the para-brominated product.\n\n### **Step 1: General Principles and Classification**\n\nThe position of electrophilic attack on a substituted benzene ring is determined by the nature of the substituent already present. We can classify the given substituents into two main groups:\n\n1.  **Meta-directors:** These are deactivating groups that withdraw electron density from the ring. They direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer from these compounds will be very low.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** `-NO2` is a strongly deactivating meta-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** `-COOH` is a deactivating meta-director.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** `-COOC2H5` is a deactivating meta-director.\n\n2.  **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They are either activating groups or halogens. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** `-CH3` is an activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** `-C2H5` is an activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** `-Cl` is a deactivating, but ortho, para-director.\n\nFrom this initial classification, we can establish that the substances with meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, and those with ortho, para-directors will have the highest yields. The correct order must place {4, 6, 2} before {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 2: Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the very small yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more effective at directing substitution to the meta position, which means even less para product is formed.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n**-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield (the reverse of deactivating strength) is:\n**Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate**\nIn terms of substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **Step 3: Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, we need to compare the factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** This is the primary factor. A bulkier substituent hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`).\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Electronic Effects:** Halogens like chlorine (`-Cl`) are a special case. The chloro group deactivates the ring via its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but directs ortho/para via its electron-donating resonance effect (+M). The inductive effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions, deactivating them more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para attack, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer. Experimental data shows the para-yield for chlorobenzene (~87-89%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (~70-75%) during bromination.\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for chlorobenzene is the highest among this group.\n\nCombining these factors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene**\nIn terms of substance numbers: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 4: Combining the Orders**\n\nWe combine the results from the two groups:\n*   Meta-director order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-director order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence, in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer, is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis order corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n**Detailed Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer after electrophilic bromination. Since the monobrominated products for each starting material are isomers, they have the same molar mass. Therefore, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield. We are essentially ranking the compounds by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\nThe six compounds are:\n1) С6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by their Directing Effects**\n\nThe position of electrophilic substitution is determined by the substituent already on the benzene ring. We must classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) -NO2 (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5 (Ester group):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH3 (Methyl group):** Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **5) -C2H5 (Ethyl group):** Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chloro group):** Deactivating, but ortho, para-director.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, and the three ortho, para-directors will have the highest. The final order must be of the form: **{compounds 2, 4, 6} < {compounds 1, 3, 5}**. This immediately eliminates options A and D, which do not follow this pattern. We are left with options B and C.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in a lower percentage of the para-product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n**-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\nThe nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. The carboxylic acid is stronger than the ester because the alkyl group of the ester provides a slight electron-donating inductive effect, which slightly mitigates the overall deactivating nature compared to the acidic proton of the -COOH group.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\nYield(-NO2) < Yield(-COOH) < Yield(-COOC2H5)\nIn terms of substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\nLet's compare this to our remaining options:\n*   **B) 4<6<2<1<5<3**: The first part, `4 < 6 < 2`, matches our finding.\n*   **C) 4<2<6<3<1<5**: The first part, `4 < 2 < 6`, is incorrect.\n\nThis step alone strongly indicates that **B** is the correct answer.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3) to Confirm**\n\nThis ranking depends on the para/ortho product ratio, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para yield than toluene (1). Order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. They are deactivating but o,p-directing. The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates all positions, but the effect is strongest at the ortho position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, makes the para position highly favored. The para yield for chlorobenzene is very high (around 89%), which is significantly higher than for ethylbenzene (which is itself higher than toluene).\n\nSo, the order of increasing para yield is Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\nOrder: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Final Order**\n\nCombining the orders from Step 2 and Step 3:\n*   Meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\nThe final combined order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the chemical principles and a review of the candidate answers allows for a step-by-step determination of the correct order.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Grouping by Directing Effect\n\nThe first and most important step is to classify the substituents on the benzene ring based on their directing effect in electrophilic substitution. This separates the substances into two distinct groups based on their expected yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the ortho and para isomers.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final correct order must have all the meta-directing substances listed before the ortho, para-directing substances. Any option that violates this (e.g., `B) 3<5<1<6<2<4`) is incorrect.\n\n### Step 2: Ordering the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2)\n\nWithin the group of meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer. The established order of deactivating strength is:\n`-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\nThis partial sequence `4 < 6 < 2` must be present in the correct answer. Checking the options:\n*   A) 4<**2<6**<... : Incorrect\n*   B) ...**6<2<4**: Incorrect\n*   C) **6<2<4**... : Incorrect\n*   D) **4<6<2**<... : Correct\n\nBased on this step alone, only option D can be correct.\n\n### Step 3: Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3)\n\nTo confirm our conclusion, we will order the ortho, para-directors. The percentage yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n1.  **Toluene (1) vs. Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk at the ortho positions makes the para position more favorable for attack. Therefore, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene. This gives us the order **1 < 5**.\n2.  **Comparison with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group is a special case. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This powerful electronic effect strongly favors substitution at the para position. In many contexts, this electronic favoritism in halobenzenes results in a higher para-yield than for simple alkylbenzenes. Therefore, chlorobenzene has a higher para-yield than ethylbenzene. This gives us the order **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining these findings, the order for the ortho, para-directors is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### Step 4: Final Assembly\n\nCombining the ordered groups from Step 2 and Step 3 gives the final sequence:\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Their Directing Effects\n\nThe first step is to understand how each substituent affects the electrophilic substitution reaction. We can group them into two categories based on their directing effects.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These are deactivating groups that withdraw electron density from the ring. They direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br⁺) primarily to the meta position. As a result, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low for substances with these groups.\n    *   4) **C₆H₅-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): The -NO₂ group is strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n    *   6) **C₆H₅-COOH** (Benzoic acid): The -COOH group is deactivating and a meta-director.\n    *   2) **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): The -COOC₂H₅ group is deactivating and a meta-director.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **C₆H₅-CH₃** (Toluene): The -CH₃ group is an activating ortho,para-director.\n    *   5) **C₆H₅-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): The -C₂H₅ group is an activating ortho,para-director.\n    *   3) **C₆H₅-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): The -Cl group is a deactivating ortho,para-director.\n\nBased on this classification, the three substances with meta-directors will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while the three with ortho,para-directors will have the highest yields. The correct order must place all meta-directing substances before the ortho,para-directing ones.\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)\n\nWe need to arrange substances 4, 6, and 2 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. For meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating group. A stronger deactivating group leads to greater selectivity for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is well-established:\n**-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\n**C₆H₅-NO₂ < C₆H₅-COOH < C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅**\n\nUsing the substance numbers, the beginning of our sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho,Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)\n\nNow we arrange substances 1, 5, and 3. For these, the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer depends on steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes substitution at the less hindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. So, **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens are a special case. The chlorine atom is deactivating due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal (-I effect), but it directs ortho,para due to resonance (+M effect). The -I effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions, making them less reactive than the more distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para-substitution. Experimental data confirms that the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (~87-89%), which is significantly higher than that for both toluene (~66%) and ethylbenzene (~58-68%, values vary by source). Therefore, chlorobenzene will have the highest para-yield in this group.\n\nCombining these facts, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Final Order\n\nFinally, we combine the two ranked groups. The meta-directors come first, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho,para-director order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis order matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
