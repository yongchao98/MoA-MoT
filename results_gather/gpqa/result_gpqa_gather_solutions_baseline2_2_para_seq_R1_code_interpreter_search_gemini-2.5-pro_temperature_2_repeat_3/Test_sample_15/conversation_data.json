A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which usually means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. We will analyze each compound based on this principle.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)` is planar around the double bond. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n    *   There is a unanimous agreement on this point among all provided answers.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. The R/S notation is used to specify the absolute configuration of specific stereocenters. When a name describes a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound, a pure sample of it is by definition optically active. The molecule's complex structure is not symmetrical (not a meso compound).\n    *   All provided answers agree that this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH` has two stereocenters (C2 and C3) with identical substituents.\n    *   The configuration is `(2R,3S)`. For a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (`R,S` or `S,R`) is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral due to internal symmetry (a center of inversion in this case) and is therefore **not optically active**.\n    *   All provided answers are in agreement.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is the `(2R,3R)` stereoisomer of the same molecule. It is a diastereomer of the meso form. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` isomers are a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral because they lack any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   A single enantiomer is being described, so it is **optically active**.\n    *   All provided answers are in agreement.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, indicating a single enantiomer. Carbon C1 is a stereocenter as it is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, and the two different paths around the ring).\n    *   The molecule is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n    *   All provided answers are in agreement.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes a cyclohexane with three OH groups at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. The vast majority of the provided analyses correctly interpret this as referring to the most symmetric stereoisomer, the *all-cis* isomer.\n    *   The *all-cis* isomer possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring). Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**. Although one provided answer interprets the non-standard nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` as defining a specific chiral isomer, the overwhelming consensus treats this as an achiral molecule, which is the standard interpretation for this symmetrical substitution pattern.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. A careful examination reveals no stereocenters. The `CH` carbon is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. There are no other sources of chirality. The molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n    *   All provided answers are in agreement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThis gives a total of **3** optically active compounds. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally requires the absence of any symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the `C=C` double bond and the atoms directly bonded to them are coplanar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule. The molecule has no stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. This R/S notation is used to define the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters. When a name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule (and it's not a meso compound, which is evident from its complex, asymmetric structure), that substance is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is therefore **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 and C3 are identical. For such molecules, the diastereomer with opposite stereochemical configurations (one R, one S) is a *meso* compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image, and thus achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a meso form, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. This pair constitutes a set of enantiomers. The name `(2R,3R)` refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. It is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Analysis:** The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer. The source of chirality is the carbon atom at position 1 (C1), which is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different due to the asymmetric location of the double bond relative to C1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. It is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound, regardless of the stereoisomer, is achiral. Let's consider the two possible diastereomers. The all-cis isomer has a high degree of symmetry, including three planes of symmetry, making it achiral. The other diastereomer (one hydroxyl trans to the other two) also has a plane of symmetry that passes through the trans hydroxyl group, its carbon, and the opposite `CH2` group. Since all stereoisomers of this molecule are achiral, the compound is optically inactive.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. We search for stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to one hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the chain. Since it has two identical methyl groups attached, it is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters or other sources of chirality in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nIn total, there are **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has no stereocenters. The carbon-carbon double bond makes the molecule essentially planar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself specifies a single stereoisomer with absolute configurations `(3aR, 7aS)` at two chiral centers. A specific, single enantiomer of a chiral molecule is by definition **optically active**. The complex structure lacks symmetry, so it is not a meso compound.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), but its overall structure is symmetric. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a meso compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Meso compounds are achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` stereoisomer does not possess an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. As a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, and the two different paths around the ring: `-CH2-CH=` vs. `-CH=CH-CH2-`). It is therefore a stereocenter. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer of a chiral molecule. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, regardless of the stereoisomer, possesses a high degree of symmetry. Both the all-cis and the cis,cis,trans isomers of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol have a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. An inspection of the molecule reveals no stereocenters. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butan-1-one chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis task requires determining how many of seven given chemical compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. For a compound to be chiral, it must lack any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. This is an alkene. The molecule has a plane of symmetry containing the carbon-carbon double bond. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. These R/S designations specify the absolute configuration at specific chiral centers. The naming of a single, specific enantiomer indicates that the molecule is chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3) that are identically substituted. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a meso compound. Meso compounds possess stereocenters but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry). Achiral compounds are not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, existing as an enantiomeric pair with the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration. The carbon at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter, as it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the ring segment towards the double bond (`-CH2-CH=`), and the ring segment away from the double bond (`-CH2-CH2-`). As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation implies that the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule is highly symmetrical. Both of the possible diastereomers of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol (the all-cis and the cis,trans) possess planes of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We look for any chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the chain is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters in the molecule. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThus, there are 3 optically active compounds in the list.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule is an alkene. The atoms connected to the double bond lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule serves as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. This notation specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. Naming a specific enantiomer like this implies the compound is chiral and exists in a non-racemic form.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), but the substituents on each are identical. The `(2R, 3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). Meso compounds are not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule whose mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at carbon C1. C1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: an -H, an -OH, and two different paths around the ring due to the asymmetrically placed double bond (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name refers to a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This highly symmetric molecule possesses several planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through any C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring). The presence of symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We need to search for a chiral center (a carbon with four different groups). The only potential candidate is C3 of the butan-1-one chain, which is `CH(CH3)2`. However, it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n**Summary**\n\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** (Active)\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** (Active)\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** (Active)\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n**Analysis of each compound:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them are coplanar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry, rendering the molecule achiral. An achiral molecule is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This R/S notation is used to specify the absolute configuration of specific chiral centers. The naming of a single, specific enantiomer implies that the molecule is chiral and not a racemic mixture. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, meaning the substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3. In such cases, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (`R,S` or `S,R`) is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral due to internal symmetry (e.g., a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) and is therefore **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, existing as an enantiomer to the `(2S,3S)` form. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at a stereocenter (C1). Carbon 1 is a stereocenter because it's bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, and the two different paths around the ring containing the double bond. Since a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule is specified, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name represents a symmetrically substituted cyclohexane. The most common interpretation refers to the *all-cis* isomer. This molecule is highly symmetric and possesses multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through C1-OH and the opposite C4 atom). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore **not optically active**. Although the naming is non-standard, the most logical interpretation leads to an achiral structure.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We must check for any chiral centers. The only potential candidate, C3 of the butane chain, is bonded to a hydrogen, the rest of the chain, and two identical methyl groups. Since it has two identical groups attached, it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThus, a total of 3 compounds will exhibit optical activity.

Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of the molecule serves as a plane of symmetry.

The complex structure is not a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3) with identical substituents. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a meso compound. Meso compounds have stereocenters but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound and is optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at a stereocenter. Carbon-1 is a stereocenter because it is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` path of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path of the ring. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The name describes the all-cis isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol. This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through any C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring is a plane of symmetry. The presence of symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis**: We check the structure for any chiral centers. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no other stereocenters in the molecule. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe compounds that are optically active are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\nTo determine if a compound is optically active, we must assess if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore **optically inactive**. All candidate answers agree on this point.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors, `(3aR,7aS)`, indicating the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters. When a single enantiomer is named like this, it is by definition a pure chiral substance and is therefore **optically active**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, as the substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3. The specific `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or center of inversion depending on the conformation). This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is achiral despite having stereocenters. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**. All candidate answers agree.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. As a single, pure enantiomer, it is **optically active**. All candidate answers agree.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies a single enantiomer, `(R)`. Carbon 1 is a stereocenter as it's bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, and two different paths around the ring). A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**. All candidate answers agree.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is the only point of contention among the provided answers. However, a careful analysis of the molecule's stereoisomers reveals that both the all-cis isomer and the cis-trans isomer possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The all-cis isomer has three planes of symmetry.\n    *   The cis-trans isomer (e.g., 1,3-cis and 5-trans) has a plane of symmetry passing through the C5-OH bond and the C2 atom.\n    Since all possible stereoisomers of this compound are achiral due to symmetry, the compound itself is **optically inactive**. The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identified this. The minority view that the name implies a chiral isomer is incorrect, as no chiral stereoisomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol exists.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We must check for any stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, the rest of the chain, and two identical methyl groups. Since it has two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule, and it has an accessible conformation with a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**. All candidate answers agree.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is 3.

The correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\nThe core principle for determining optical activity is to assess whether a molecule is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. In most cases, this is due to the presence of one or more stereocenters (like a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The problem provides specific stereoisomers (indicated by Z, R, S, s notation), which means we are considering non-racemic samples.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The molecule has no stereocenters. The atoms involved in the double bond and those directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name provides the definitive information. The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. When a specific, single stereoisomer is named with R/S descriptors, it indicates that the molecule is chiral (unless it happens to be a meso compound, which is not the case for this complex, unsymmetrical structure). A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. It is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3), which are identically substituted. The specific configuration is `(2R, 3S)`, meaning they have opposite stereochemistry. This is a classic example of a *meso* compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a meso compound, it is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. This pair constitutes a set of enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. It is optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon at position 1 is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and 4) the `-CH=CH-CH2-` path around the ring. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. It is optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound is highly symmetrical. The most common interpretation of the name is the all-`cis` isomer, which has all three -OH groups on the same side of the ring. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom). Furthermore, the two other stereoisomers of this molecule are also achiral. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure:** `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis:** We must look for a stereocenter. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butane chain. This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-` group, and two identical methyl groups (`-CH3`). Since it has two identical groups attached, it is not a stereocenter. No other atom in the molecule is a stereocenter.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.

This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the question itself leads to the following conclusion.\n\nThe task is to determine how many of the seven listed chemical compounds are optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally requires the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's evaluate each compound systematically:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene with the structure `Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃`. The molecule is planar around the double bond, which constitutes a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which define the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters. When a name specifies a single, non-meso stereoisomer, it refers to a chiral molecule. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition **optically active**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. It has two identical stereocenters. The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes a meso compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry (in an eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in a staggered conformation). Meso compounds are achiral and **optically inactive**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The `(2R,3R)` isomer is chiral; its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is **optically active**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. Carbon 1 is a stereocenter because it is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, and two different paths around the ring). A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral. Since a single enantiomer is specified, it is **optically active**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This highly symmetrical molecule is achiral, regardless of the stereochemistry (all-cis or cis,trans). Both diastereomers possess planes of symmetry. For instance, the all-cis isomer has three planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and **optically inactive**. Almost all agents correctly identify this as inactive, with Answer 13 being a lone outlier based on a potentially flawed interpretation of the nomenclature. The structural reality of the molecule dictates that it is achiral.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. There are no stereocenters in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. The molecule is flexible and possesses accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and **optically inactive**.

    "**Analysis of Each Compound's Optical Activity**\n\nThe task is to determine how many of the given compounds are optically active. A compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a stereocenter and the absence of internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound based on this principle.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the `C=C` double bond and the atoms directly bonded to them are coplanar. This planarity creates a plane of symmetry within the molecule.

The molecule's complex bridged structure ensures it is not a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.** All candidate answers agree.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3) with identical substituents. The specific `(2R,3S)` configuration describes a *meso* compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion).\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.** All candidate answers agree.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks any internal symmetry elements. It is chiral, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.** All candidate answers agree.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: an -H, an -OH, and the two chemically distinct paths around the ring due to the double bond's position. Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies a single enantiomer, `(R)`.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.** All candidate answers agree.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This trisubstituted cyclohexane is highly symmetrical. Regardless of whether the hydroxyl groups are all-cis or if one is trans, all stereoisomers of this molecule possess a plane of symmetry. For instance, the all-cis isomer has three planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.** All candidate answers agree.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. A review of the structure reveals no stereocenters. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.** All candidate answers agree.\n\n**Final Count**\n\nThe following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, a total of **3** compounds are optically active.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 2\nC) 5\nD) 4\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

For a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (`R,S` or `S,R`) is a **meso compound**.

It is a diastereomer of the meso form. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` isomers are a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral because they lack any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   A single enantiomer is being described, so it is **optically active**.\n    *   All provided answers are in agreement.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, indicating a single enantiomer. Carbon C1 is a stereocenter as it is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, and the two different paths around the ring).\n    *   The molecule is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n    *   All provided answers are in agreement.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes a cyclohexane with three OH groups at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. The vast majority of the provided analyses correctly interpret this as referring to the most symmetric stereoisomer, the *all-cis* isomer.\n    *   The *all-cis* isomer possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring).

A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally requires the absence of any symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the `C=C` double bond and the atoms directly bonded to them are coplanar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule. The molecule has no stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. This R/S notation is used to define the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters. When a name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule (and it's not a meso compound, which is evident from its complex, asymmetric structure), that substance is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is therefore **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 and C3 are identical. For such molecules, the diastereomer with opposite stereochemical configurations (one R, one S) is a *meso* compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image, and thus achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a meso form, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. This pair constitutes a set of enantiomers. The name `(2R,3R)` refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. It is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Analysis:** The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer. The source of chirality is the carbon atom at position 1 (C1), which is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different due to the asymmetric location of the double bond relative to C1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. It is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound, regardless of the stereoisomer, is achiral. Let's consider the two possible diastereomers. The all-cis isomer has a high degree of symmetry, including three planes of symmetry, making it achiral. The other diastereomer (one hydroxyl trans to the other two) also has a plane of symmetry that passes through the trans hydroxyl group, its carbon, and the opposite `CH2` group. Since all stereoisomers of this molecule are achiral, the compound is optically inactive.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. We search for stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to one hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the chain. Since it has two identical methyl groups attached, it is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters or other sources of chirality in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nIn total, there are **3** optically active compounds.

This plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself specifies a single stereoisomer with absolute configurations `(3aR, 7aS)` at two chiral centers. A specific, single enantiomer of a chiral molecule is by definition **optically active**. The complex structure lacks symmetry, so it is not a meso compound.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), but its overall structure is symmetric. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a meso compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Meso compounds are achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` stereoisomer does not possess an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. As a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, and the two different paths around the ring: `-CH2-CH=` vs. `-CH=CH-CH2-`). It is therefore a stereocenter. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer of a chiral molecule. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, regardless of the stereoisomer, possesses a high degree of symmetry. Both the all-cis and the cis,cis,trans isomers of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol have a plane of symmetry.

Meso compounds possess stereocenters but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry). Achiral compounds are not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, existing as an enantiomeric pair with the `(2S,3S)` isomer.

The molecule is chiral, and the name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation usually describes the relative stereochemistry where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through the C1-OH bond and the opposite C4 atom, bisecting the molecule. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes it achiral.

We must check for stereocenters. The carbon in the `CH(CH₃)₂` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter.

This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The primary test for chirality is the absence of any improper axis of rotation (Sₙ), which includes planes of symmetry (σ) and centers of inversion (i). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃`. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. It is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This R/S notation is used to specify the absolute configuration of specific stereocenters. A molecule for which a specific, single enantiomer is named (and is not a meso compound) is by definition chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters (C2 and C3), which have identical substituents. For such a symmetric molecule, the stereoisomer with opposite configurations (one R, one S) is a **meso compound**. A meso compound possesses internal symmetry (a center of inversion in this case) and is therefore achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have any internal symmetry elements. Its mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` isomer, is non-superimposable. It is a chiral molecule, and a pure sample of the single enantiomer `(2R,3R)` is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies a single enantiomer, the `(R)` isomer. The carbon at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter as it is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH₂-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH₂-` part of the ring. Since a single enantiomer of a chiral compound is named, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation usually implies the all-*cis* isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It possesses multiple planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH₂ group). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We need to check for stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen atom and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters in the molecule. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral.

However, the molecule is symmetric because the substituents on both stereocenters are identical. For such molecules, the stereoisomer with opposite configurations (`R,S` or `S,R`) is a meso compound. A meso compound has an internal element of symmetry (like a plane or center of inversion) that makes it achiral, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Meso compound, therefore achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Analysis:** This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` isomers are enantiomers. They are chiral as they lack any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.

The source of chirality is C1, which is a stereocenter bonded to four different groups: `-H`, `-OH`, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Analysis:** The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` is non-standard but is widely interpreted to mean that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the CH₂ group opposite it) and a C₃ axis of rotation. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure:** `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis:** We check for stereocenters. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups and thus is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters in the molecule. The molecule has an accessible conformation with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe compounds that are optically active are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Analysis of Each Compound's Optical Activity**\n\nTo determine if a compound is optically active, we must assess if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule is an alkene.

This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), but the substituents on each are identical. The `(2R, 3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). Meso compounds are not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule whose mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at carbon C1. C1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: an -H, an -OH, and two different paths around the ring due to the asymmetrically placed double bond (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name refers to a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This highly symmetric molecule possesses several planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through any C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring). The presence of symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We need to search for a chiral center (a carbon with four different groups). The only potential candidate is C3 of the butan-1-one chain, which is `CH(CH3)2`.

Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, meaning the substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3. In such cases, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (`R,S` or `S,R`) is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral due to internal symmetry (e.g., a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) and is therefore **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, existing as an enantiomer to the `(2S,3S)` form. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at a stereocenter (C1). Carbon 1 is a stereocenter because it's bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, and the two different paths around the ring containing the double bond. Since a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule is specified, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name represents a symmetrically substituted cyclohexane. The most common interpretation refers to the *all-cis* isomer. This molecule is highly symmetric and possesses multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through C1-OH and the opposite C4 atom). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore **not optically active**. Although the naming is non-standard, the most logical interpretation leads to an achiral structure.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We must check for any chiral centers. The only potential candidate, C3 of the butane chain, is bonded to a hydrogen, the rest of the chain, and two identical methyl groups.

The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore **optically inactive**. All candidate answers agree on this point.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors, `(3aR,7aS)`, indicating the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters. When a single enantiomer is named like this, it is by definition a pure chiral substance and is therefore **optically active**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, as the substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3. The specific `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or center of inversion depending on the conformation). This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is achiral despite having stereocenters. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**. All candidate answers agree.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above.

Carbon 1 is a stereocenter as it's bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, and two different paths around the ring). A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**. All candidate answers agree.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is the only point of contention among the provided answers. However, a careful analysis of the molecule's stereoisomers reveals that both the all-cis isomer and the cis-trans isomer possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The all-cis isomer has three planes of symmetry.\n    *   The cis-trans isomer (e.g., 1,3-cis and 5-trans) has a plane of symmetry passing through the C5-OH bond and the C2 atom.\n    Since all possible stereoisomers of this compound are achiral due to symmetry, the compound itself is **optically inactive**.

The correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\nThe core principle for determining optical activity is to assess whether a molecule is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. In most cases, this is due to the presence of one or more stereocenters (like a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The problem provides specific stereoisomers (indicated by Z, R, S, s notation), which means we are considering non-racemic samples.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The molecule has no stereocenters. The atoms involved in the double bond and those directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name provides the definitive information. The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. When a specific, single stereoisomer is named with R/S descriptors, it indicates that the molecule is chiral (unless it happens to be a meso compound, which is not the case for this complex, unsymmetrical structure). A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. It is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3), which are identically substituted. The specific configuration is `(2R, 3S)`, meaning they have opposite stereochemistry. This is a classic example of a *meso* compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a meso compound, it is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. This pair constitutes a set of enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. It is optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon at position 1 is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and 4) the `-CH=CH-CH2-` path around the ring. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. It is optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound is highly symmetrical. The most common interpretation of the name is the all-`cis` isomer, which has all three -OH groups on the same side of the ring. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom). Furthermore, the two other stereoisomers of this molecule are also achiral. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure:** `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis:** We must look for a stereocenter. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butane chain. This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-` group, and two identical methyl groups (`-CH3`). Since it has two identical groups attached, it is not a stereocenter. No other atom in the molecule is a stereocenter.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of each compound is required to determine if it is chiral and therefore optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, which means it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is a key indicator of chirality.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   This molecule is an alkene. The atoms surrounding the carbon-carbon double bond are essentially coplanar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule.\n    *   There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral**, therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. This notation is used to specify the absolute configuration at chiral centers.\n    *   Naming a specific, single enantiomer of a compound indicates that the molecule is chiral and exists in non-superimposable mirror-image forms. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is always optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral**, therefore optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), and the substituents on each stereocenter are identical.\n    *   The `(2R, 3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound, despite having stereocenters, is achiral because it possesses an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that makes it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral (meso)**, therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The stereocenters have the same configuration `(R,R)`.\n    *   This isomer lacks any internal symmetry elements. It is the non-superimposable mirror image of the `(S,S)` isomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral**, therefore optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) `-OH`, 2) `-H`, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral**, therefore optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name refers to a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane. The most logical interpretation is the *all-cis* isomer. This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   It possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the molecule into two identical halves.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. (Note: All stereoisomers of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol are achiral).\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral**, therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`\n    *   We search for any chiral centers. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to one hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other stereocenters in the molecule. It is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral**, therefore optically inactive.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThis gives a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the question itself leads to the following conclusion.\n\nThe task is to determine how many of the seven listed chemical compounds are optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally requires the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's evaluate each compound systematically:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene with the structure `Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃`. The molecule is planar around the double bond, which constitutes a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which define the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters. When a name specifies a single, non-meso stereoisomer, it refers to a chiral molecule. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition **optically active**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. It has two identical stereocenters. The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes a meso compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry (in an eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in a staggered conformation). Meso compounds are achiral and **optically inactive**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The `(2R,3R)` isomer is chiral; its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is **optically active**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. Carbon 1 is a stereocenter because it is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, and two different paths around the ring). A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral. Since a single enantiomer is specified, it is **optically active**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This highly symmetrical molecule is achiral, regardless of the stereochemistry (all-cis or cis,trans). Both diastereomers possess planes of symmetry. For instance, the all-cis isomer has three planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and **optically inactive**. Almost all agents correctly identify this as inactive, with Answer 13 being a lone outlier based on a potentially flawed interpretation of the nomenclature. The structural reality of the molecule dictates that it is achiral.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. There are no stereocenters in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. The molecule is flexible and possesses accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and **optically inactive**. All candidate answers agree on this.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. The corresponding choice is B.\n\nIt is worth noting that while the reasoning in most candidate answers correctly identified 3 active compounds, many of them produced a contradictory final letter. The sound chemical reasoning points consistently to 3.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of optically active compounds. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which means it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is an alkene. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that is co-planar with the atoms of the double bond. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. A specific, single enantiomer of a chiral compound is named.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3) that have identical substituents. The `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer is a *meso* compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` isomers are a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). As a single enantiomer, this compound is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter, as it's bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` path of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path of the ring. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The name likely refers to the *all-cis* isomer. This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can be drawn through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom, reflecting the left side of the molecule onto the right side. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Other diastereomers of this compound are also achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis**: There are no stereocenters in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. The molecule is flexible and has conformations with a plane of symmetry. It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. Matching this to the options:\nA) 5\nB) 3\nC) 4\nD) 2\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
