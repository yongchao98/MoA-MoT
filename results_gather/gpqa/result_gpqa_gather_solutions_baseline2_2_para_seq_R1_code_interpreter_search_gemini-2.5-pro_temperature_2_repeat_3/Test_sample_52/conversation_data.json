I will systematically analyze the given information to deduce the elemental composition.\n\n**1. Break Down the Spectroscopic Information**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This establishes a benzene ring core with two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. This core fragment is **C6H4**.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an \"ester group\" (-COO-) is confirmed. This accounts for **2 oxygen atoms** and a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This is consistent with the 4 protons on the C6H4 core being in two different chemical environments (e.g., in a para-substituted ring). This confirms the **4 hydrogens** on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This is a classic fingerprint pattern. A doublet of quartets (dq) arises when a proton is split by one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and by three protons of a methyl group (giving the quartet). A simple doublet arises when a proton is split by only one adjacent proton. This pattern unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: One of these signals belongs to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment we just identified. Therefore, there must be a second, distinct methyl group somewhere else in the structure. This fragment contributes **3 hydrogens** and **1 carbon**.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a critical constraint. It tells us that the second methyl group must be part of the ester in a way that avoids forming a CH2 group. The only simple way to achieve this is to have a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-O-CO-CH3**).\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula**\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 from the aromatic ring (C6H4)\n    *   3 from the propenyl group (-C3H5)\n    *   1 from the ester's carbonyl carbon (-CO-)\n    *   1 from the second methyl group (-CH3)\n    *   **Total C = 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   4 from the aromatic ring (C6H4)\n    *   5 from the propenyl group (-C3H5)\n    *   3 from the second methyl group (-CH3)\n    *   **Total H = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   2 from the ester group (-COO-)\n    *   **Total O = 2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verify with the Provided Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the choices:\n*   **A) C11H12O2**\n*   B) C12H14O2\n*   C) C11H14O2\n*   D) C12H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, perfectly matches option A. All other options are inconsistent with the number of carbon and/or hydrogen atoms determined from the spectroscopic evidence. For example, any formula with 14 hydrogens would require either removing a double bond (which would eliminate the vinyl signals) or adding CH2 groups (which are explicitly absent). Any formula with 12 carbons cannot be constructed from the identified fragments.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Structure:** \"Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached, which can be represented by the formula **C6H4**.\n    *   **FTIR:** An \"ester group\" is present. This functional group (-COO-) accounts for **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **Crucial Constraint:** The 1H NMR spectrum has \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\" This is a key piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as ethyl or propyl groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify the Substituents:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 protons on the ring. The fact that they show up as two distinct signals is consistent with the C6H4 core, often seen in para (1,4) substitution patterns. This fragment contributes **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a highly characteristic splitting pattern that points unequivocally to a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The specific coupling between the two vinyl protons and between one vinyl proton and the adjacent methyl group creates this signature. This substituent contributes **C3H5** (2 vinyl protons + 3 methyl protons).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (2 signals):** One of the methyl signals is accounted for by the propenyl group. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. Given the \"no -CH2\" rule, this confirms the ester is a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an acetate-type ester (-O-CO-CH3). Both possibilities contribute the same number of atoms.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Final Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified pieces of the molecule:\n    *   **Aromatic Core:** C6H4\n    *   **Substituent 1 (Propenyl):** C3H5\n    *   **Substituent 2 (Ester part with methyl):** This fragment, be it -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3, contributes C2H3O2.\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verification:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** Let's calculate the DBE for C11H12O2.\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The structural features we identified also have a DBE of 6: one aromatic ring (4 DBE), one vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE), and one ester C=O double bond (1 DBE). The matching DBE confirms our analysis.\n    *   Comparing our derived formula C11H12O2 to the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction of the chemical formula from spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Fragments from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Core Structure (from question description and NMR):** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring core where two hydrogens have been replaced. The formula for this core is **C6H4**. The 1H NMR confirms this by showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which is typical for a 1,4-disubstituted ring containing 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **Atom Count:** C=6, H=4\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The data indicates an **ester group** (-COO-). This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the formula and contributes a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum (fragment analysis):**\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence that eliminates any structures with methylene bridges.\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals (\"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\"):** This is a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The specific splitting pattern arises from the coupling between the two vinyl protons and between one vinyl proton and the adjacent methyl group. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n        *   **Atom Count:** C=3, H=5\n    *   **–CH3 signals (two signals):**\n        1.  One methyl signal belongs to the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) we just identified.\n        2.  The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. Because there are no -CH2- groups, it must be a simple methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, the fragment contributing the second methyl group and the ester functionality has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n        *   **Atom Count:** C=2, H=3, O=2\n\n**2. Assembling the Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **Core (Aromatic Ring):** C6H4\n*   **Substituent 1 (Propenyl):** C3H5\n*   **Substituent 2 (Ester + Methyl):** C2H3O2\n\n**Total Sum:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe derived molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Matching the Formula to the Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived formula to the given options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) **C11H12O2**\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe only formula that matches the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n**Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**\n*   **Formula (C11H12O2):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**\nThe DoU calculation is consistent, confirming our conclusion.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula. The process involves breaking down the molecule into fragments based on the data and then reassembling them to find the total atom count.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Core and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. This gives a `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **FTIR: \"ester group\"**: This confirms the presence of a `-COO-` functional group. This group contains two oxygen atoms, which matches the `O2` in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data for Side Chains:**\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a critical constraint. It eliminates any fragments like ethyl (`-CH2CH3`), propyl (`-CH2CH2CH3`), etc.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons (`C6H4`). The presence of only two signals for these four protons is consistent with a symmetric substitution pattern (like 1,4-para substitution). This confirms the `C6H4` fragment contributes **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This very specific splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**.\n        *   The vinyl proton next to the `-CH3` group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three `-CH3` protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   This fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`) contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We have identified the two sources of methyl groups:\n        1.  One `-CH3` is part of the propenyl group.\n        2.  The other `-CH3` must be part of the ester group. Due to the \"no -CH2\" rule, this confirms the ester is a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). This fragment contributes **2 carbons**, **3 hydrogens**, and **2 oxygens**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Total Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from `C6H4` ring) + 3 (from propenyl `C3H5`) + 2 (from methyl ester `C2H3O2`) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from `C6H4` ring) + 5 (from propenyl `C3H5`) + 3 (from methyl ester `C2H3O2`) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from methyl ester `C2H3O2`) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n4.  **Final Formula and Verification:**\n    The assembled molecular formula is **C11H12O2**. Let's verify this against the options.\n    *   **A) C11H12O2** - Matches our calculation.\n    *   B) C11H14O2 - Incorrect hydrogen count. Would imply no vinyl C=C bond, contradicting the NMR.\n    *   C) C12H12O2 - Incorrect carbon count.\n    *   D) C12H14O2 - Incorrect carbon and hydrogen counts. Would require adding a CH2 group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data and the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Core Structure Identification:**\n    *   The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This identifies the core structure as a benzene ring with two substituents. The ring itself accounts for a **C₆H₄** fragment. The four hydrogens on the ring are confirmed by the \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" in the ¹H NMR, which is a common pattern for symmetrically substituted benzene rings (like 1,4-disubstitution).\n\n2.  **Functional Group Identification (FTIR & NMR):**\n    *   **FTIR:** Confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** found in all the options.\n    *   **¹H NMR (Protons):**\n        *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence that severely restricts the structure of the substituents. They cannot be simple alkyl chains like ethyl or propyl.\n        *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** The molecule contains two chemically distinct methyl groups.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**.\n            *   The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\".\n            *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\".\n            *   This propenyl group fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   We have identified the following fragments:\n        1.  Aromatic ring core: **C₆H₄**\n        2.  A propenyl substituent: **C₃H₅**\n    *   The remaining pieces are the ester group (`-COO-`) and the second `-CH₃` group. Due to the \"no -CH₂\" rule, this second methyl group must be directly part of the ester, forming a substituent like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`). Both of these have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n    *   We now sum the atoms from all fragments:\n        *   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n        *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n        *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2**\n    *   The derived chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verification with Options:**\n    *   The calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option A in the provided list.\n    *   Let's check the other options for consistency:\n        *   `C₁₁H₁₄O₂` (Option D): This has two extra hydrogens, which would require the removal of a double bond. This contradicts the NMR data showing vinyl protons.\n        *   `C₁₂H₁₂O₂` (Option C) and `C₁₂H₁₄O₂` (Option B): These formulas contain 12 carbons. Adding another carbon to the structure derived (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) while adhering to the NMR constraints (especially \"no -CH₂\") is not possible. For example, changing a methyl to an ethyl would add a CH₂ group, which is explicitly ruled out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from all candidate answers, and from an independent analysis of the data, is that the chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This is the only formula that is fully consistent with the di-substituted aromatic ring structure, the presence of an ester, and the specific ¹H NMR signals for a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and the absence of any methylene groups. According to the list provided in the question, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data provided, all candidate agents unanimously and correctly deduced the molecular formula. Here is a summary of the conclusive reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify Molecular Fragments from Data:**\n    *   **Core Structure**: The \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" implies a **C₆H₄** core. The ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals for aromatic-H\" is consistent with the 4 hydrogens on this core.\n    *   **Propenyl Group**: The ¹H NMR signals for vinyl-H described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is a definitive fingerprint for a **-CH=CH-CH₃** (propenyl) group. This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Group**: The FTIR data indicates an ester group (-COO-), and the ¹H NMR shows a second -CH₃ signal. Crucially, the NMR also shows **no signals for –CH₂ groups**. This eliminates esters like ethyl esters (-COOCH₂CH₃). The only way to incorporate the second methyl group and the ester functionality without a -CH₂- group is to have a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetoxy group (**-OCOCH₃**). In both cases, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble Fragments to Calculate Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Match to Provided Options:**\n    The derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, must be compared to the given choices:\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    The calculated formula perfectly matches option A. The other options are incorrect as they either have the wrong atom counts or would violate the spectral data (e.g., C₁₂H₁₄O₂ would necessitate a -CH₂- group, which is explicitly absent).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of all provided answers shows that their reasoning is sound and they all converge on the same chemical formula, even though their final letter choice may differ due to inconsistencies in how the options were listed. I will perform my own step-by-step analysis to confirm their shared conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided Information\nFirst, we break down each piece of spectral and structural information to identify the molecular fragments.\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. The fragment formula for this core is **C6H4**.\n*   **FTIR: Ester group:** This confirms the presence of an ester functional group (-COO-). This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the molecule.\n*   **1H NMR signals:** This gives us the most detailed information about the hydrogen-containing fragments.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This is consistent with the 4 protons on the C6H4 ring, likely in a symmetric para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) arrangement. This accounts for **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This is a classic and highly informative splitting pattern. A \"doublet of quartets\" arises when a proton is split by one adjacent proton (doublet) and three equivalent protons on a methyl group (quartet). This pattern unequivocally points to a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**. This fragment accounts for **5 hydrogens** (2 vinyl + 3 methyl) and **3 carbons**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We have already identified one methyl group as part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl signal must belong to the other substituent.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It means that the second methyl group is not part of a longer alkyl chain like an ethyl group. Given that this group must also be part of the ester, it is most likely a **methyl ester (`-COOCH3`)** or an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`). In either case, this fragment adds a **methyl group (`-CH3`)**, which accounts for **3 hydrogens** and **2 carbons** (one from the methyl, one from the carbonyl).\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula\nNow we sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the complete molecular formula.\n*   **Fragments:**\n    1.  Aromatic ring core: **C6H4**\n    2.  Propenyl group: **C3H5**\n    3.  Ester + second methyl group: **C2H3O2**\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with the Options\nWe now compare our derived formula with the choices given in the question:\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nOur derived formula, C11H12O2, exactly matches option A. The other options are inconsistent with the data. For example, C11H14O2 would require the saturation of the propenyl group's C=C bond, which would eliminate the vinyl-H signals and introduce -CH2- signals, both contradicting the NMR data. The options with 12 carbons cannot be constructed from the identified fragments.\n\nThe reasoning provided by all candidate agents is correct; the variation in their final letter choice is due to differently ordered option lists. The correct chemical formula based on the data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the reasoning provided by the various agents, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the molecular formula. The logic is sound and consistently applied.\n\nHere is a summary of the definitive deductive steps:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Analysis:** The \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" correctly identifies a **C6H4** fragment in the molecule. This contributes 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Vinyl Group Analysis:** The ¹H NMR signals for vinyl protons, specifically \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets,\" is a classic and unambiguous pattern for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`H-C=C-H + -CH3`). This also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals mentioned.\n\n3.  **Ester and Methyl Group Analysis:**\n    *   The FTIR confirms an ester group (`-COO-`), accounting for **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The ¹H NMR confirms a second methyl (`-CH3`) group signal.\n    *   The crucial piece of information \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\" rules out ethyl or larger alkyl chains on the ester. Therefore, the second methyl group must be part of the ester itself, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n    *   This fragment, in either isomeric form, contributes **2 carbons** and **3 hydrogens** to the total count.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon Count:** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen Count:** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** **2 Oxygens**\n\n5.  **Final Formula and Verification:**\n    *   The deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n    *   To double-check, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for this formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   This perfectly matches the unsaturation from the identified structural components: 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = 6.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\n*   **A) C11H12O2**\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C12H14O2\n*   D) C11H14O2\n\nThe only formula that matches the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of spectroscopic data to determine a chemical formula. All provided answers follow a similar logical path, which gives high confidence in the result.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Data\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means the core of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced. This fragment contributes a **C₆H₄** unit to the molecule. The presence of two aromatic signals in the NMR for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution like *para* (1,4), which is consistent with the C₆H₄ unit.\n\n2.  **FTIR Data**: The spectrum indicates an **ester group** (R-COO-R'). This confirms the presence of **two oxygen atoms** in the molecule. All four options have O₂, so this is consistent. The ester's carbonyl group (C=O) also contributes one degree of unsaturation.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Data Analysis (The most crucial part)**:\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals**: This is a key constraint. It eliminates any structure containing methylene groups, such as ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) or propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) groups.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH₃**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), giving a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, giving a **doublet**.\n        *   This fragment accounts for a **C₃H₅** unit and contains a C=C double bond (one degree of unsaturation).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups**:\n        *   One of these methyl signals belongs to the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`).\n        *   The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. Given the \"no -CH₂\" rule, this can only be part of a **methyl ester** (`-COOCH₃`) or an **acetate group** (`-O-CO-CH₃`). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Assembling the Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can deduce the total molecular formula:\n*   **From the aromatic ring**: C₆H₄\n*   **From the propenyl substituent**: C₃H₅\n*   **From the ester substituent**: C₂H₃O₂\n\nAdding them together:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: **2**\n\nThe deduced chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Verification\n\n*   **Total Hydrogens**: The hydrogen count can also be confirmed directly from the NMR assignments: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = 12 H. This rules out options A (C₁₁H₁₄O₂) and B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂).\n*   **Total Carbons**: The carbon count derived (11 C) rules out option C (C₁₂H₁₂O₂).\n*   **Final Formula**: The only option consistent with the data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**: The DBE for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is `11 - 12/2 + 1 = 6`. This matches the structural requirements: 4 for the benzene ring + 1 for the vinyl C=C + 1 for the ester C=O.\n\nAll 15 candidate answers, despite some inconsistencies in labeling the final choice as A, B, C, or D, correctly perform this analysis and unanimously arrive at the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This corresponds to option D in the original question's list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula, taking into account all the careful points from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided Information\nFirst, we'll break down each piece of spectroscopic and structural data to identify the fragments of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means the molecule contains a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced. The formula for this core is **C6H4**.\n\n2.  **FTIR Data**: The spectrum shows the presence of an **ester group (-COO-)**. This tells us the molecule contains **2 oxygen atoms**. An ester also has a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n3.  **1H NMR Data**: This provides the most detailed information about the molecule's structure.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups**: This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It rules out common structural units like ethyl groups (`-CH2CH3`) or propyl groups (`-CH2CH2CH3`).\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H**: This is consistent with the 4 hydrogens on the C6H4 core being in two different chemical environments, which is typical for a 1,4- (para) or 1,2- (ortho) disubstituted ring with two different substituents. This accounts for **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**.\n        *   The proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by one vinyl proton (making it a doublet) and three methyl protons (making it a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This fragment has the formula **C3H5** and accounts for one of the methyl groups.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups**:\n        *   One signal belongs to the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The other signal must belong to the ester functionality. Since there are no -CH2- groups, it must be a methyl group directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). This fragment contains the other **-CH3** group.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula\nNow we will sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon Atoms (C):**\n    *   6 from the aromatic ring (`C6`H4)\n    *   3 from the propenyl group (`C3`H5)\n    *   2 from the ester fragment (e.g., `-COOCH3` contributes one carbonyl `C` and one methyl `C`)\n    *   **Total C = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogen Atoms (H):**\n    *   4 from the aromatic ring (C6`H4`)\n    *   5 from the propenyl group (C3`H5`)\n    *   3 from the methyl group of the ester fragment (-CH`3`)\n    *   **Total H = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygen Atoms (O):**\n    *   2 from the ester group (`-COO-`)\n    *   **Total O = 2**\n\nCombining these totals, the deduced chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\nThe DBE confirms the consistency between the formula and the structure.\n*   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O bond (1 DBE) = **6 DBE**.\n*   **From the formula (C11H12O2):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DBE**.\nThe values match perfectly, confirming our conclusion.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Options\nThe derived formula, C11H12O2, must be compared with the choices provided in the question:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula, taking into account the provided information and the reasoning of the various agents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**:\n    *   **Core Structure**: \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means the base of the molecule is a benzene ring with two hydrogens replaced. The formula for this core is **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum**: \"ester group\". This indicates the presence of a `–COO–` functional group, which means the molecule contains **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: This provides the most detailed clues about the hydrogen environment.\n        *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups**: This is a critical constraint, ruling out structures with ethyl, propyl, or other methylene-containing fragments.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H**: This is consistent with the **4 hydrogens** on the C₆H₄ ring. The two distinct signals suggest a symmetric substitution pattern like 1,4-para.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**.\n            *   The proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first, resulting in a **doublet**.\n            *   This fragment accounts for **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens**.\n        *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups**:\n            *   One methyl group signal is from the propenyl group (`–CH=CH–**CH₃**`).\n            *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Because of the \"no –CH₂\" rule, this can only be a methyl ester (`–COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`–OCOCH₃`). In either case, the fragment contributes a `CH₃` group and the ester's carbonyl carbon `C=O`.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula**:\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified pieces:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring**: C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Substituent**: C₃H₅\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Substituent** (e.g., `-COOCH₃`): C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Summing the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O)**: **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verification**:\n    *   **Hydrogen Count**: The ¹H NMR confirms 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (methyl 1) + 3 (methyl 2) = **12 Hydrogens**. This immediately rules out options with 14 hydrogens.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**: For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, DBE = C - H/2 + 1 = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 6. The proposed structure contains a benzene ring (4 DBEs), a C=C bond (1 DBE), and a C=O bond (1 DBE), for a total of 6 DBEs. The calculation is consistent.\n\n4.  **Match to Options**:\n    The derived formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Let's compare this to the provided list of options:\n    A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n    B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n\nThe correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the reasoning provided by the 15 agents, I have come to a definitive conclusion.\n\n### Analysis of the Reasoning Process\n\nThe core task is to deduce a molecular formula from a set of spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR). I will outline the key logical steps that were consistently and correctly applied across almost all the candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data:** This is the most crucial part of the problem.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring Fragment:** The \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" correctly leads to the conclusion of a **C6H4** core. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Propenyl Group Fragment:** The signature NMR splitting pattern of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" for two vinyl protons is correctly identified by all agents as a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment contributes **C3H5**.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** The data specifies \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". One of these is part of the propenyl group.\n    *   **Ester Fragment:** The second -CH3 signal, combined with the \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\" rule and the FTIR data showing an ester, correctly leads to the conclusion that the ester substituent is either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH3). Both possibilities contribute the same number of atoms to the formula: **C2H3O2**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments:**\n    The consensus is to sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   Core Ring: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (Propenyl): C3H5\n    *   Substituent 2 (Ester part): C2H3O2\n    *   **Total Carbon:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogen:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygen:** 0 + 0 + 2 = **2**\n\n3.  **Conclusion of the Formula:**\n    The logical deduction from all spectroscopic data points overwhelmingly to the molecular formula **C11H12O2**. The scientific reasoning presented by all 15 agents is sound and leads to this same result.\n\n4.  **Final Mapping to Options:**\n    The last step is to match this derived formula to the given list of options:\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct formula, C11H12O2, corresponds to option D. While many of the agents made a clerical error in selecting the final letter, their underlying chemical reasoning was correct. The analysis is consistent and robust.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe task is to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data. I will systematically analyze each piece of information to assemble the molecular fragments and calculate the final formula.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the core structure and functional groups.**\n*   **\"Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 hydrogen atoms and 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR \"ester group\":** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR data to identify the substituents and count the hydrogen atoms.**\n*   **\"Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\":** This is consistent with the C6H4 core, which has 4 aromatic protons. Their appearance as two signals suggests a specific substitution pattern (e.g., para).\n*   **\"Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\":** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The proton on the double-bonded carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, while the other vinyl proton is split into a simple doublet. This fragment contributes `C3H5` to the formula (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n*   **\"Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\":** One of these methyl signals is accounted for by the propenyl group. Therefore, there must be a second, distinct methyl group (`-CH3`) in the molecule.\n*   **\"No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\":** This is a crucial constraint. It means that the second methyl group cannot be part of a larger alkyl chain like an ethyl group. It must be a methyl group attached directly to the ester (as in `-COOCH3`) or the ring.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the molecular fragments and calculate the total number of atoms.**\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  An aromatic ring core: **C6H4**\n2.  A propenyl substituent: **C3H5**\n3.  An ester substituent containing the second methyl group (e.g., `-COOCH3`): **C2H3O2**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe final deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the deduced formula with the given options.**\nThe question provides the following options:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H12O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a problem of structural elucidation using spectroscopic data. A step-by-step analysis is required to determine the molecular formula by identifying all the fragments of the molecule.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Core and Functional Groups:**\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the molecule contains a C6H4 group as its core. This accounts for **6 Carbon atoms** and **4 Hydrogen atoms**.\n*   **FTIR - Ester group:** An ester (R-COO-R') contains **2 Oxygen atoms**. All provided options have O2, which is consistent.\n\n**2. Detailed Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\nThis is the most critical part for determining the full structure and atom counts.\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This corresponds to the **4 Hydrogen atoms** on the C6H4 core. Having only two signals implies a symmetric substitution pattern, likely 1,4-disubstitution.\n*   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a textbook signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**.\n    *   Let's label the protons: `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n    *   The H(a) signal is split only by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   The H(b) signal is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   This fragment perfectly matches the data. It contains **3 Carbon atoms** and **5 Hydrogen atoms** (2 vinyl H + 3 methyl H).\n*   **–CH3 groups (2 signals):**\n    *   One of these signals belongs to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   The other signal must come from the second substituent.\n*   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. The second substituent (the ester) cannot contain a methylene bridge. Since it must also account for the second -CH3 signal, it must be a methyl ester group (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH3`). Both possibilities contribute a **-CH3** fragment. The `CO` or `OCO` parts come from the ester functional group. This fragment has a formula of **C2H3O2**.\n\n**3.

    "Based on a systematic analysis of the provided information and the reasoning from all candidate answers, the chemical formula can be definitively determined. The reasoning across all candidates is exceptionally consistent and logically sound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis, highlighting the careful points required to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The information \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" immediately establishes a core fragment of **C₆H₄**. The ¹H NMR data corroborates this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which is characteristic of the 4 protons remaining on such a ring.\n    *   *Contribution:* 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Functional Groups:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an **ester group (-COO-)**, which accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** seen in all the options. This also introduces a C=O double bond.\n\n3.  **Decode the Substituents with ¹H NMR:** The NMR data provides the most critical clues for identifying the two substituents on the ring.\n    *   **The Propenyl Group:** The signal description \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" is a textbook signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.\n        *   The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by its vinyl neighbor (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\".\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\".\n        *   This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **The Second Methyl Group and the Ester:** The NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\". Having assigned one to the propenyl group, the other must belong to the ester.\n    *   **The Power of Negative Information:** The crucial clue is **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a substituent like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`). Both of these fragments contribute **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula:** By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can calculate the total formula:\n    *   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester part)\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen:** 0 + 0 + 2 = **2**\n    *   The final, deduced formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The DBE for the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is `11 - (12/2) + 1 = 6`. This perfectly matches the DBE from the identified structure: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (C=C double bond) + 1 (C=O double bond) = 6. The result is self-consistent.\n    *   **Matching with Options:** Comparing the derived formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** to the options provided:\n        *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n        *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n        *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n        *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe calculated formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

I will systematically analyze the given information to deduce the elemental composition.\n\n**1. Break Down the Spectroscopic Information**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This establishes a benzene ring core with two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. This core fragment is **C6H4**.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an \"ester group\" (-COO-) is confirmed. This accounts for **2 oxygen atoms** and a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This is consistent with the 4 protons on the C6H4 core being in two different chemical environments (e.g., in a para-substituted ring). This confirms the **4 hydrogens** on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This is a classic fingerprint pattern. A doublet of quartets (dq) arises when a proton is split by one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and by three protons of a methyl group (giving the quartet). A simple doublet arises when a proton is split by only one adjacent proton. This pattern unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: One of these signals belongs to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment we just identified. Therefore, there must be a second, distinct methyl group somewhere else in the structure. This fragment contributes **3 hydrogens** and **1 carbon**.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a critical constraint. It tells us that the second methyl group must be part of the ester in a way that avoids forming a CH2 group. The only simple way to achieve this is to have a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-O-CO-CH3**).\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula**\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 from the aromatic ring (C6H4)\n    *   3 from the propenyl group (-C3H5)\n    *   1 from the ester's carbonyl carbon (-CO-)\n    *   1 from the second methyl group (-CH3)\n    *   **Total C = 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   4 from the aromatic ring (C6H4)\n    *   5 from the propenyl group (-C3H5)\n    *   3 from the second methyl group (-CH3)\n    *   **Total H = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   2 from the ester group (-COO-)\n    *   **Total O = 2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verify with the Provided Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the choices:\n*   **A) C11H12O2**\n*   B) C12H14O2\n*   C) C11H14O2\n*   D) C12H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, perfectly matches option A. All other options are inconsistent with the number of carbon and/or hydrogen atoms determined from the spectroscopic evidence. For example, any formula with 14 hydrogens would require either removing a double bond (which would eliminate the vinyl signals) or adding CH2 groups (which are explicitly absent). Any formula with 12 carbons cannot be constructed from the identified fragments.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Structure:** \"Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached, which can be represented by the formula **C6H4**.\n    *   **FTIR:** An \"ester group\" is present. This functional group (-COO-) accounts for **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **Crucial Constraint:** The 1H NMR spectrum has \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\" This is a key piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as ethyl or propyl groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify the Substituents:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 protons on the ring. The fact that they show up as two distinct signals is consistent with the C6H4 core, often seen in para (1,4) substitution patterns. This fragment contributes **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a highly characteristic splitting pattern that points unequivocally to a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The specific coupling between the two vinyl protons and between one vinyl proton and the adjacent methyl group creates this signature. This substituent contributes **C3H5** (2 vinyl protons + 3 methyl protons).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (2 signals):** One of the methyl signals is accounted for by the propenyl group. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. Given the \"no -CH2\" rule, this confirms the ester is a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an acetate-type ester (-O-CO-CH3). Both possibilities contribute the same number of atoms.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Final Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified pieces of the molecule:\n    *   **Aromatic Core:** C6H4\n    *   **Substituent 1 (Propenyl):** C3H5\n    *   **Substituent 2 (Ester part with methyl):** This fragment, be it -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3, contributes C2H3O2.\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verification:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** Let's calculate the DBE for C11H12O2.\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The structural features we identified also have a DBE of 6: one aromatic ring (4 DBE), one vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE), and one ester C=O double bond (1 DBE). The matching DBE confirms our analysis.\n    *   Comparing our derived formula C11H12O2 to the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction of the chemical formula from spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Fragments from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Core Structure (from question description and NMR):** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring core where two hydrogens have been replaced. The formula for this core is **C6H4**. The 1H NMR confirms this by showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which is typical for a 1,4-disubstituted ring containing 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **Atom Count:** C=6, H=4\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The data indicates an **ester group** (-COO-). This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the formula and contributes a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum (fragment analysis):**\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence that eliminates any structures with methylene bridges.\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals (\"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\"):** This is a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The specific splitting pattern arises from the coupling between the two vinyl protons and between one vinyl proton and the adjacent methyl group. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n        *   **Atom Count:** C=3, H=5\n    *   **–CH3 signals (two signals):**\n        1.  One methyl signal belongs to the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) we just identified.\n        2.  The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. Because there are no -CH2- groups, it must be a simple methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, the fragment contributing the second methyl group and the ester functionality has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n        *   **Atom Count:** C=2, H=3, O=2\n\n**2. Assembling the Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **Core (Aromatic Ring):** C6H4\n*   **Substituent 1 (Propenyl):** C3H5\n*   **Substituent 2 (Ester + Methyl):** C2H3O2\n\n**Total Sum:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe derived molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Matching the Formula to the Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived formula to the given options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) **C11H12O2**\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe only formula that matches the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n**Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**\n*   **Formula (C11H12O2):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**\nThe DoU calculation is consistent, confirming our conclusion.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula. The process involves breaking down the molecule into fragments based on the data and then reassembling them to find the total atom count.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Core and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. This gives a `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **FTIR: \"ester group\"**: This confirms the presence of a `-COO-` functional group. This group contains two oxygen atoms, which matches the `O2` in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data for Side Chains:**\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a critical constraint. It eliminates any fragments like ethyl (`-CH2CH3`), propyl (`-CH2CH2CH3`), etc.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons (`C6H4`). The presence of only two signals for these four protons is consistent with a symmetric substitution pattern (like 1,4-para substitution). This confirms the `C6H4` fragment contributes **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This very specific splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**.\n        *   The vinyl proton next to the `-CH3` group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three `-CH3` protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   This fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`) contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We have identified the two sources of methyl groups:\n        1.  One `-CH3` is part of the propenyl group.\n        2.  The other `-CH3` must be part of the ester group. Due to the \"no -CH2\" rule, this confirms the ester is a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). This fragment contributes **2 carbons**, **3 hydrogens**, and **2 oxygens**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Total Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from `C6H4` ring) + 3 (from propenyl `C3H5`) + 2 (from methyl ester `C2H3O2`) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from `C6H4` ring) + 5 (from propenyl `C3H5`) + 3 (from methyl ester `C2H3O2`) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from methyl ester `C2H3O2`) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n4.  **Final Formula and Verification:**\n    The assembled molecular formula is **C11H12O2**. Let's verify this against the options.\n    *   **A) C11H12O2** - Matches our calculation.\n    *   B) C11H14O2 - Incorrect hydrogen count. Would imply no vinyl C=C bond, contradicting the NMR.\n    *   C) C12H12O2 - Incorrect carbon count.\n    *   D) C12H14O2 - Incorrect carbon and hydrogen counts. Would require adding a CH2 group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data and the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Core Structure Identification:**\n    *   The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This identifies the core structure as a benzene ring with two substituents. The ring itself accounts for a **C₆H₄** fragment. The four hydrogens on the ring are confirmed by the \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" in the ¹H NMR, which is a common pattern for symmetrically substituted benzene rings (like 1,4-disubstitution).\n\n2.  **Functional Group Identification (FTIR & NMR):**\n    *   **FTIR:** Confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** found in all the options.\n    *   **¹H NMR (Protons):**\n        *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence that severely restricts the structure of the substituents. They cannot be simple alkyl chains like ethyl or propyl.\n        *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** The molecule contains two chemically distinct methyl groups.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**.\n            *   The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\".\n            *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\".\n            *   This propenyl group fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   We have identified the following fragments:\n        1.  Aromatic ring core: **C₆H₄**\n        2.  A propenyl substituent: **C₃H₅**\n    *   The remaining pieces are the ester group (`-COO-`) and the second `-CH₃` group. Due to the \"no -CH₂\" rule, this second methyl group must be directly part of the ester, forming a substituent like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`). Both of these have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n    *   We now sum the atoms from all fragments:\n        *   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n        *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n        *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2**\n    *   The derived chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verification with Options:**\n    *   The calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option A in the provided list.\n    *   Let's check the other options for consistency:\n        *   `C₁₁H₁₄O₂` (Option D): This has two extra hydrogens, which would require the removal of a double bond. This contradicts the NMR data showing vinyl protons.\n        *   `C₁₂H₁₂O₂` (Option C) and `C₁₂H₁₄O₂` (Option B): These formulas contain 12 carbons. Adding another carbon to the structure derived (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) while adhering to the NMR constraints (especially \"no -CH₂\") is not possible. For example, changing a methyl to an ethyl would add a CH₂ group, which is explicitly ruled out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from all candidate answers, and from an independent analysis of the data, is that the chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This is the only formula that is fully consistent with the di-substituted aromatic ring structure, the presence of an ester, and the specific ¹H NMR signals for a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and the absence of any methylene groups. According to the list provided in the question, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data provided, all candidate agents unanimously and correctly deduced the molecular formula. Here is a summary of the conclusive reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify Molecular Fragments from Data:**\n    *   **Core Structure**: The \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" implies a **C₆H₄** core. The ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals for aromatic-H\" is consistent with the 4 hydrogens on this core.\n    *   **Propenyl Group**: The ¹H NMR signals for vinyl-H described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is a definitive fingerprint for a **-CH=CH-CH₃** (propenyl) group. This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Group**: The FTIR data indicates an ester group (-COO-), and the ¹H NMR shows a second -CH₃ signal. Crucially, the NMR also shows **no signals for –CH₂ groups**. This eliminates esters like ethyl esters (-COOCH₂CH₃). The only way to incorporate the second methyl group and the ester functionality without a -CH₂- group is to have a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetoxy group (**-OCOCH₃**). In both cases, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble Fragments to Calculate Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Match to Provided Options:**\n    The derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, must be compared to the given choices:\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    The calculated formula perfectly matches option A. The other options are incorrect as they either have the wrong atom counts or would violate the spectral data (e.g., C₁₂H₁₄O₂ would necessitate a -CH₂- group, which is explicitly absent).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of all provided answers shows that their reasoning is sound and they all converge on the same chemical formula, even though their final letter choice may differ due to inconsistencies in how the options were listed. I will perform my own step-by-step analysis to confirm their shared conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided Information\nFirst, we break down each piece of spectral and structural information to identify the molecular fragments.\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. The fragment formula for this core is **C6H4**.\n*   **FTIR: Ester group:** This confirms the presence of an ester functional group (-COO-). This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the molecule.\n*   **1H NMR signals:** This gives us the most detailed information about the hydrogen-containing fragments.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This is consistent with the 4 protons on the C6H4 ring, likely in a symmetric para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) arrangement. This accounts for **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This is a classic and highly informative splitting pattern. A \"doublet of quartets\" arises when a proton is split by one adjacent proton (doublet) and three equivalent protons on a methyl group (quartet). This pattern unequivocally points to a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**. This fragment accounts for **5 hydrogens** (2 vinyl + 3 methyl) and **3 carbons**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We have already identified one methyl group as part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl signal must belong to the other substituent.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It means that the second methyl group is not part of a longer alkyl chain like an ethyl group. Given that this group must also be part of the ester, it is most likely a **methyl ester (`-COOCH3`)** or an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`). In either case, this fragment adds a **methyl group (`-CH3`)**, which accounts for **3 hydrogens** and **2 carbons** (one from the methyl, one from the carbonyl).\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula\nNow we sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the complete molecular formula.\n*   **Fragments:**\n    1.  Aromatic ring core: **C6H4**\n    2.  Propenyl group: **C3H5**\n    3.  Ester + second methyl group: **C2H3O2**\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with the Options\nWe now compare our derived formula with the choices given in the question:\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nOur derived formula, C11H12O2, exactly matches option A. The other options are inconsistent with the data. For example, C11H14O2 would require the saturation of the propenyl group's C=C bond, which would eliminate the vinyl-H signals and introduce -CH2- signals, both contradicting the NMR data. The options with 12 carbons cannot be constructed from the identified fragments.\n\nThe reasoning provided by all candidate agents is correct; the variation in their final letter choice is due to differently ordered option lists. The correct chemical formula based on the data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the reasoning provided by the various agents, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the molecular formula. The logic is sound and consistently applied.\n\nHere is a summary of the definitive deductive steps:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Analysis:** The \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" correctly identifies a **C6H4** fragment in the molecule. This contributes 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Vinyl Group Analysis:** The ¹H NMR signals for vinyl protons, specifically \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets,\" is a classic and unambiguous pattern for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`H-C=C-H + -CH3`). This also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals mentioned.\n\n3.  **Ester and Methyl Group Analysis:**\n    *   The FTIR confirms an ester group (`-COO-`), accounting for **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The ¹H NMR confirms a second methyl (`-CH3`) group signal.\n    *   The crucial piece of information \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\" rules out ethyl or larger alkyl chains on the ester. Therefore, the second methyl group must be part of the ester itself, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n    *   This fragment, in either isomeric form, contributes **2 carbons** and **3 hydrogens** to the total count.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon Count:** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen Count:** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** **2 Oxygens**\n\n5.  **Final Formula and Verification:**\n    *   The deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n    *   To double-check, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for this formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   This perfectly matches the unsaturation from the identified structural components: 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = 6.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\n*   **A) C11H12O2**\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C12H14O2\n*   D) C11H14O2\n\nThe only formula that matches the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of spectroscopic data to determine a chemical formula. All provided answers follow a similar logical path, which gives high confidence in the result.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Data\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means the core of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced. This fragment contributes a **C₆H₄** unit to the molecule. The presence of two aromatic signals in the NMR for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution like *para* (1,4), which is consistent with the C₆H₄ unit.\n\n2.  **FTIR Data**: The spectrum indicates an **ester group** (R-COO-R'). This confirms the presence of **two oxygen atoms** in the molecule. All four options have O₂, so this is consistent. The ester's carbonyl group (C=O) also contributes one degree of unsaturation.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Data Analysis (The most crucial part)**:\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals**: This is a key constraint. It eliminates any structure containing methylene groups, such as ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) or propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) groups.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH₃**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), giving a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, giving a **doublet**.\n        *   This fragment accounts for a **C₃H₅** unit and contains a C=C double bond (one degree of unsaturation).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups**:\n        *   One of these methyl signals belongs to the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`).\n        *   The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. Given the \"no -CH₂\" rule, this can only be part of a **methyl ester** (`-COOCH₃`) or an **acetate group** (`-O-CO-CH₃`). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Assembling the Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can deduce the total molecular formula:\n*   **From the aromatic ring**: C₆H₄\n*   **From the propenyl substituent**: C₃H₅\n*   **From the ester substituent**: C₂H₃O₂\n\nAdding them together:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: **2**\n\nThe deduced chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Verification\n\n*   **Total Hydrogens**: The hydrogen count can also be confirmed directly from the NMR assignments: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = 12 H. This rules out options A (C₁₁H₁₄O₂) and B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂).\n*   **Total Carbons**: The carbon count derived (11 C) rules out option C (C₁₂H₁₂O₂).\n*   **Final Formula**: The only option consistent with the data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**: The DBE for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is `11 - 12/2 + 1 = 6`. This matches the structural requirements: 4 for the benzene ring + 1 for the vinyl C=C + 1 for the ester C=O.\n\nAll 15 candidate answers, despite some inconsistencies in labeling the final choice as A, B, C, or D, correctly perform this analysis and unanimously arrive at the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This corresponds to option D in the original question's list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula, taking into account all the careful points from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided Information\nFirst, we'll break down each piece of spectroscopic and structural data to identify the fragments of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means the molecule contains a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced. The formula for this core is **C6H4**.\n\n2.  **FTIR Data**: The spectrum shows the presence of an **ester group (-COO-)**. This tells us the molecule contains **2 oxygen atoms**. An ester also has a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n3.  **1H NMR Data**: This provides the most detailed information about the molecule's structure.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups**: This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It rules out common structural units like ethyl groups (`-CH2CH3`) or propyl groups (`-CH2CH2CH3`).\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H**: This is consistent with the 4 hydrogens on the C6H4 core being in two different chemical environments, which is typical for a 1,4- (para) or 1,2- (ortho) disubstituted ring with two different substituents. This accounts for **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**.\n        *   The proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by one vinyl proton (making it a doublet) and three methyl protons (making it a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This fragment has the formula **C3H5** and accounts for one of the methyl groups.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups**:\n        *   One signal belongs to the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The other signal must belong to the ester functionality. Since there are no -CH2- groups, it must be a methyl group directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). This fragment contains the other **-CH3** group.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula\nNow we will sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon Atoms (C):**\n    *   6 from the aromatic ring (`C6`H4)\n    *   3 from the propenyl group (`C3`H5)\n    *   2 from the ester fragment (e.g., `-COOCH3` contributes one carbonyl `C` and one methyl `C`)\n    *   **Total C = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogen Atoms (H):**\n    *   4 from the aromatic ring (C6`H4`)\n    *   5 from the propenyl group (C3`H5`)\n    *   3 from the methyl group of the ester fragment (-CH`3`)\n    *   **Total H = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygen Atoms (O):**\n    *   2 from the ester group (`-COO-`)\n    *   **Total O = 2**\n\nCombining these totals, the deduced chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\nThe DBE confirms the consistency between the formula and the structure.\n*   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O bond (1 DBE) = **6 DBE**.\n*   **From the formula (C11H12O2):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DBE**.\nThe values match perfectly, confirming our conclusion.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Options\nThe derived formula, C11H12O2, must be compared with the choices provided in the question:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula, taking into account the provided information and the reasoning of the various agents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**:\n    *   **Core Structure**: \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means the base of the molecule is a benzene ring with two hydrogens replaced. The formula for this core is **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum**: \"ester group\". This indicates the presence of a `–COO–` functional group, which means the molecule contains **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: This provides the most detailed clues about the hydrogen environment.\n        *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups**: This is a critical constraint, ruling out structures with ethyl, propyl, or other methylene-containing fragments.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H**: This is consistent with the **4 hydrogens** on the C₆H₄ ring. The two distinct signals suggest a symmetric substitution pattern like 1,4-para.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**.\n            *   The proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first, resulting in a **doublet**.\n            *   This fragment accounts for **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens**.\n        *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups**:\n            *   One methyl group signal is from the propenyl group (`–CH=CH–**CH₃**`).\n            *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Because of the \"no –CH₂\" rule, this can only be a methyl ester (`–COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`–OCOCH₃`). In either case, the fragment contributes a `CH₃` group and the ester's carbonyl carbon `C=O`.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula**:\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified pieces:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring**: C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Substituent**: C₃H₅\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Substituent** (e.g., `-COOCH₃`): C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Summing the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O)**: **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verification**:\n    *   **Hydrogen Count**: The ¹H NMR confirms 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (methyl 1) + 3 (methyl 2) = **12 Hydrogens**. This immediately rules out options with 14 hydrogens.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**: For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, DBE = C - H/2 + 1 = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 6. The proposed structure contains a benzene ring (4 DBEs), a C=C bond (1 DBE), and a C=O bond (1 DBE), for a total of 6 DBEs. The calculation is consistent.\n\n4.  **Match to Options**:\n    The derived formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Let's compare this to the provided list of options:\n    A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n    B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n\nThe correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the reasoning provided by the 15 agents, I have come to a definitive conclusion.\n\n### Analysis of the Reasoning Process\n\nThe core task is to deduce a molecular formula from a set of spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR). I will outline the key logical steps that were consistently and correctly applied across almost all the candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data:** This is the most crucial part of the problem.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring Fragment:** The \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" correctly leads to the conclusion of a **C6H4** core. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Propenyl Group Fragment:** The signature NMR splitting pattern of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" for two vinyl protons is correctly identified by all agents as a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment contributes **C3H5**.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** The data specifies \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". One of these is part of the propenyl group.\n    *   **Ester Fragment:** The second -CH3 signal, combined with the \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\" rule and the FTIR data showing an ester, correctly leads to the conclusion that the ester substituent is either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH3). Both possibilities contribute the same number of atoms to the formula: **C2H3O2**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments:**\n    The consensus is to sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   Core Ring: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (Propenyl): C3H5\n    *   Substituent 2 (Ester part): C2H3O2\n    *   **Total Carbon:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogen:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygen:** 0 + 0 + 2 = **2**\n\n3.  **Conclusion of the Formula:**\n    The logical deduction from all spectroscopic data points overwhelmingly to the molecular formula **C11H12O2**. The scientific reasoning presented by all 15 agents is sound and leads to this same result.\n\n4.  **Final Mapping to Options:**\n    The last step is to match this derived formula to the given list of options:\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct formula, C11H12O2, corresponds to option D. While many of the agents made a clerical error in selecting the final letter, their underlying chemical reasoning was correct. The analysis is consistent and robust.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe task is to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data. I will systematically analyze each piece of information to assemble the molecular fragments and calculate the final formula.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the core structure and functional groups.**\n*   **\"Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 hydrogen atoms and 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR \"ester group\":** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR data to identify the substituents and count the hydrogen atoms.**\n*   **\"Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\":** This is consistent with the C6H4 core, which has 4 aromatic protons. Their appearance as two signals suggests a specific substitution pattern (e.g., para).\n*   **\"Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\":** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The proton on the double-bonded carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, while the other vinyl proton is split into a simple doublet. This fragment contributes `C3H5` to the formula (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n*   **\"Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\":** One of these methyl signals is accounted for by the propenyl group. Therefore, there must be a second, distinct methyl group (`-CH3`) in the molecule.\n*   **\"No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\":** This is a crucial constraint. It means that the second methyl group cannot be part of a larger alkyl chain like an ethyl group. It must be a methyl group attached directly to the ester (as in `-COOCH3`) or the ring.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the molecular fragments and calculate the total number of atoms.**\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  An aromatic ring core: **C6H4**\n2.  A propenyl substituent: **C3H5**\n3.  An ester substituent containing the second methyl group (e.g., `-COOCH3`): **C2H3O2**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe final deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the deduced formula with the given options.**\nThe question provides the following options:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H12O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a problem of structural elucidation using spectroscopic data. A step-by-step analysis is required to determine the molecular formula by identifying all the fragments of the molecule.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Core and Functional Groups:**\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the molecule contains a C6H4 group as its core. This accounts for **6 Carbon atoms** and **4 Hydrogen atoms**.\n*   **FTIR - Ester group:** An ester (R-COO-R') contains **2 Oxygen atoms**. All provided options have O2, which is consistent.\n\n**2. Detailed Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\nThis is the most critical part for determining the full structure and atom counts.\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This corresponds to the **4 Hydrogen atoms** on the C6H4 core. Having only two signals implies a symmetric substitution pattern, likely 1,4-disubstitution.\n*   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a textbook signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**.\n    *   Let's label the protons: `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n    *   The H(a) signal is split only by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   The H(b) signal is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   This fragment perfectly matches the data. It contains **3 Carbon atoms** and **5 Hydrogen atoms** (2 vinyl H + 3 methyl H).\n*   **–CH3 groups (2 signals):**\n    *   One of these signals belongs to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   The other signal must come from the second substituent.\n*   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. The second substituent (the ester) cannot contain a methylene bridge. Since it must also account for the second -CH3 signal, it must be a methyl ester group (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH3`). Both possibilities contribute a **-CH3** fragment. The `CO` or `OCO` parts come from the ester functional group. This fragment has a formula of **C2H3O2**.\n\n**3. Assembling the Fragments and Calculating the Formula:**\nLet's sum the atoms from all the identified pieces:\n*   **Ring Core:** C6H4\n*   **Propenyl Substituent:** C3H5\n*   **Ester Substituent:** C2H3O2\n\n**Summation:**\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester part) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (ester) = **2**\n\nThe deduced chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Matching with Options:**\nLet's compare this result to the choices provided in the question:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H12O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe problem is a classic structure elucidation task where we need to assemble the molecular formula by piecing together information from the given data. All candidate answers follow a very similar and correct logical path.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Fragment (C6H4):** The description \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" from the ¹H NMR data points to a C6H4 core. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic hydrogens, and two signals for these protons strongly suggests a symmetric substitution pattern (like para, 1,4-disubstitution).\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** C6, H4\n\n2.  **Propenyl Group Fragment (C3H5):** The ¹H NMR data is key here. \"Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" is a highly characteristic signature for a `-CH=CH-CH3` group (a propenyl group).\n    *   Let's label the protons: Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n    *   Proton H(a) is split only by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   Proton H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   This fragment perfectly matches the description and also accounts for one of the two methyl (-CH3) signals.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** C3, H5 (1 H(a) + 1 H(b) + 3 from CH3)\n\n3.  **Ester/Methyl Fragment (C2H3O2):**\n    *   The FTIR data confirms an ester group (-COO-), which contains **two Oxygen atoms** and a carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The ¹H NMR specifies there are *two* methyl (-CH3) signals. We've already assigned one to the propenyl group. The second must belong to the ester group.\n    *   A critical clue is \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". This eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). The only simple way to have an ester with a methyl group and no CH2 group is to have a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`).\n    *   This methyl ester substituent (`-COOCH3`) contributes a carbonyl carbon, a methyl carbon, three hydrogens, and two oxygens.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** C2, H3, O2\n\n**Synthesizing the Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n\nThe final deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Matching to Options**\n\nWe now compare this result to the provided options:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D. All the candidate answers correctly reasoned their way to this formula, with differences in the final letter being attributable to variations in the options list they were given.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
