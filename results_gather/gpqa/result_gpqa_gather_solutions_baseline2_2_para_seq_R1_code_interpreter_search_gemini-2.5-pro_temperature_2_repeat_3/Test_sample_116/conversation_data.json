A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The two main causes of chirality discussed in the candidate answers are the presence of a chiral center and axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Consensus on Each Compound:** I will review the reasoning provided by the 15 candidate answers for each compound.\n\n    *   **Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate):**\n        *   All 15 agents provide a consistent and correct analysis. They all identify this as a substituted biphenyl. They correctly point out that the four large substituents in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') cause severe steric hindrance, which restricts free rotation around the central C-C single bond. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which leads to axial chirality. They unanimously conclude that the molecule is chiral and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate):**\n        *   All 15 agents again provide a consistent and correct analysis. They identify the carbon at position 2 as a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃. They unanimously conclude that the presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n    *   **Compound 3 (benzophenone):**\n        *   All 15 agents correctly identify this molecule as achiral. Their reasoning is that it lacks a chiral center and, more importantly, possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. They unanimously conclude that benzophenone is not optically active.\n\n    *   **Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate):**\n        *   All 15 agents correctly identify this molecule as achiral. They note that the molecule is planar (which implies a plane of symmetry) and that it also possesses a center of inversion. They unanimously conclude that dimethyl fumarate is not optically active.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Final Conclusion from the Consensus:**\n    *   Based on the unanimous and scientifically sound reasoning provided by all 15 agents, compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Match the Conclusion to the Given Options:**\n    The conclusion is that only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

Therefore, the decision is based on the strong consensus of the analytical reasoning.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of each compound is required to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically happens when a molecule lacks key symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **Analysis of compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single bond.\n    *   In biphenyls, bulky substituents at the four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') can prevent free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings.

Understand the Core Scientific Question**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four listed compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The main ways to identify chirality are by looking for:\n*   A chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n*   Axial chirality due to restricted rotation (atropisomerism), common in substituted biphenyls.\n*   The absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** A biphenyl derivative with bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four positions ortho to the bond connecting the rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify that these bulky groups cause severe steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation around the central single bond. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. The resulting fixed, non-planar conformation lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral. It will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** An ester with the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group) as a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. It will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** A ketone with two phenyl rings attached to a carbonyl carbon, (C₆H₅)₂CO.\n    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly note that this molecule has no chiral centers. More importantly, it possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the C=O bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** The dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* double bond: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify this molecule as being planar and possessing both a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral due to these symmetry elements. It will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3.

A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The two most common reasons for this are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (like atropisomerism).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Consensus on Each Compound:** I will review the analysis provided by the various agents for each of the four compounds.\n    *   **Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate):** There is a unanimous consensus across all 15 answers. Every agent correctly identifies this as a substituted biphenyl with bulky groups in the ortho positions. This leads to restricted rotation (atropisomerism), making the molecule non-planar and chiral. Therefore, Compound 1 shows optical isomerism.\n    *   **Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate):** There is also a unanimous consensus here. Every agent correctly identifies that the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3). This makes it a chiral center, and thus the molecule is chiral. Therefore, Compound 2 shows optical isomerism.\n    *   **Compound 3 (benzophenone):** Again, there is a complete consensus. All agents correctly state that benzophenone is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, Compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate):** The consensus is again unanimous. All agents correctly identify this molecule as planar and possessing both a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane) and a center of inversion. It is therefore achiral. Therefore, Compound 4 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Result:** Based on the unanimous scientific reasoning from all provided answers, the compounds that show optical isomerism are Compound 1 and Compound 2.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Final Options:**\n    *   The correct answer must include \"1 and 2\".\n    *   Option A is \"2 and 3\". Incorrect.\n    *   Option B is \"1 and 2\". Correct.\n    *   Option C is \"3 and 4\". Incorrect.\n    *   Option D is \"1, 2 and 4\". Incorrect.\n\n5.  **Address Discrepancies:** While the reasoning in all 15 answers is correct and leads to the conclusion that \"1 and 2\" is the answer, many of the agents have selected the wrong final letter (e.g., A, C, or D). This appears to be a clerical error in the final step of their process. The core chemical analysis is sound and consistently points to the same conclusion. Therefore, I will base the final answer on the correct chemical reasoning, not the erroneous letter choices made by some agents.\n\nThe correct conclusion, supported by the detailed reasoning of every agent, is that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The question asks to identify which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (atropisomerism). Conversely, a molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The key feature is the presence of bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four positions *ortho* to the bond connecting the rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The steric hindrance from these large groups prevents free rotation around the single bond. This phenomenon, known as atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** We look for a chiral center. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and it thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅, with a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule has no chiral centers. More importantly, it possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the C=O bond and bisect the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n5.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* geometry around the C=C double bond: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: Does NOT show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Does NOT show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn organic compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral.

Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The four bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at the *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond connecting them.

Understand the Scientific Principle**\nThe core task is to identify which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound will show optical isomerism if and only if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key ways to assess chirality are:\n*   **Absence of Symmetry:** A chiral molecule must not have a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n*   **Sources of Chirality:** Chirality often arises from a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or from a fixed, twisted molecular geometry (axial chirality, e.g., atropisomerism).\n\n**2. Systematically Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are bulky (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). Their size causes significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation is called **atropisomerism**. It locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We must check for a chiral center. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.

Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. The molecule does not have any chiral centers. More importantly, it is highly symmetrical. A plane of symmetry can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Due to the double bond, the molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral.

They correctly point out that the four large substituents in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') cause severe steric hindrance, which restricts free rotation around the central C-C single bond. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which leads to axial chirality. They unanimously conclude that the molecule is chiral and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate):**\n        *   All 15 agents again provide a consistent and correct analysis. They identify the carbon at position 2 as a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃. They unanimously conclude that the presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n    *   **Compound 3 (benzophenone):**\n        *   All 15 agents correctly identify this molecule as achiral. Their reasoning is that it lacks a chiral center and, more importantly, possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. They unanimously conclude that benzophenone is not optically active.\n\n    *   **Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate):**\n        *   All 15 agents correctly identify this molecule as achiral. They note that the molecule is planar (which implies a plane of symmetry) and that it also possesses a center of inversion. They unanimously conclude that dimethyl fumarate is not optically active.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Final Conclusion from the Consensus:**\n    *   Based on the unanimous and scientifically sound reasoning provided by all 15 agents, compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Match the Conclusion to the Given Options:**\n    The conclusion is that only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

Understand the Core Scientific Question**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four listed compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The main ways to identify chirality are by looking for:\n*   A chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n*   Axial chirality due to restricted rotation (atropisomerism), common in substituted biphenyls.\n*   The absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**2.

This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. The resulting fixed, non-planar conformation lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral. It will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** An ester with the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group) as a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. It will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** A ketone with two phenyl rings attached to a carbonyl carbon, (C₆H₅)₂CO.\n    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly note that this molecule has no chiral centers. More importantly, it possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the C=O bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** The dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* double bond: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify this molecule as being planar and possessing both a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral due to these symmetry elements.

A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The two most common reasons for this are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (like atropisomerism).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Consensus on Each Compound:** I will review the analysis provided by the various agents for each of the four compounds.\n    *   **Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate):** There is a unanimous consensus across all 15 answers. Every agent correctly identifies this as a substituted biphenyl with bulky groups in the ortho positions. This leads to restricted rotation (atropisomerism), making the molecule non-planar and chiral. Therefore, Compound 1 shows optical isomerism.\n    *   **Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate):** There is also a unanimous consensus here. Every agent correctly identifies that the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3). This makes it a chiral center, and thus the molecule is chiral. Therefore, Compound 2 shows optical isomerism.\n    *   **Compound 3 (benzophenone):** Again, there is a complete consensus. All agents correctly state that benzophenone is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, Compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate):** The consensus is again unanimous. All agents correctly identify this molecule as planar and possessing both a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane) and a center of inversion. It is therefore achiral. Therefore, Compound 4 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Result:** Based on the unanimous scientific reasoning from all provided answers, the compounds that show optical isomerism are Compound 1 and Compound 2.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Final Options:**\n    *   The correct answer must include \"1 and 2\".\n    *   Option A is \"2 and 3\". Incorrect.\n    *   Option B is \"1 and 2\". Correct.\n    *   Option C is \"3 and 4\". Incorrect.\n    *   Option D is \"1, 2 and 4\". Incorrect.\n\n5.  **Address Discrepancies:** While the reasoning in all 15 answers is correct and leads to the conclusion that \"1 and 2\" is the answer, many of the agents have selected the wrong final letter (e.g., A, C, or D). This appears to be a clerical error in the final step of their process. The core chemical analysis is sound and consistently points to the same conclusion.

Conversely, a molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The key feature is the presence of bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four positions *ortho* to the bond connecting the rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The steric hindrance from these large groups prevents free rotation around the single bond. This phenomenon, known as atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** We look for a chiral center.

The most common sources of chirality are a chiral center (an atom with four different substituents) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation, as in atropisomerism).\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl. The key feature is the presence of bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on all four *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   These bulky groups cause severe steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**.\n    *   This twisted molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it **chiral**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism. All candidate answers correctly identify this.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   We look for a chiral center. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is **chiral**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. All candidate answers correctly identify this.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl rings on the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   There are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 3 does not exhibit optical isomerism. All candidate answers correctly identify this.\n\n5.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the *trans* isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid (trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃).\n    *   The molecule is planar and highly symmetrical. It has both a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** (the midpoint of the C=C double bond).\n    *   The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 4 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically requires the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound with bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6').\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identify that the bulky ortho groups restrict rotation around the central C-C single bond. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which results in a stable, twisted, non-planar structure. This structure lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 1 is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identify that the carbon at position 2 is a **chiral center**.

This phenomenon, called **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation where the two rings are not in the same plane. This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Key Feature:** We need to look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        2.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        3.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        4.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Its formula is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making it achiral. Additionally, it possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds **1** (due to atropisomerism) and **2** (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will show optical isomerism.

A compound shows optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key features to look for are sources of chirality (like chiral centers or axial chirality) and the absence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n**2.

The four large substituents (nitro and methoxycarbonyl groups) at the ortho positions of the biphenyl system restrict free rotation around the central single bond. This locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Exhibits optical isomerism.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, possesses a **chiral center**.
