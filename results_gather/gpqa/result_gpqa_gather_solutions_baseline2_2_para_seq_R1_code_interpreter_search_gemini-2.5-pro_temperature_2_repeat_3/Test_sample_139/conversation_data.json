Converting to Celsius: 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that B is D₂O, and the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   **Gas W**: The gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. Since the system involves Deuterium, the most logical candidate for the gas is D₂. Each Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fulfilling the condition.\n    *   **Substance X and the Organic Chemistry Reaction**: The problem states that X (or its analog) is a common organic reagent. Critically, its reaction with a \"keto acid\" results in a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), meaning it has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid must be reduced to an alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom. Not all reducing agents can do this. A strong reducing agent like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is required. Milder agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) would fail to reduce the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Identifying X**: Since the analog is LiAlH₄, and Substance X must contain Deuterium, **X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Verify the Reaction Sequence with LiAlD₄**:\n    *   Let's assume the liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O) since that is the most plausible source of Deuterium for the other products.\n    *   **Reaction**: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It correctly produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It produces a precipitate, G. Aluminium hydroxide is a precipitate, so its deuterated analog, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), would also precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This reaction correctly releases Substance B (D₂O).\n    *   All the clues in the problem are consistent with the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n3.  **Perform the Final Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Atomic Number 3), Aluminium (Al, Atomic Number 13), and Hydrogen (H, Atomic Number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminium.\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements. The options are integers, so we will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n    *   **Mass of Lightest Element (Hydrogen)**: The molecule contains 4 atoms of Hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total Mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass of Heaviest Element (Aluminium)**: The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminium. Its stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total Mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   **Cumulative Mass** = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminium) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**:\n    The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly identify substance X as LiAlD₄ and perform the calculation to arrive at the value of 35. Comparing this calculated value to the provided options:\n    A) 25\n    B) 31\n    C) 35\n    D) 29\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis based on the reasoning provided by the candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Identification of Key Substances:**\n    *   There is a strong consensus among all answers that substance **B** is **D₂O (heavy water)**. This is based on its melting point being \"very close to 277 K\" (3.85 °C), which is the melting point of D₂O (3.82 °C).\n    *   There is also a strong consensus that gas **W** is **D₂ (deuterium gas)**. This is because its molecule needs to have an equal number of protons and neutrons (a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons), and its formation is consistent with a reaction involving D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identification of Substance X:**\n    *   All reasoning chains logically deduce that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   This conclusion is supported by multiple, consistent pieces of evidence:\n        *   It contains a heavy isotope (Deuterium).\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry.\n        *   It reacts violently with heavy water (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate. The precipitate is identified as Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which when heated would release D₂O, matching all clues.\n        *   It is a powerful enough reducing agent to reduce a keto acid (containing 3 oxygens) to a diol (containing 2 oxygens), as described in the problem.\n\n3.  **The Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest** element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest** element is Aluminium (Al).\n    *   All candidate answers correctly determine that the calculation should be:\n        (Total mass of Deuterium atoms) + (Total mass of Aluminium atoms)\n    *   Using integer mass numbers for the isotopes (as implied by the integer answers):\n        *   Mass of D = 2\n        *   Mass of Al = 27\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄, so there are 4 Deuterium atoms and 1 Aluminium atom.\n    *   Calculation: (4 × 2) + (1 × 27) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The reasoning from all candidate answers unanimously leads to the numerical result of **35**.\n    *   Reviewing the options:\n        *   A) 31\n        *   B) 29\n        *   C) 35\n        *   D) 25\n    *   The calculated value of 35 corresponds to option C. While many of the candidate answers contain a typo where they state the wrong letter for the correct numerical result, the logic itself is sound and consistently points to 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances**\n\nThe reasoning across nearly all candidate answers is consistent and logical in identifying the unknown substances:\n*   **Substance B:** Its melting point is ~277 K (3.85 °C). This is consistently identified as being very close to the melting point of **D₂O (heavy water)**, which is 3.82 °C.\n*   **Heavier Isotope:** The identification of B as D₂O leads to the conclusion that the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D)**.\n*   **Gas W:** The clue that the molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons strongly points to **D₂ gas**. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is the most chemically plausible answer in a system involving Deuterium.\n*   **Substance X:** Based on the chemical properties (powerful organic reducing agent, reacts violently with water/D₂O, forms a precipitate, reduces a keto acid to a product with 2 oxygens), the agents correctly deduce that **Substance X is LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)**. Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, fits the description of a widely used, powerful organic reagent. The reaction `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃↓ + LiOD + 4D₂↑` accounts for all observations, including the precipitate **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n\n**2. The Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄)\".\n*   **Elements in X:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (Atomic Number Z=13).\n*   The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements. Integer mass numbers are used, as implied by the integer options.\n    *   The mass of the isotope Deuterium (²H) is 2.\n    *   The mass of the stable isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) is 27.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (4 atoms of Deuterium): 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (1 atom of Aluminium): 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = **35**\n\n**3. Analysis of Candidate Answers and Final Decision**\n\nA clear majority of the candidate answers (Answers 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and others) correctly deduce that Substance X is LiAlD₄ and perform the calculation to arrive at the value **35**.\n\nWhile some agents select an incorrect letter (e.g., Answer 2 chooses B, Answer 4 chooses A), their own reasoning leads to the number 35. This suggests a simple mapping error. The consensus of the sound reasoning points unequivocally to the numerical answer of 35.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 29\nB) 31\nC) 25\nD) 35\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The key starting point is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Conversion to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (or 276.97 K).\n    *   This is an almost perfect match, so we can confidently identify **B as D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Isotope and Gas W:** The presence of D₂O indicates the \"heavier isotope\" in the problem is Deuterium (D, or ²H). The problem states that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the deuterium context, the most logical candidate is D₂ gas.\n    *   Each Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description, so we identify **W as D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** The properties of substance X lead to its identification.\n    *   **Reaction:** It reacts violently with a liquid (Y) to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G). To get pure D₂, the liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium, meaning **Y is D₂O**. The reaction is therefore `X + D₂O → G↓ + D₂↑`.\n    *   **Precipitate:** The precipitate G, when heated, releases D₂O. This suggests G is a metal deuteroxide, like Al(OD)₃, which decomposes on heating: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Clues:** X's \"very close analog\" is a common organic reagent, and X reduces a keto acid to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one from the ketone, two from the carboxylic acid). Reducing a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`) removes one oxygen atom. This requires a strong reducing agent. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous strong reducing agent; its analog Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) is not strong enough.\n    *   Therefore, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄, and Substance X, which contains deuterium, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verification:** The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)` fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (Al).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using integer mass numbers for the isotopes. Mass of D = 2. Mass of Al = 27.\n    *   Total mass from lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Total mass from heaviest element (Aluminium): There is 1 atom of Aluminium. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis calculated value of 35 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is based on a consensus of the reasoning provided by the different agents, focusing on the derivation of the solution rather than just the final letter choice, as there were discrepancies in mapping the calculated value to the options.\n\n**1. Identification of the Substances**\n*   **Substance B:** The melting point of B is ~277 K (3.85 °C). This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. All agents correctly identified B as D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved is Deuterium (D).\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that the system contains deuterium, the only logical candidate is D₂ gas. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This was a unanimous conclusion.\n*   **Substance X:** Based on the chemical properties (organic reagent, reduces a keto acid to a product with 2 oxygen atoms, reacts violently with a liquid Y to form a precipitate and D₂ gas), the agents correctly identified that X must be a strong deuterated reducing agent. The ability to reduce a carboxylic acid (part of the keto acid) points specifically to Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) as the analog. Therefore, Substance X, its deuterated version, is **LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n*   **Liquid Y and Precipitate G:** The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑` consistently explains all the clues. Liquid Y is D₂O, and the precipitate G is Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\n\n**2. Calculation**\nThe task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), Hydrogen (as isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest element (by atomic number):** Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Calculation:** The question requires summing the mass of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using their isotopic mass numbers.\n    *   There are **four** atoms of the lightest element (Deuterium, D). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   There is **one** atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium, Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nThe reasoning provided by all agents overwhelmingly and correctly leads to the calculated value of 35. This value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the final answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B.**\nThe problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D or ²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The given value is an excellent match for heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W.**\nThe problem states that gas W's molecule has \"the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   Since the presence of deuterium (D) is confirmed from Step 1, it's logical to consider gases made of hydrogen isotopes.\n*   A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) has 2 protons (1 from each atom) and 2 neutrons (1 from each atom). The number of protons and neutrons is equal.\n*   This fits the description perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X.**\n*   **Reaction Context:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope (now confirmed as D), reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O. This strongly implies that X is a reactive metal deuteride, Y is D₂O, and G is a metal deuteroxide.\n*   **Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n    1.  \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common reagent.\n    2.  \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group >C=O, and two in the carboxylic acid group -COOH). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid must be reduced to alcohol groups. A reagent powerful enough to do this is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n*   **Putting it together:** The \"close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Therefore, Substance X, which contains deuterium, must be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify LiAlD₄ against all clues.**\n*   **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n*   This reaction is famously violent.\n*   It produces D₂ gas (W), which matches our identification.\n*   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate (G).\n*   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`, which correctly yields B as D₂O.\n*   All clues are consistent with **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation.**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminium.\n*   We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **four** D atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **one** Al atom.\n*   **Cumulative Mass Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\nThe calculated value is 35. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 35\nB) 31\nC) 25\nD) 29\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances from Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The clue states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   277 K is equal to 3.85 °C (277 - 273.15).\n    *   This is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (deuterium oxide), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Normal water, H₂O, melts at 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   This is overwhelming evidence that **Substance B is D₂O**.\n    *   Consequently, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue is Deuterium (D or ²H), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The gas W is described as having molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Given the context of Deuterium, let's test Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   Each Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n    *   This confirms that **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G. Since all the products contain Deuterium (D₂ gas and a precipitate that yields D₂O), the liquid reactant Y must also be a source of deuterium. The most logical candidate for a liquid reagent in this context is **heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identification of Substance X**\n\n*   We need to find a deuterated compound (Substance X) that:\n    1.  Has an analog commonly used in organic chemistry.\n    2.  Reacts violently with D₂O to form D₂ gas and a precipitate (G).\n    3.  When reacted with a keto acid, yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n*   The clue about organic chemistry points towards common reducing agents. The most powerful common reducing agents are Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs are **LiAlD₄** and **NaBD₄**.\n\n*   Let's test these candidates:\n    *   **The keto acid reaction:** A keto acid has a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), totaling 3 oxygen atoms. The final product has only 2 oxygen atoms. This means the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to an alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). LiAlH₄ is strong enough for this reduction, but NaBH₄ is not. This points towards the analog being LiAlH₄, and thus **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **The precipitate reaction:** Let's verify the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O.\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n        In this reaction, Aluminum Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is insoluble and forms a precipitate (G). When G is heated, it decomposes to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B), matching all the clues. (A similar reaction with NaBD₄ would produce soluble products, so no precipitate would form).\n\n*   All evidence points conclusively to **Substance X = LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n\n**3. The Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   The substance is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   Based on atomic number or atomic mass, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** and the **heaviest element is Aluminium**.\n*   The question states to sum the masses of all instances of these elements in the molecule, using the mass numbers of the relevant isotopes.\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **4** atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **1** atom of Aluminium.\n*   Calculation:\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = **35**\n\n*   Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 35\n    B) 25\n    C) 29\n    D) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe process to solve this problem can be broken down into two main parts: first, identifying the unknown substance X based on a series of chemical clues, and second, performing the calculation as described.\n\n### Part 1: Identifying Substance X\n\n1.  **Melting Point of B:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\" (3.85 °C). This is a strong indicator of heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This implies the system involves deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n2.  **Gas W:** The gas W has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the presence of deuterium, the gas is almost certainly deuterium gas (D₂). A D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the clue perfectly.\n3.  **The Reaction:** A substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O (Substance B).\n    *   For the reaction to produce only D₂ gas and deuterated products, the liquid reactant Y must also be a source of deuterium. Thus, **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   G is a precipitate that releases D₂O upon heating, which is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)n) decomposing into a metal oxide and D₂O.\n4.  **Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n    *   The \"close analog\" of X is a common organic reagent. This suggests well-known reagents like LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄. The substance X would therefore be their deuterated counterparts, LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n    *   X reacts with a keto acid (which has ≥3 oxygen atoms) to produce a compound with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both the ketone (C=O) group and the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) is strong enough for this, whereas NaBH₄ is not. The reaction reduces the keto acid to a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups), which has exactly 2 oxygen atoms.\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity:** Based on all the clues, substance X must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   The reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G, precipitate) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W, gas)`.\n    *   Heating G (`Al(OD)₃`) produces D₂O (B). All conditions are met.\n\n### Part 2: Performing the Calculation\n\n1.  **The Goal:** Calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula for X is **LiAlD₄**.\n2.  **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest** element by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest** element by atomic number is Aluminium.\n3.  **Sum the Masses:** The problem specifies summing the masses of all instances of these elements, using the mass numbers of the relevant isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is one atom of Aluminium (²⁷Al). Its mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n4.  **Final Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the two totals = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) 31\nB) 35\nC) 29\nD) 25\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution based on the reasoning provided by the candidate agents:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The crucial starting point, identified correctly by nearly all agents, is the melting point of substance B, given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is very near the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), and distinct from normal water (H₂O) which melts at 0 °C.\n    *   Thus, **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W and the Core Chemistry:**\n    *   The identification of B as D₂O implies that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the reaction is Deuterium (D, or ²H).\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the deuterium context, the gas D₂ is the most logical candidate (1 proton + 1 neutron per atom, so the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce a precipitate (G) and D₂ gas (W). To get pure D₂ gas, the liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium, making **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   The clues state that X's analog is a common organic reagent and that X reduces a keto acid (which has ≥3 oxygen atoms) to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This points to a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is the prime candidate for the analog.\n    *   Therefore, Substance X must be its deuterated version: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   This is confirmed by the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G, precipitate) + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W, gas)`. All byproducts and reaction characteristics align with the problem statement. Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) yields D₂O (B).\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium (Al).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved: D = 2, Al = 27.\n    *   Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 25\n    B) 29\n    C) 35\n    D) 31\n    The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1. Deconstruction of Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\" (3.85 °C). This is an exact match for the melting point of heavy water, **D₂O** (3.82 °C or 276.97 K), and rules out normal water (H₂O, 0 °C). This is the key insight. The \"heavier isotope\" is therefore **Deuterium (D)**.\n*   **Gas W:** Gas W has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that the reaction involves deuterium, the most likely candidate is **D₂** (di-deuterium gas). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms (each with 1 proton and 1 neutron), for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   **Substances G and Y:** A precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide decomposing into a metal oxide and heavy water. The fact that the entire system is deuterated (producing D₂ and D₂O) means the reacting liquid Y is almost certainly **D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identification of Substance X using Organic Chemistry Clues**\n\n*   **Reagent Type:** Substance X and its \"very close analog\" are used in organic chemistry. This points to common laboratory reagents.\n*   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH) has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group, containing at least 3 oxygen atoms. For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, both functional groups must have been reduced to alcohols (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH), a diol).\n*   **Identifying the Reagent:** Only very strong reducing agents can reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids. Lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH₄) is famous for this, while milder reagents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) are not. The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, meaning Substance X, containing deuterium, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**3. Verification of all Steps**\n\n*   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all clues.\n*   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   The reaction is violent.\n    *   Gas W is D₂, which has equal protons and neutrons.\n    *   A precipitate G, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), is formed.\n    *   Heating G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) releases B (D₂O), which has a melting point of ~277 K.\n*   All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminium.\n*   We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotopic masses (mass numbers).\n    *   **Mass of all lightest element atoms:** There are four atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). Mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n    *   **Mass of all heaviest element atoms:** There is one atom of Aluminium (²⁷Al). Mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = **27**.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nBased on the options provided in the prompt's context, the value 35 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O, where D is the isotope deuterium, ²H) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   The match is nearly perfect, so we can confidently identify **Substance B as D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The clue states that gas W has molecules with an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Since we have identified D₂O, the system clearly involves the hydrogen isotope deuterium (D). Let's test D₂ gas.\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description, so we can identify **Gas W as D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Other Substances (X, Y, G):**\n    *   We know substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G.\n    *   Since the products involve deuterium (D₂), and B (released from G) is also D₂O, the system must be rich in deuterium. This implies that **liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   The reaction `X + D₂O → G (precipitate) + D₂ (gas)` involves a deuterated compound (X) reacting with heavy water.\n    *   Precipitate G releases D₂O (B) upon heating. This is a characteristic decomposition of a metal deuteroxide (`M(OD)n → Metal Oxide + D₂O`). So, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n4.  **Use Organic Chemistry Clues to Identify X:**\n    *   The clues state that X's \"very close analog\" is a common organic reagent and that X reduces a \"certain keto acid\" to a product containing only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   A keto acid (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH) has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to an alcohol group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   A common reagent capable of this powerful reduction is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   Therefore, the \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Substance X, containing the heavier isotope (D), must be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Complete Reaction:**\n    *   The proposed reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   This reaction is famously violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G), since aluminum hydroxide is insoluble.\n    *   Heating G (`Al(OD)₃`) produces `Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O` (B).\n    *   All clues align perfectly. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The question states to sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the formula.

This is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water, **D₂O** (3.82 °C), confirming that the heavy isotope involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Gas W:** The clue that its molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons strongly points to **D₂ gas** (2 protons, 2 neutrons), especially given the established presence of deuterium.\n    *   **Substance X:** The combined clues indicate that X is a deuterated compound, its analog is a powerful organic reducing agent (like LiAlH₄), it reacts violently with a protic solvent, and the reaction forms a precipitate.\n        *   The reaction with a keto acid (3 oxygens) yielding a product with 2 oxygens requires the reduction of both a ketone and a carboxylic acid, which points specifically to an analog of LiAlH₄, a very strong reducing agent.\n        *   Therefore, Substance X must be **LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n    *   **Substance Y and G:** For the reaction `LiAlD₄ + Y → D₂ + G (precipitate)` to work, Y must be **D₂O**. This leads to the reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → Al(OD)₃↓ + LiOD + 4 D₂↑`. This confirms that the precipitate G is **Al(OD)₃**. All clues are consistent with this identification.\n\n2.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements found in the formula LiAlD₄.

Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 35\n    B) 29\n    C) 31\n    D) 25\n\n    The correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the heavy isotope.**\nThe melting point of substance B is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value is an almost perfect match for heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n*   This implies that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**, which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W.**\nGas W is described as having molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   Since the reaction involves deuterium, the most likely gas produced is some form of hydrogen gas.\n*   Let's analyze D₂ (di-deuterium gas). A single deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A molecule of D₂ therefore has (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons.\n*   This perfectly fits the description. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X.**\nMultiple clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n*   **Reagent type:** Its \"very close analog\" is a common organic chemistry reagent. This points towards compounds like LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄. Since X contains a heavy isotope, the candidates are LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄.\n*   **Reaction products:** The reaction of X with liquid Y produces D₂ gas and a precipitate (G). Let's assume the liquid Y is D₂O to supply the deuterium needed for the products.\n    *   If X were LiAlD₄: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂`. This reaction produces a precipitate, which matches the clue. The precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), when heated, would decompose to release D₂O (Substance B), which is also consistent.\n    *   If X were NaBD₄: The reaction products with D₂O are soluble, so no precipitate would form. This rules out NaBD₄.\n*   **Reaction with keto acid:** X reacts with a keto acid (which has at least 3 oxygen atoms) to give a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This means both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups are reduced to alcohols. LiAlH₄ (the analog of X) is a strong enough reagent to do this, while NaBH₄ is not.\n\nAll clues converge to identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)**.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the final calculation.**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen, present as its isotope Deuterium (D).\n*   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminium (Al).\n*   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecular formula, using their integer mass numbers as implied by the answer choices.\n    *   Mass number of Deuterium (D, or ²H) = 2.\n    *   Mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n*   The formula LiAlD₄ contains one Aluminium atom and four Deuterium atoms.\n*   Mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   Mass from Hydrogen (Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   Cumulative sum = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the provided answers.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Substances based on Properties:**\n    *   **Substance B:** The melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\". This is 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), while normal water melts at 0 °C (273.15 K). This is a strong, almost certain indication that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Heavy Isotope:** The identification of D₂O means the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned is Deuterium (D, or ²H).\n    *   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Given the context of Deuterium, let's analyze Deuterium gas (D₂). A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect fit. **W is D₂**.\n    *   **Substance G & Liquid Y:** G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a typical decomposition of a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₙ). For this to be produced in a reaction with liquid Y, it is most logical that **Y is D₂O**. The reaction is thus: X + D₂O → G(precipitate) + W(D₂ gas).\n    *   **Substance X:** We know X contains Deuterium. The clues are:\n        1.  Its analog is a common organic chemistry reagent.\n        2.  It reduces a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a powerful reducing agent that can reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids, like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). The milder Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) would fail.\n        3.  The deuterated analog of LiAlH₄ is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        4.  Let's verify the precipitation: The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O is `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃(s) + LiOD(aq) + 4D₂(g)`. Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is indeed a precipitate (G).

Here is the synthesized, step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K.\"\n*   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This strongly indicates that **B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe gas W, produced in the reaction, has molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   Given the context of Deuterium, we analyze D₂ gas. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**.\n*   This matches the clue perfectly, making **W = D₂ gas**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\nA series of clues allows for the systematic identification of X:\n*   **The Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y to form gas D₂ and a precipitate G. For the reaction to yield pure D₂ gas, both X (a deuteride) and Y (a liquid) must be deuterium sources. Thus, **liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction of X with D₂O also forms the precipitate G.\n*   **The Precipitate G:** G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This confirms G is a deuterated hydroxide, M(OD)ₙ, that decomposes upon heating.\n*   **Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n    1.  Substance X's \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards common reagents like LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄. Thus, X is likely LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n    2.  The \"product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to an alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This requires a powerful reducing agent.\n    3.  LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is strong enough to perform this reduction. NaBH₄ is not. This clue confirms the analog is LiAlH₄.\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on the strong reducing power and the formation of a precipitate with D₂O (Al(OD)₃ is a precipitate, unlike the products from NaBD₄), we can definitively identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)**.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X.\"\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Mass Calculation:** We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotope mass numbers.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (²H), each with a mass number of 2.

Identification of Key Substances from Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives `277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C`. This value is extremely close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and significantly different from that of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C. This allows us to confidently identify **Substance B as D₂O**. This identification also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the reaction is Deuterium (D, or ²H).\n\n*   **Gas W**: The gas W is described as having molecules where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Given that the system contains Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule contains two Deuterium atoms, for a total of **2 protons and 2 neutrons**, perfectly matching the clue. Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X and its Reaction**: Substance X is the core unknown. We know the following:\n    1.  It contains Deuterium.\n    2.  Its \"very close analog\" is a common organic chemistry reagent.\n    3.  It reacts with a keto acid to produce a compound with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygens (from a ketone group `>C=O` and a carboxylic acid group `-COOH`). Reducing the final oxygen count to 2 requires the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alcohol (`-COOH → -CH₂OH`). This specific reduction requires a very powerful agent. The common reagent Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is known for this, while milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not.\n    4.  This points to the analog being LiAlH₄. Therefore, Substance X, its deuterated version, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Proposed Reaction Scheme**\n\nWith the identities established (X=LiAlD₄, W=D₂, B=D₂O), we can verify the entire reaction. For the reaction to produce only deuterated products, the liquid Y must also be a deuterium source, making it D₂O.\n\n*   **Reaction**: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)↑`\n*   **Violent Reaction**: The reaction of LiAlH₄ (and LiAlD₄) with water is famously violent, matching the description.\n*   **Precipitate G**: The reaction produces Aluminium Deuteroxide, `Al(OD)₃`, which, like Aluminium Hydroxide, is an insoluble precipitate.\n*   **Release of B**: When heated, G (Al(OD)₃) decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. This correctly releases substance B (D₂O).\n\nAll clues are internally consistent with the identification of Substance X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Mass Summation**: The problem requires summing the masses of *all atoms* of these two elements, using their specific isotopic mass numbers (which are integers, as implied by the answer choices).\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (²H), with a mass number of **2**. There are **four** Deuterium atoms in the formula.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of **27**. There is **one** Aluminium atom in the formula.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    (Mass of all lightest element atoms) + (Mass of all heaviest element atoms)\n    = (4 × Mass of D) + (1 × Mass of Al)\n    = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27)\n    = 8 + 27\n    = **35**\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\nA) 29\nB) 35\nC) 25\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Converting to Celsius: 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that B is D₂O, and the \"heavier isotope\" central to the problem is Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   **Gas W**: The gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. Since the system involves Deuterium, the most logical candidate for the gas is D₂. Each Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fulfilling the condition.\n    *   **Substance X and the Organic Chemistry Reaction**: The problem states that X (or its analog) is a common organic reagent. Critically, its reaction with a \"keto acid\" results in a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), meaning it has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid must be reduced to an alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH), which removes one oxygen atom. Not all reducing agents can do this. A strong reducing agent like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is required. Milder agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) would fail to reduce the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Identifying X**: Since the analog is LiAlH₄, and Substance X must contain Deuterium, **X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Verify the Reaction Sequence with LiAlD₄**:\n    *   Let's assume the liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O) since that is the most plausible source of Deuterium for the other products.\n    *   **Reaction**: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It correctly produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It produces a precipitate, G. Aluminium hydroxide is a precipitate, so its deuterated analog, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), would also precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This reaction correctly releases Substance B (D₂O).\n    *   All the clues in the problem are consistent with the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n3.  **Perform the Final Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Atomic Number 3), Aluminium (Al, Atomic Number 13), and Hydrogen (H, Atomic Number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminium.\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements. The options are integers, so we will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n    *   **Mass of Lightest Element (Hydrogen)**: The molecule contains 4 atoms of Hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total Mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass of Heaviest Element (Aluminium)**: The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminium. Its stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total Mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   **Cumulative Mass** = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminium) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**:\n    The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly identify substance X as LiAlD₄ and perform the calculation to arrive at the value of 35. Comparing this calculated value to the provided options:\n    A) 25\n    B) 31\n    C) 35\n    D) 29\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis based on the reasoning provided by the candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Identification of Key Substances:**\n    *   There is a strong consensus among all answers that substance **B** is **D₂O (heavy water)**. This is based on its melting point being \"very close to 277 K\" (3.85 °C), which is the melting point of D₂O (3.82 °C).\n    *   There is also a strong consensus that gas **W** is **D₂ (deuterium gas)**. This is because its molecule needs to have an equal number of protons and neutrons (a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons), and its formation is consistent with a reaction involving D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identification of Substance X:**\n    *   All reasoning chains logically deduce that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   This conclusion is supported by multiple, consistent pieces of evidence:\n        *   It contains a heavy isotope (Deuterium).\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry.\n        *   It reacts violently with heavy water (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate. The precipitate is identified as Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which when heated would release D₂O, matching all clues.\n        *   It is a powerful enough reducing agent to reduce a keto acid (containing 3 oxygens) to a diol (containing 2 oxygens), as described in the problem.\n\n3.  **The Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest** element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest** element is Aluminium (Al).\n    *   All candidate answers correctly determine that the calculation should be:\n        (Total mass of Deuterium atoms) + (Total mass of Aluminium atoms)\n    *   Using integer mass numbers for the isotopes (as implied by the integer answers):\n        *   Mass of D = 2\n        *   Mass of Al = 27\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄, so there are 4 Deuterium atoms and 1 Aluminium atom.\n    *   Calculation: (4 × 2) + (1 × 27) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The reasoning from all candidate answers unanimously leads to the numerical result of **35**.\n    *   Reviewing the options:\n        *   A) 31\n        *   B) 29\n        *   C) 35\n        *   D) 25\n    *   The calculated value of 35 corresponds to option C. While many of the candidate answers contain a typo where they state the wrong letter for the correct numerical result, the logic itself is sound and consistently points to 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances**\n\nThe reasoning across nearly all candidate answers is consistent and logical in identifying the unknown substances:\n*   **Substance B:** Its melting point is ~277 K (3.85 °C). This is consistently identified as being very close to the melting point of **D₂O (heavy water)**, which is 3.82 °C.\n*   **Heavier Isotope:** The identification of B as D₂O leads to the conclusion that the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D)**.\n*   **Gas W:** The clue that the molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons strongly points to **D₂ gas**. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is the most chemically plausible answer in a system involving Deuterium.\n*   **Substance X:** Based on the chemical properties (powerful organic reducing agent, reacts violently with water/D₂O, forms a precipitate, reduces a keto acid to a product with 2 oxygens), the agents correctly deduce that **Substance X is LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)**. Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, fits the description of a widely used, powerful organic reagent. The reaction `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃↓ + LiOD + 4D₂↑` accounts for all observations, including the precipitate **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n\n**2. The Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄)\".\n*   **Elements in X:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (Atomic Number Z=13).\n*   The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements. Integer mass numbers are used, as implied by the integer options.\n    *   The mass of the isotope Deuterium (²H) is 2.\n    *   The mass of the stable isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) is 27.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (4 atoms of Deuterium): 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (1 atom of Aluminium): 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = **35**\n\n**3. Analysis of Candidate Answers and Final Decision**\n\nA clear majority of the candidate answers (Answers 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and others) correctly deduce that Substance X is LiAlD₄ and perform the calculation to arrive at the value **35**.\n\nWhile some agents select an incorrect letter (e.g., Answer 2 chooses B, Answer 4 chooses A), their own reasoning leads to the number 35. This suggests a simple mapping error. The consensus of the sound reasoning points unequivocally to the numerical answer of 35.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 29\nB) 31\nC) 25\nD) 35\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The key starting point is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Conversion to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (or 276.97 K).\n    *   This is an almost perfect match, so we can confidently identify **B as D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Isotope and Gas W:** The presence of D₂O indicates the \"heavier isotope\" in the problem is Deuterium (D, or ²H). The problem states that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the deuterium context, the most logical candidate is D₂ gas.\n    *   Each Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description, so we identify **W as D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** The properties of substance X lead to its identification.\n    *   **Reaction:** It reacts violently with a liquid (Y) to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G). To get pure D₂, the liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium, meaning **Y is D₂O**. The reaction is therefore `X + D₂O → G↓ + D₂↑`.\n    *   **Precipitate:** The precipitate G, when heated, releases D₂O. This suggests G is a metal deuteroxide, like Al(OD)₃, which decomposes on heating: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Clues:** X's \"very close analog\" is a common organic reagent, and X reduces a keto acid to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one from the ketone, two from the carboxylic acid). Reducing a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`) removes one oxygen atom. This requires a strong reducing agent. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous strong reducing agent; its analog Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) is not strong enough.\n    *   Therefore, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄, and Substance X, which contains deuterium, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verification:** The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)` fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (Al).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using integer mass numbers for the isotopes. Mass of D = 2. Mass of Al = 27.\n    *   Total mass from lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Total mass from heaviest element (Aluminium): There is 1 atom of Aluminium. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis calculated value of 35 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is based on a consensus of the reasoning provided by the different agents, focusing on the derivation of the solution rather than just the final letter choice, as there were discrepancies in mapping the calculated value to the options.\n\n**1. Identification of the Substances**\n*   **Substance B:** The melting point of B is ~277 K (3.85 °C). This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. All agents correctly identified B as D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved is Deuterium (D).\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that the system contains deuterium, the only logical candidate is D₂ gas. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This was a unanimous conclusion.\n*   **Substance X:** Based on the chemical properties (organic reagent, reduces a keto acid to a product with 2 oxygen atoms, reacts violently with a liquid Y to form a precipitate and D₂ gas), the agents correctly identified that X must be a strong deuterated reducing agent. The ability to reduce a carboxylic acid (part of the keto acid) points specifically to Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) as the analog. Therefore, Substance X, its deuterated version, is **LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n*   **Liquid Y and Precipitate G:** The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑` consistently explains all the clues. Liquid Y is D₂O, and the precipitate G is Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\n\n**2. Calculation**\nThe task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), Hydrogen (as isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest element (by atomic number):** Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Calculation:** The question requires summing the mass of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using their isotopic mass numbers.\n    *   There are **four** atoms of the lightest element (Deuterium, D). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   There is **one** atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium, Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nThe reasoning provided by all agents overwhelmingly and correctly leads to the calculated value of 35. This value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the final answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B.**\nThe problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D or ²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The given value is an excellent match for heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W.**\nThe problem states that gas W's molecule has \"the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   Since the presence of deuterium (D) is confirmed from Step 1, it's logical to consider gases made of hydrogen isotopes.\n*   A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) has 2 protons (1 from each atom) and 2 neutrons (1 from each atom). The number of protons and neutrons is equal.\n*   This fits the description perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X.**\n*   **Reaction Context:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope (now confirmed as D), reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O. This strongly implies that X is a reactive metal deuteride, Y is D₂O, and G is a metal deuteroxide.\n*   **Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n    1.  \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common reagent.\n    2.  \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group >C=O, and two in the carboxylic acid group -COOH). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid must be reduced to alcohol groups. A reagent powerful enough to do this is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n*   **Putting it together:** The \"close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Therefore, Substance X, which contains deuterium, must be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify LiAlD₄ against all clues.**\n*   **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n*   This reaction is famously violent.\n*   It produces D₂ gas (W), which matches our identification.\n*   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate (G).\n*   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`, which correctly yields B as D₂O.\n*   All clues are consistent with **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation.**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminium.\n*   We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **four** D atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **one** Al atom.\n*   **Cumulative Mass Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\nThe calculated value is 35. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 35\nB) 31\nC) 25\nD) 29\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances from Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The clue states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   277 K is equal to 3.85 °C (277 - 273.15).\n    *   This is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (deuterium oxide), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Normal water, H₂O, melts at 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   This is overwhelming evidence that **Substance B is D₂O**.\n    *   Consequently, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue is Deuterium (D or ²H), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The gas W is described as having molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Given the context of Deuterium, let's test Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   Each Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n    *   This confirms that **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G. Since all the products contain Deuterium (D₂ gas and a precipitate that yields D₂O), the liquid reactant Y must also be a source of deuterium. The most logical candidate for a liquid reagent in this context is **heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identification of Substance X**\n\n*   We need to find a deuterated compound (Substance X) that:\n    1.  Has an analog commonly used in organic chemistry.\n    2.  Reacts violently with D₂O to form D₂ gas and a precipitate (G).\n    3.  When reacted with a keto acid, yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n*   The clue about organic chemistry points towards common reducing agents. The most powerful common reducing agents are Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs are **LiAlD₄** and **NaBD₄**.\n\n*   Let's test these candidates:\n    *   **The keto acid reaction:** A keto acid has a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), totaling 3 oxygen atoms. The final product has only 2 oxygen atoms. This means the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to an alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). LiAlH₄ is strong enough for this reduction, but NaBH₄ is not. This points towards the analog being LiAlH₄, and thus **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **The precipitate reaction:** Let's verify the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O.\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n        In this reaction, Aluminum Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is insoluble and forms a precipitate (G). When G is heated, it decomposes to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B), matching all the clues. (A similar reaction with NaBD₄ would produce soluble products, so no precipitate would form).\n\n*   All evidence points conclusively to **Substance X = LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n\n**3. The Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   The substance is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   Based on atomic number or atomic mass, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** and the **heaviest element is Aluminium**.\n*   The question states to sum the masses of all instances of these elements in the molecule, using the mass numbers of the relevant isotopes.\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **4** atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **1** atom of Aluminium.\n*   Calculation:\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = **35**\n\n*   Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 35\n    B) 25\n    C) 29\n    D) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe process to solve this problem can be broken down into two main parts: first, identifying the unknown substance X based on a series of chemical clues, and second, performing the calculation as described.\n\n### Part 1: Identifying Substance X\n\n1.  **Melting Point of B:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\" (3.85 °C). This is a strong indicator of heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This implies the system involves deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n2.  **Gas W:** The gas W has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the presence of deuterium, the gas is almost certainly deuterium gas (D₂). A D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the clue perfectly.\n3.  **The Reaction:** A substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O (Substance B).\n    *   For the reaction to produce only D₂ gas and deuterated products, the liquid reactant Y must also be a source of deuterium. Thus, **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   G is a precipitate that releases D₂O upon heating, which is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)n) decomposing into a metal oxide and D₂O.\n4.  **Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n    *   The \"close analog\" of X is a common organic reagent. This suggests well-known reagents like LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄. The substance X would therefore be their deuterated counterparts, LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n    *   X reacts with a keto acid (which has ≥3 oxygen atoms) to produce a compound with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both the ketone (C=O) group and the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) is strong enough for this, whereas NaBH₄ is not. The reaction reduces the keto acid to a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups), which has exactly 2 oxygen atoms.\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity:** Based on all the clues, substance X must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   The reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G, precipitate) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W, gas)`.\n    *   Heating G (`Al(OD)₃`) produces D₂O (B). All conditions are met.\n\n### Part 2: Performing the Calculation\n\n1.  **The Goal:** Calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula for X is **LiAlD₄**.\n2.  **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest** element by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest** element by atomic number is Aluminium.\n3.  **Sum the Masses:** The problem specifies summing the masses of all instances of these elements, using the mass numbers of the relevant isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is one atom of Aluminium (²⁷Al). Its mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n4.  **Final Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the two totals = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) 31\nB) 35\nC) 29\nD) 25\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution based on the reasoning provided by the candidate agents:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The crucial starting point, identified correctly by nearly all agents, is the melting point of substance B, given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is very near the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), and distinct from normal water (H₂O) which melts at 0 °C.\n    *   Thus, **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W and the Core Chemistry:**\n    *   The identification of B as D₂O implies that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the reaction is Deuterium (D, or ²H).\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the deuterium context, the gas D₂ is the most logical candidate (1 proton + 1 neutron per atom, so the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce a precipitate (G) and D₂ gas (W). To get pure D₂ gas, the liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium, making **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   The clues state that X's analog is a common organic reagent and that X reduces a keto acid (which has ≥3 oxygen atoms) to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This points to a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is the prime candidate for the analog.\n    *   Therefore, Substance X must be its deuterated version: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   This is confirmed by the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G, precipitate) + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W, gas)`. All byproducts and reaction characteristics align with the problem statement. Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) yields D₂O (B).\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium (Al).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved: D = 2, Al = 27.\n    *   Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 25\n    B) 29\n    C) 35\n    D) 31\n    The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1. Deconstruction of Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\" (3.85 °C). This is an exact match for the melting point of heavy water, **D₂O** (3.82 °C or 276.97 K), and rules out normal water (H₂O, 0 °C). This is the key insight. The \"heavier isotope\" is therefore **Deuterium (D)**.\n*   **Gas W:** Gas W has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that the reaction involves deuterium, the most likely candidate is **D₂** (di-deuterium gas). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms (each with 1 proton and 1 neutron), for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   **Substances G and Y:** A precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide decomposing into a metal oxide and heavy water. The fact that the entire system is deuterated (producing D₂ and D₂O) means the reacting liquid Y is almost certainly **D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identification of Substance X using Organic Chemistry Clues**\n\n*   **Reagent Type:** Substance X and its \"very close analog\" are used in organic chemistry. This points to common laboratory reagents.\n*   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH) has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group, containing at least 3 oxygen atoms. For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, both functional groups must have been reduced to alcohols (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH), a diol).\n*   **Identifying the Reagent:** Only very strong reducing agents can reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids. Lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH₄) is famous for this, while milder reagents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) are not. The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, meaning Substance X, containing deuterium, must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**3. Verification of all Steps**\n\n*   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all clues.\n*   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   The reaction is violent.\n    *   Gas W is D₂, which has equal protons and neutrons.\n    *   A precipitate G, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), is formed.\n    *   Heating G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) releases B (D₂O), which has a melting point of ~277 K.\n*   All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminium.\n*   We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotopic masses (mass numbers).\n    *   **Mass of all lightest element atoms:** There are four atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). Mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n    *   **Mass of all heaviest element atoms:** There is one atom of Aluminium (²⁷Al). Mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = **27**.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nBased on the options provided in the prompt's context, the value 35 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O, where D is the isotope deuterium, ²H) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   The match is nearly perfect, so we can confidently identify **Substance B as D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The clue states that gas W has molecules with an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Since we have identified D₂O, the system clearly involves the hydrogen isotope deuterium (D). Let's test D₂ gas.\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description, so we can identify **Gas W as D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Other Substances (X, Y, G):**\n    *   We know substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G.\n    *   Since the products involve deuterium (D₂), and B (released from G) is also D₂O, the system must be rich in deuterium. This implies that **liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   The reaction `X + D₂O → G (precipitate) + D₂ (gas)` involves a deuterated compound (X) reacting with heavy water.\n    *   Precipitate G releases D₂O (B) upon heating. This is a characteristic decomposition of a metal deuteroxide (`M(OD)n → Metal Oxide + D₂O`). So, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n4.  **Use Organic Chemistry Clues to Identify X:**\n    *   The clues state that X's \"very close analog\" is a common organic reagent and that X reduces a \"certain keto acid\" to a product containing only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   A keto acid (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH) has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to an alcohol group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   A common reagent capable of this powerful reduction is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   Therefore, the \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Substance X, containing the heavier isotope (D), must be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Complete Reaction:**\n    *   The proposed reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   This reaction is famously violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G), since aluminum hydroxide is insoluble.\n    *   Heating G (`Al(OD)₃`) produces `Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O` (B).\n    *   All clues align perfectly. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The question states to sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the formula.

This is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water, **D₂O** (3.82 °C), confirming that the heavy isotope involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Gas W:** The clue that its molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons strongly points to **D₂ gas** (2 protons, 2 neutrons), especially given the established presence of deuterium.\n    *   **Substance X:** The combined clues indicate that X is a deuterated compound, its analog is a powerful organic reducing agent (like LiAlH₄), it reacts violently with a protic solvent, and the reaction forms a precipitate.\n        *   The reaction with a keto acid (3 oxygens) yielding a product with 2 oxygens requires the reduction of both a ketone and a carboxylic acid, which points specifically to an analog of LiAlH₄, a very strong reducing agent.\n        *   Therefore, Substance X must be **LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n    *   **Substance Y and G:** For the reaction `LiAlD₄ + Y → D₂ + G (precipitate)` to work, Y must be **D₂O**. This leads to the reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → Al(OD)₃↓ + LiOD + 4 D₂↑`. This confirms that the precipitate G is **Al(OD)₃**. All clues are consistent with this identification.\n\n2.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements found in the formula LiAlD₄.

Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 35\n    B) 29\n    C) 31\n    D) 25\n\n    The correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the heavy isotope.**\nThe melting point of substance B is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value is an almost perfect match for heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n*   This implies that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**, which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W.**\nGas W is described as having molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   Since the reaction involves deuterium, the most likely gas produced is some form of hydrogen gas.\n*   Let's analyze D₂ (di-deuterium gas). A single deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A molecule of D₂ therefore has (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons.\n*   This perfectly fits the description. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X.**\nMultiple clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n*   **Reagent type:** Its \"very close analog\" is a common organic chemistry reagent. This points towards compounds like LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄. Since X contains a heavy isotope, the candidates are LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄.\n*   **Reaction products:** The reaction of X with liquid Y produces D₂ gas and a precipitate (G). Let's assume the liquid Y is D₂O to supply the deuterium needed for the products.\n    *   If X were LiAlD₄: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂`. This reaction produces a precipitate, which matches the clue. The precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), when heated, would decompose to release D₂O (Substance B), which is also consistent.\n    *   If X were NaBD₄: The reaction products with D₂O are soluble, so no precipitate would form. This rules out NaBD₄.\n*   **Reaction with keto acid:** X reacts with a keto acid (which has at least 3 oxygen atoms) to give a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This means both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups are reduced to alcohols. LiAlH₄ (the analog of X) is a strong enough reagent to do this, while NaBH₄ is not.\n\nAll clues converge to identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)**.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the final calculation.**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen, present as its isotope Deuterium (D).\n*   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminium (Al).\n*   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecular formula, using their integer mass numbers as implied by the answer choices.\n    *   Mass number of Deuterium (D, or ²H) = 2.\n    *   Mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n*   The formula LiAlD₄ contains one Aluminium atom and four Deuterium atoms.\n*   Mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   Mass from Hydrogen (Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   Cumulative sum = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the provided answers.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Substances based on Properties:**\n    *   **Substance B:** The melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\". This is 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), while normal water melts at 0 °C (273.15 K). This is a strong, almost certain indication that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Heavy Isotope:** The identification of D₂O means the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned is Deuterium (D, or ²H).\n    *   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Given the context of Deuterium, let's analyze Deuterium gas (D₂). A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect fit. **W is D₂**.\n    *   **Substance G & Liquid Y:** G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a typical decomposition of a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₙ). For this to be produced in a reaction with liquid Y, it is most logical that **Y is D₂O**. The reaction is thus: X + D₂O → G(precipitate) + W(D₂ gas).\n    *   **Substance X:** We know X contains Deuterium. The clues are:\n        1.  Its analog is a common organic chemistry reagent.\n        2.  It reduces a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a powerful reducing agent that can reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids, like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). The milder Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) would fail.\n        3.  The deuterated analog of LiAlH₄ is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        4.  Let's verify the precipitation: The reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O is `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃(s) + LiOD(aq) + 4D₂(g)`. Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is indeed a precipitate (G). This matches all clues.\n\n2.  **Confirm the Identity:**\n    The logical chain is consistent and robust. Every clue points to the same set of substances:\n    *   X = LiAlD₄\n    *   Y = D₂O\n    *   W = D₂\n    *   G = Al(OD)₃\n    *   B = D₂O\n\n3.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    The task is to calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminium.\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes.\n    *   **Mass of Aluminium:** There is one Al atom. The mass number of the stable isotope is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Mass of Hydrogen:** There are four H atoms, all as the isotope Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** Total Mass = (Mass of Al) + (Mass of all D atoms) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n4.  **Select the Correct Option:**\n    The calculated value is 35. Comparing this with the provided options:\n    A) 29\n    B) 25\n    C) 35\n    D) 31\n\n    The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a remarkable consensus on the reasoning and calculation, despite some confusion in the final letter choices. Here is the synthesized, step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K.\"\n*   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This strongly indicates that **B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe gas W, produced in the reaction, has molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   Given the context of Deuterium, we analyze D₂ gas. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**.\n*   This matches the clue perfectly, making **W = D₂ gas**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\nA series of clues allows for the systematic identification of X:\n*   **The Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y to form gas D₂ and a precipitate G. For the reaction to yield pure D₂ gas, both X (a deuteride) and Y (a liquid) must be deuterium sources. Thus, **liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction of X with D₂O also forms the precipitate G.\n*   **The Precipitate G:** G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This confirms G is a deuterated hydroxide, M(OD)ₙ, that decomposes upon heating.\n*   **Organic Chemistry Clues:**\n    1.  Substance X's \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards common reagents like LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄. Thus, X is likely LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n    2.  The \"product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to an alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This requires a powerful reducing agent.\n    3.  LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is strong enough to perform this reduction. NaBH₄ is not. This clue confirms the analog is LiAlH₄.\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on the strong reducing power and the formation of a precipitate with D₂O (Al(OD)₃ is a precipitate, unlike the products from NaBD₄), we can definitively identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)**.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X.\"\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Mass Calculation:** We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotope mass numbers.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (²H), each with a mass number of 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is **one** atom of Aluminium (²⁷Al), with a mass number of 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = **27**.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Option**\nThe calculated value is 35. This corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\nA) 29\nB) 35\nC) 31\nD) 25\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
