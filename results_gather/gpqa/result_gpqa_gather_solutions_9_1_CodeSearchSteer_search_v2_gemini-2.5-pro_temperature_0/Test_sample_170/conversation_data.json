Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring with different substituents. We need to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-monobromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same for a given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring can be classified based on their directing effect in electrophilic substitution:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They generally have a high yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will have a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's classify the given substituents:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:**\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Meta-directors:**\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n**3. Initial Ordering**\n\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-product, and ortho, para-directors produce a significant amount, we can immediately say that the substances with meta-directing groups will come first in the list (lowest para yield), followed by the substances with ortho, para-directing groups.\n\nOrder: {4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is very small. The order depends on the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group makes the ring less reactive and more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the ortho and para isomers.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will produce the lowest amount of para-product.\n*   **-COOH (6) and -COOC2H5 (2):** Both are strongly deactivating, but less so than -NO2. The -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOC2H5 group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C2H5) in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power of the carbonyl group.\n\nTherefore, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\nThis means the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order: -NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5.\nSo, the order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-product to the ortho-product. A higher para/ortho ratio means a higher overall percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** This is a relatively small group. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products, with the para-isomer being favored (typically ~67% para).\n*   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance makes attack at the ortho positions more difficult, thus increasing the proportion of the para-product compared to toluene. So, the para yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene.\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director, but it's deactivating. Its strong inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance, strongly favors the para position. The para yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is very high (typically ~87%). This yield is generally higher than that for ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\nSo, the order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nFinal Order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their electronic effects and directing properties:\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the benzene ring, increasing its reactivity towards electrophiles and directing substitution to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but still direct incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it much less reactive and directing substitution to the meta position. Consequently, they produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### **Ordering the Substances**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer, while those with ortho/para-directing groups will have the highest.\n\n#### **1. Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor nitrobenzene (4), benzoic acid (6), and ethyl benzoate (2), the major product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is minimal. The order among these is determined by the strength of the deactivating effect.\n\n*   **Nitrobenzene (-NO2, 4):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para product (around 0-5%).\n*   **Benzoic acid (-COOH, 6):** The carboxylic acid group is also strongly deactivating. The para-isomer yield is very low, typically around 1-2%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5, 2):** The ester group is a strong deactivator, similar to a carboxylic acid. Data for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows about 5% para-product, which is slightly higher than for the other meta-directors.\n\nBased on the deactivating strength and typical isomer distributions, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n#### **2. Ortho/Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the major products are the ortho and para isomers. The ratio between them is determined primarily by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n\n*   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. Conventional bromination of toluene yields about 30-40% ortho-isomer and 60-70% para-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For example, in mercuration, the para-product percentage increases from 79.2% for toluene to 83.2% for ethylbenzene. A similar trend is expected for bromination.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is an ortho/para-director. While deactivating, it gives a very high yield of the para-isomer upon bromination, around 89%.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we need to arrange the given benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. The weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Directing Effects:** First, we'll classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n    *   *Ortho, para-directors* yield a high percentage of the para-isomer.\n    *   *Meta-directors* yield a very low percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n2.  **Group the Substances:**\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), -Cl (3).\n    *   **Meta-directors:** -NO2 (4), -COOC2H5 (2), -COOH (6).\n    This means the final sequence will have substances 4, 2, and 6 at the beginning (in some order) and 1, 5, and 3 at the end (in some order).\n\n3.  **Order the Meta-Directors:** For meta-directors, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield decreases as the deactivating (and meta-directing) strength of the group increases.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors:** For these, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the para/ortho ratio, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** Gives a high para yield (~67%), but generally the lowest among these three due to its relatively small size allowing for more ortho attack.\n    *   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than methyl, causing more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increases the para-isomer yield compared to toluene.\n    *   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** While halogens are deactivating, they are strongly para-directing. Literature data often shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~89%) is very high, even slightly higher than for bulky alkyl groups like tert-butylbenzene (~88%). This suggests the order of increasing para yield is Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    *   Thus, the order is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n5.  **Combine the Orders:** By combining the two groups, we get the final sequence.\n    *   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n    *   The complete order is: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** This sequence matches option C. The following Python code will verify this logic by sorting the substances based on their approximate para-isomer yields.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by ordering substances based on the para-isomer yield\n    in electrophilic bromination.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define substances with their number, name, and directing group type.\n    # We also assign an approximate para-isomer percentage yield based on chemical principles and literature data.\n    # C6H5- means a benzene ring.\n    # 1) С6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n    # 2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    # 3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    # 4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    # 5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n    # 6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n    substances = {\n        1: {'name': 'Toluene', 'group': '-CH3', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 67},\n        2: {'name': 'Ethyl benzoate', 'group': '-COOC2H5', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 4},\n        3: {'name': 'Chlorobenzene', 'group': '-Cl', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 89},\n        4: {'name': 'Nitrobenzene', 'group': '-NO2', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 1},\n        5: {'name': 'Ethylbenzene', 'group': '-C2H5', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 85}, # Less than Cl, more than CH3\n        6: {'name': 'Benzoic acid', 'group': '-COOH', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 2}\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Sort the substances based on their para-isomer yield in increasing order.\n    # The sorted() function takes a list of items and a key.

The substituent already on the benzene ring (C6H5-) directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) to specific positions. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the nature of this substituent.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents**\nWe need to classify the substituents into two main categories:\n1.  **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The products are a mixture of ortho and para isomers.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl group)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl group)\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro group)\n2.  **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is formed in very small amounts.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro group)\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxyl group)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ester group)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the para-isomer yield for meta-directors**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring towards ortho/para attack.\n*   The deactivating strength of these groups follows the order: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, so it will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The -COOC2H5 group is the weakest deactivator among the three, so it will give the highest yield of the para-isomer among this group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the para-isomer yield for ortho, para-directors**\nSubstances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 3, 5) will have much higher yields of the para-isomer. The distribution between the ortho and para positions depends on steric and electronic factors. A higher para/ortho ratio leads to a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The para position is sterically unhindered, while the ortho positions are adjacent to the substituent. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer. The order of steric bulk is: -C2H5 > -CH3 > -Cl.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** For halogens like -Cl, a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates the ortho position more than the para position, which also favors para substitution.\n*   **Comparing the groups:**\n    *   **-CH3 (1):** The methyl group has moderate steric bulk. The para-isomer is favored over the ortho, but the ortho product is still significant. (Para yield is ~67%).\n    *   **-Cl (3):** The combination of steric hindrance and the strong deactivating inductive effect at the ortho position makes the para-isomer highly favored. (Para yield is ~87%).\n    *   **-C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group is significantly bulkier than the methyl group. This large steric hindrance makes the para-isomer extremely favored. (Para yield is ~94%).\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is: 1 < 3 < 5.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results to get the final order**\nWe combine the two groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 3 < 5\n*   Combining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the given options**\nLet's check the provided options against our derived correct order (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5).\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect.\n*   B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - This option correctly orders the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) and correctly identifies toluene (1) as the least para-selective of the o,p-directors. However, it incorrectly swaps the order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). The correct order is 3 < 5, not 5 < 3.\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect.\n*   D) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect.\n\nAmong the given choices, option B is the closest to the chemically correct order. It correctly orders the first four substances in the sequence (4 < 6 < 2 < 1). The only error is the relative order of the last two substances. In the context of a multiple-choice question with a likely error, this is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attack and the rate of the reaction.\n\n*   **Activating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating\n*   **Deactivating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but have lone pairs that can donate through resonance, directing the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate)\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro)\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Separate into low-yield and high-yield groups**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can separate the substances into two groups:\n*   **Low para-yield group (meta-directors):** For these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The main product is the meta-isomer. This group includes substances 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **High para-yield group (ortho/para-directors):** For these substances, the para-isomer is a major product, along with the ortho-isomer. This group includes substances 1, 3, and 5.\n\nThe final ordered list will have all the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho/para-directors.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within the low-yield (meta-directing) group**\n\nThe substances are 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), and 2 (-COOC2H5). For these meta-directors, the amount of para-product formed is inversely proportional to the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will lead to a higher percentage of the meta-isomer and consequently a lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is one of the strongest deactivators, followed by carboxylic acid, and then the ester).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within the high-yield (ortho/para-directing) group**\n\nThe substances are 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), and 3 (-Cl). The yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing 1 (-CH3) and 5 (-C2H5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is their size. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This larger size creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position relatively more accessible for the incoming bromine. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** The chloro group is deactivating but directs ortho/para. For halogens, electronic factors cause a strong preference for substitution at the para position compared to the ortho position. The deactivating inductive effect is felt more strongly at the ortho position than the para position. This leads to a very high para/ortho ratio. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% of the para-isomer, which is higher than the yield from toluene (about 67%). It is also expected to be higher than the yield from ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest para-isomer yield in this group.\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups to get the final order**\n\nWe combine the ordered low-yield group and the ordered high-yield group. The para-yield for any ortho/para-director will be significantly greater than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Low-yield order: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   High-yield order: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5 < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived order matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two groups: ortho-, para-directing and meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves.\n    *   1) **-CH3** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low.\n    *   4) **-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Ordering the Substances**\n\n**1. Meta-directing groups (Lowest para-yield):**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4):** The -NO2 group is a very strong deactivating, meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene requires harsh conditions and yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer (m-bromonitrobenzene). The para-isomer yield is negligible, often less than 1%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2) and Benzoic acid (6):** The -COOC2H5 and -COOH groups are also deactivating and meta-directing. While still producing very low amounts of the para-isomer, they are generally less deactivating than the nitro group. For bromination of benzoic acid, the distribution is approximately 75-80% meta, 20-25% ortho, and only a very small fraction (1-2%) para. The ester group (-COOC2H5) behaves similarly to the carboxylic acid group.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield among the meta-directors is: **4 (-NO2) < 2 (-COOC2H5) ≈ 6 (-COOH)**. The options provided distinguish between 2 and 6, and typically the ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid, but both result in very low para yields. Based on typical data, the order is generally considered **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-directing groups (Highest para-yield):**\n\nFor these groups, the formation of the para-isomer is favored, and the yield is influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3):** The -Cl group is ortho-, para-directing. For bromination, the para-isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk and electronic effect of the chlorine atom. The typical distribution for bromination gives a high yield of the para-isomer, often around 87-90%.\n*   **Toluene (1):** The -CH3 group is less sterically hindering than -Cl or -C2H5. During bromination, it yields a significant amount of both ortho and para products. The para-isomer yield is typically around 33-40%.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5):** The -C2H5 group is bulkier than the -CH3 group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a greater preference for para-substitution compared to toluene. The para-isomer yield for bromination of ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene, typically around 40-50%.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield among the ortho-, para-directors is: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**.\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Lowest yield (<1%).\n2.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Very low yield (~1-2%).\n3.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low yield (~1-2%, slightly different from the ester).\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Moderate para yield (~33-40%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to sterics (~40-50%).\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Highest para yield (~87-90%).\n\nThe complete sequence is **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Incorrect - reverse order)\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect)\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect)\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (This order is very close to our derived order, with a slight swap of 2 and 6, which have very similar and low para yields).\n\nLet's re-examine the order of 2 and 6. Both -COOH and -COOC2H5 are strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Their para yields are minimal and very close. The provided options suggest a specific order. Let's assume the order in option D is the intended one.\n\nFinal Order based on analysis and matching with options: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Analysis of Substituent Effects on Electrophilic Bromination\n\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must first classify the substituents on the benzene ring. These substituents determine the reaction's regioselectivity, directing the incoming bromine to specific positions (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**1. Classification of Substituents:**\n\nThe substituents are classified based on their electronic effects (activating or deactivating) and their directing influence (ortho/para or meta).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the benzene ring, making it more reactive. They direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH₃ (Toluene, 1):** Alkyl group, activating.\n    *   **-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Alkyl group, activating.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** Halogens are electron-withdrawing via induction (deactivating) but can donate electrons via resonance, which directs substitution to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Halogen, deactivating.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw significant electron density from the ring, making it less reactive and directing the electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating.\n    *   **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating.\n\n**2. Isomer Distribution and Para-Yield:**\n\nThe percentage of the para-isomer formed depends on the nature of the substituent.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 2, 6):** For nitrobenzene (4), ethyl benzoate (2), and benzoic acid (6), the primary product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low. For instance, the nitration of ethyl benzoate yields only 5% of the para-isomer, with the majority being the meta-product (73%). Similarly, the bromination of nitrobenzene almost exclusively produces the meta-isomer. Therefore, these three substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields. Among these, the deactivating strength generally follows the order -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅, which correlates with lower ortho/para substitution. Thus, the para yield order is expected to be 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n*   **Ortho/Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3):** For toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the substitution occurs at the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products is influenced by steric hindrance.\n    *   **-CH₃ and -C₂H₅:** Alkyl groups are ortho/para directors. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions in ethylbenzene favors substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) is expected to have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). For example, in nitration, toluene gives 37% para-product, while the more sterically hindered tert-butylbenzene gives 75% para-product.\n    *   **-Cl:** The chloro group is also an ortho/para director. Halogens typically yield a high percentage of the para-isomer due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene results in 70% para-product. In bromination, chlorobenzene shows high selectivity for the para position, with yields over 95% under certain conditions. This strong preference for the para position is generally higher than for simple alkylbenzenes.\n\n**3. Final Ordering:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can establish the order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Lowest Yields (Meta-Directors):** The deactivating, meta-directing groups will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer. The order among them, from lowest to highest para yield, is generally accepted as: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n2.  **Intermediate Yields (Ortho/Para-Directors):** The activating alkyl groups will produce significant amounts of para-isomer. Due to less steric hindrance, toluene (1) will have a lower para-to-ortho ratio compared to the bulkier ethylbenzene (5). Thus, the order is Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n3.  **Highest Yield (Ortho/Para-Director):** The chloro group in chlorobenzene (3) strongly directs substitution to the para position, often with very high selectivity, surpassing that of the alkylbenzenes.\n\nCombining these groups, the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing.\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the positions ortho and para to themselves. Generally, these will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH3** (Methyl): Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   5) **-C2H5** (Ethyl): Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chloro): Deactivating, but ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. They produce very little para-isomer, so their para-isomer yield will be the lowest.\n    *   4) **-NO2** (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5** (Ethyl ester): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### Step 2: Rank the Meta-Directors\n\nThe meta-directing substituents will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer. For these compounds, the vast majority of the product will be the meta-isomer.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4, C6H5-NO2):** The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating, meta-directing groups. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-product, with para-isomer yields being negligible, often less than 1%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2, C6H5-COOC2H5):** The ester group is also deactivating and meta-directing. Data for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows it yields predominantly the meta-product (73%), with a small amount of para-isomer (5%).\n*   **Benzoic acid (6, C6H5-COOH):** The carboxylic acid group is deactivating and meta-directing, similar to the ester group.\n\nComparing these three, the -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, leading to the lowest overall yield and the lowest proportion of the para-isomer. Between -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating effects are comparable, but both will produce significantly more para-isomer than the -NO2 group. Generally, the order of para-isomer yield will be: **-NO2 < -COOC2H5 ≈ -COOH**. Therefore, the beginning of our sequence is **4 < 2 ≈ 6**.\n\n### Step 3: Rank the Ortho-, Para-Directors\n\nFor the ortho-, para-directing substituents (-Cl, -CH3, -C2H5), the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ortho-to-para ratio. This ratio is primarily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\nLet's compare the steric bulk of these groups:\n*   **-CH3 (Methyl):** This is a relatively small alkyl group.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethyl):** This group is larger than the methyl group.\n*   **-Cl (Chloro):** This is a single atom.\n\nThe steric hindrance increases in the order: **-Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5**.\n*   **Toluene (1, C6H5-CH3):** The bromination of toluene yields about 66.8% para-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5, C6H5-C2H5):** Due to the larger size of the ethyl group compared to the methyl group, there is more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This favors the formation of the para-isomer even more than in toluene. Nitration data, for example, shows that the para-isomer percentage increases from 37% for toluene to 49% for ethylbenzene. A similar trend is expected for bromination.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3, C6H5-Cl):** While the chloro group is ortho-, para-directing, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect deactivates the ring. However, the key factor for the *ratio* is sterics. The chlorine atom is sterically less demanding than a methyl group. However, experimental data for halogenation of chlorobenzene often shows a high percentage of the para-isomer, sometimes as high as 70% for nitration. For bromination, the para-isomer is also heavily favored.\n\nLet's refine the order based on typical isomer distributions:\n*   The para-isomer yield increases as the steric bulk of the alkyl group increases: **-CH3 < -C2H5**.\n*   Comparing the alkyl groups to the chloro group, halogenation of chlorobenzene typically results in a very high para-isomer yield, often higher than for toluene and ethylbenzene under similar conditions. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene gives about 64-70% para-isomer, while for toluene it's about 37% and ethylbenzene about 49%. This suggests the order of para-yield is **-CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Rankings\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **4 (C6H5-NO2):** Lowest yield (meta-director, strong deactivator).\n2.  **2 (C6H5-COOC2H5):** Very low yield (meta-director).\n3.  **6 (C6H5-COOH):** Very low yield (meta-director, similar to 2).\n4.  **1 (C6H5-CH3):** Significant para yield, but less than 5 and 3 due to lower steric hindrance.\n5.  **5 (C6H5-C2H5):** Higher para yield than 1 due to increased steric hindrance.\n6.  **3 (C6H5-Cl):** Highest para yield among the o,p-directors.\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nLooking at the options, this does not perfectly match any of them. Let's re-evaluate the order of 2 and 6. The -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups have similar deactivating strengths. Without precise experimental data for bromination of both under identical conditions, their relative order is ambiguous but they will be close and occupy the positions after -NO2.\n\nLet's re-examine the options provided:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOption B starts with the meta-directors (4, 2, 6) and ends with the ortho, para-directors (3, 1, 5). Let's analyze the order within these groups in option B.\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 2 < 6**. This is plausible, with NO2 giving the least para-product.\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: **3 < 1 < 5**. This implies the para yield is Cl < CH3 < C2H5. This contradicts our analysis based on steric hindrance and literature data, which suggests the para-yield increases with steric bulk (CH3 < C2H5) and that halogens often give a high para ratio.\n\nLet's reconsider the steric hindrance argument. The primary factor for the ortho/para ratio is the size of the substituent.\n*   Size: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl.\n*   This would lead to a para-isomer yield order of: Cl < CH3 < C2H5.\nThis matches the order in option B: **3 < 1 < 5**.\n\nLet's combine this with the meta-directors. The deactivating strength is generally considered -NO2 > -COOR > -COOH. This would mean the para-yield is **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\nCombining these two orderings gives: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**. This matches option B exactly.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n*   **Lowest para yield:** Meta-directors. Order based on deactivating strength: NO2 > COOC2H5 > COOH. So, para yield is 4 < 2 < 6.\n*   **Highest para yield:** Ortho, para-directors. Order based on increasing steric hindrance favoring the para position: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl. So, para yield is 3 < 1 < 5.\n*   **Combined:** 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5.\n\nThis provides a consistent rationale for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring (C6H5-X). The substituent (X) on the ring determines two things:\n1.  **Reactivity:** Whether the ring reacts faster (activating group) or slower (deactivating group) than benzene itself.\n2.  **Orientation:** Where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add. Substituents are either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\nThe question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance:\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is **deactivating** but **ortho, para-directing** (a special case).\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is strongly **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances 2, 4, and 6 are meta-directors. For these compounds, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct, so its yield will be very low. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring and directs to the meta position.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength for these groups is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   This means -NO2 is the strongest meta-director, followed by -COOH, and then -COOC2H5.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for nitrobenzene (4), then higher for benzoic acid (6), and slightly higher again for ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   So, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\nBased on typical experimental data:\n*   Bromination of Nitrobenzene (4) gives <1% para-isomer.\n*   Bromination of Benzoic acid (6) gives ~2% para-isomer.\n*   Bromination of Ethyl benzoate (2) gives a slightly higher percentage than benzoic acid, around 3-5%.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances 1, 3, and 5 are ortho, para-directors. For these compounds, the ortho and para isomers are the major products. The ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio) is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. The para-isomer yield is about 67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance strongly favors the para position. The para-isomer yield is very high, about 94%.\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** The chloro group's size is comparable to a methyl group, but its electronic properties also influence the p/o ratio. Experimentally, it is highly para-directing. The para-isomer yield is about 89%.\n\nComparing the para-yields for this group:\n*   Toluene (1): ~67%\n*   Chlorobenzene (3): ~89%\n*   Ethylbenzene (5): ~94%\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Orders**\n\nThe meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have significantly lower para-yields than the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 3, 5).\n\nCombining the two ordered sets:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\n\nLet's examine the options provided:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOur derived order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5. None of the options match this exactly. However, option C is the closest.\n\nLet's analyze Option C: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   The order of the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) is correct.\n*   The placement of the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors is correct.\n*   The placement of toluene (1) as the o,p-director with the lowest para-yield is correct.\n*   The only discrepancy is the relative order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). Option C suggests that chlorobenzene gives a higher para-yield than ethylbenzene (5 < 3), whereas our data shows the opposite (3 < 5).\n\nGiven that all other options contain more significant and fundamental errors (e.g., incorrect ordering of meta-directors), Option C is the most plausible answer. It is likely that there is a small error in the question's options, but it follows the correct chemical principles for most of the sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Question**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing yield of the *para*-substituted product. Since all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material have the same molar mass, the \"weight fraction of the yield\" is directly proportional to the \"mole fraction\" or \"percentage yield\" of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring determines the position of the incoming bromine atom. We need to classify each substituent as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups donate electron density to the ring (activating groups) or are halogens (deactivating but o,p-directing). They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (in Toluene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (in Ethylbenzene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (deactivating groups). They direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (in Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) `-COOH` (in Benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Substances within Each Group**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer, while substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce a significant amount. Therefore, the final order will be (meta-directors) < (ortho,para-directors).\n\n**A) Ordering the meta-directors (Substances 2, 4, 6):**\n\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is very low. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating and meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The `-COOC2H5` group is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` because the ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is weakly electron-donating, which slightly counteracts the withdrawal effect.\n\n*   Therefore, the percentage of para-product will be the lowest for the strongest deactivator and increase as the deactivating strength decreases.\n*   Order of increasing para-yield: **4 (`-NO2`) < 6 (`-COOH`) < 2 (`-COOC2H5`)**.\n\n**B) Ordering the ortho,para-directors (Substances 1, 3, 5):**\n\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is high. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio). This ratio is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the p/o ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). The increased bulk hinders the electrophile's approach to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. This leads to a higher para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: **1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** The chlorine atom is an o,p-director but is deactivating overall. It has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) and a weaker electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The strong -I effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Typically, the para-isomer yield for halobenzenes is exceptionally high, often higher than for alkylbenzenes. For bromination, chlorobenzene yields about 87% para-isomer, while toluene yields about 67%.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene will have the highest para-yield among this group.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: **1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`) < 3 (`-Cl`)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of m-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of o,p-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring directs the incoming bromine atom (Br+) to specific positions. We need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. These substances will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho, para.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. For these substances, the ortho and para isomers are formed in very small amounts, meaning their para-yield will be the lowest.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nBased on this classification, the substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer and will appear first in the list. The ortho, para-directors will have the highest yields and will appear last.\n\nThe overall order will look like: **(Meta-directors in order) < (Ortho, para-directors in order)**.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will more strongly direct to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nWe need to rank the deactivating strength of the -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5 groups.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also a strong deactivating group.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is deactivating, but generally considered less deactivating than -COOH.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the *reverse* order of this deactivating strength:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\n\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This ratio is heavily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1, -CH3) and Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk provides more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, which leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of para-yield is: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, they are known to give a very high yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. For example, the bromination of chlorobenzene yields approximately 87% of the para-isomer. This percentage is typically higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene. The electronic effects of the halogen's lone pairs strongly favor the para position.\n\nCombining these facts, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\nSo, the order is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Two Groups**\n\nNow we combine the ordered groups to get the final sequence:\n(Meta-directors) < (Ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) based on its effect on electrophilic substitution. Substituents can be either activating (and ortho,para-directing) or deactivating (and mostly meta-directing, with the exception of halogens).\n\n*   **Activating, ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n*   **Deactivating, ortho,para-directing group:** Halogens are a special case. They are deactivating due to their strong inductive effect but are ortho,para-directing due to their resonance effect. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**Step 2: Separate into low-yield and high-yield groups**\nBased on the directing effects, we can immediately say that the meta-directing substances will have a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho,para-directing substances.\n\n*   **Low para-yield group:** 2, 4, 6\n*   **High para-yield group:** 1, 3, 5\n\nThe final order will look like: (Order of 2, 4, 6) < (Order of 1, 3, 5).\n\n**Step 3: Order the low-yield (meta-directing) group**\nFor meta-directors, the amount of para-isomer formed is very small. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, leaving less for the para position.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The -COOH group is a stronger deactivator than the -COOC2H5 (ester) group because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing ability.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the high-yield (ortho,para-directing) group**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is the size (steric bulk) of the alkyl group. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene will give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) has a very strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution, even more so than for alkylbenzenes. The yield of para-bromochlorobenzene is typically very high (around 85-90%).\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene gives the highest yield of the para-isomer in this group.\n    *   **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the groups for the final order**\nBy combining the orders from Step 3 and Step 4, we get the final arrangement from lowest to highest para-isomer yield.\n\n*   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the isomer.\n\nHere is a substance-by-substance analysis based on the directing effects of their functional groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Deactivating):** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the para-isomer. The strength of the deactivating effect influences the selectivity for the meta position; stronger deactivators yield even less para-product.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a very strong deactivator and meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene almost exclusively yields the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer. Theoretical calculations show the para intermediate is significantly less stable than the meta intermediate.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivator and meta-director. Its deactivating effect is less than the nitro group, so it will produce a slightly higher, yet still very small, yield of the para-isomer compared to nitrobenzene.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is also a deactivating meta-director. It is generally considered a weaker deactivator than a carboxylic acid. For instance, in nitration reactions, ethyl benzoate yields about 5% of the para-isomer. This is expected to be the highest para yield among the three meta-directors.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups (Activating/Deactivating):** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products is largely determined by steric hindrance.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho, para-director. For bromination, the typical distribution gives a significant amount of para-isomer, around 33-40%.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is also an activating, ortho, para-director, similar to the methyl group. However, the ethyl group is larger, causing more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increased hindrance favors substitution at the para position, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director due to its lone pairs of electrons. Halogens are known to give a very high proportion of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. For example, the bromination of chlorobenzene can yield up to 87% of the para-isomer, which is the highest among this set of ortho, para-directors.\n\n**Summary of Isomer Yields:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can establish the following order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Lowest para yield due to the strongly deactivating -NO₂ group.\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low para yield, but slightly more than nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Low para yield, but the most of the meta-directors.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Significant para yield (~33-40%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Highest para yield (~87%) due to the electronic properties of the chloro substituent.\n\nTherefore, the final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe correct sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. The formation of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituent is ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing, and by steric hindrance at the ortho position.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the substituents:\n*   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4), -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6), and -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** These are deactivating, meta-directing groups. They withdraw electron density from the ring, making electrophilic substitution difficult and directing the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low for these substances.\n    *   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups, resulting in a para-isomer yield of less than 1%.\n    *   The -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups are also strongly deactivating. For ethyl benzoate, the para-isomer yield is around 5%, while the meta-isomer is the major product (73%). For benzoic acid, the para yield is also very small, with the vast majority being the meta-isomer. Comparing the three, the order of increasing para yield is generally considered to be nitrobenzene < benzoic acid < ethyl benzoate, although all are very low.\n\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1), -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5), and -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** These are ortho-, para-directing groups. They will all produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. The specific yield of the para-isomer versus the ortho-isomer is largely determined by steric effects.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is activating and directs to the ortho and para positions. In bromination, toluene typically yields about 30-40% ortho-isomer and the rest is almost all para-isomer, giving a para yield of about 60-70%.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is also activating and ortho-, para-directing. Because the ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, it creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increased hindrance favors substitution at the less crowded para position, resulting in a higher para-isomer yield compared to toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is deactivating overall but is ortho-, para-directing due to its lone pairs participating in resonance. The para-isomer is strongly favored, with conventional bromination yielding an ortho to para isomer ratio of about 0.1 to 1, which corresponds to approximately 9% ortho and 91% para.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Has the lowest para yield (<1%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Has a very low para yield, slightly higher than nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Has a very low para yield (around 5%), but generally slightly higher than benzoic acid.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Has a substantial para yield (~60-70%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Has a higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Has the highest para yield (~91%) due to a strong preference for para substitution.\n\nThus, the final order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to consider the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nThe substituents can be classified based on their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (deactivating):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The substances with these groups are:\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is a very strong deactivating, meta-director. It produces almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the ortho and para products.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n    Among these three, the nitro group is one of the strongest meta-directors, leading to a very low para yield. The ester and carboxylic acid groups are also strongly meta-directing. For nitration of a benzoic ester, the para yield is about 5%. For the bromination of nitrobenzene, the reaction requires harsh conditions and yields predominantly the meta isomer. The para yield for all three will be very low, with nitrobenzene expected to be the lowest. Following nitrobenzene, the ester and carboxylic acid groups will also have very low para yields.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce significantly higher yields of the para-isomer compared to meta-directors.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, ortho, para-director. Due to its small size, it allows for a significant amount of ortho substitution, but the para isomer is also a major product.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is also an activating, ortho, para-director. It is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming electrophile. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, but ortho, para-director. Halogens generally lead to a high yield of the para-isomer, often more so than simple alkyl groups, due to a combination of electronic and steric effects. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene gives a 70% yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Establishing the Order\n\n1.  **Lowest Para Yields (Meta-directors):** The lowest yields of the para-isomer will come from the meta-directing groups. The order among them, from lowest to highest para yield, is generally based on the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing nature.\n    *   Nitrobenzene (4) is extremely deactivating and gives a negligible para yield.\n    *   Ethyl benzoate (2) and Benzoic acid (6) are also strongly deactivating. Data for the nitration of ethyl benzoate shows a 5% para yield. The deactivating strength of -COOH and -COOR are comparable.\n    *   Therefore, the order for the lowest para yields is: **4 < 2 ≈ 6**.\n\n2.  **Highest Para Yields (Ortho, para-directors):** Now we order the o,p-directors.\n    *   Comparing toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5), the bulkier ethyl group in (5) sterically hinders the ortho positions more than the methyl group in (1). This results in a higher proportion of the para product for ethylbenzene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   Comparing the alkylbenzenes to chlorobenzene (3), halogens are known to give high para-to-ortho ratios. The nitration of chlorobenzene, for instance, yields 70% para-product, while the nitration of toluene yields 37% para-product. This suggests that chlorobenzene will have a higher para-isomer yield than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order for the highest para yields is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n3.  **Combining the Groups:** Combining the two groups, we need to place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors. The question asks for an increasing order of the *weight fraction* of the para-isomer. Based on typical isomer distributions, there is a significant gap between the para yield from meta-directors and ortho, para-directors.\n\nThe final combined order is determined by arranging the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors, each subgroup ordered by increasing para yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (lowest para yield):** 4 (-NO2) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 6 (-COOH). The relative order of 2 and 6 can be debated without precise data for bromination, but they are very close and both are significantly lower than the o,p-directors. Let's check the options. Option C suggests 4 < 2 < 6. Option D suggests 4 < 6 < 2.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (highest para yield):** 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the meta-directors. The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator. Between -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating strengths are similar. Let's look at the provided options to resolve the ambiguity.\n\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Decreasing order)\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect grouping)\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect order for o,p directors)\n*   D) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (Correct grouping and plausible internal order)\n\nLet's analyze option D: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   **Meta-directors:** 4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5). This order is plausible for the very low para yields.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl). This order is consistent with our analysis based on steric hindrance and the known high para-selectivity for halogens.\n\nThe order presented in option D aligns well with established principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The meta-directors produce the least para-isomer, with the strongly deactivating nitro group producing the absolute least. The ortho, para-directors produce the most, with the yield increasing as ortho-attack is sterically disfavored (-CH3 < -C2H5) and with the electronically favored para-direction of halogens (-Cl being the highest).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield, a step-by-step analysis of the substituent effects in electrophilic bromination is required.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to categorize the substituents on the benzene ring as either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*. This initial classification separates the substances into two groups: those that will produce a high yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a very low yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, meaning the para-isomer is only a minor byproduct.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nFrom this classification, we know the final sequence must place substances 4, 6, and 2 before substances 1, 5, and 3.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor the meta-directors (4, 6, 2), the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The accepted order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   The -NO₂ group is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n*   The -COOH group is strongly deactivating.\n*   The -COOC₂H₅ (ester) group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) slightly mitigates the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n*   The correct order of increasing para-yield is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3), the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho products. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 and 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃) in substance 1. This increased size creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with Halogen (3):** The chlorine atom in substance 3 is deactivating but ortho, para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I effect) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~87-89%) is typically higher than for toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   The correct order of increasing para-yield is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we establish the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n*   The complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring with different substituents. We need to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-monobromo derivative. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same for a given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring can be classified based on their directing effect in electrophilic substitution:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They generally have a high yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will have a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's classify the given substituents:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:**\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Meta-directors:**\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n**3. Initial Ordering**\n\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-product, and ortho, para-directors produce a significant amount, we can immediately say that the substances with meta-directing groups will come first in the list (lowest para yield), followed by the substances with ortho, para-directing groups.\n\nOrder: {4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is very small. The order depends on the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group makes the ring less reactive and more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the ortho and para isomers.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It will produce the lowest amount of para-product.\n*   **-COOH (6) and -COOC2H5 (2):** Both are strongly deactivating, but less so than -NO2. The -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOC2H5 group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C2H5) in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power of the carbonyl group.\n\nTherefore, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\nThis means the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order: -NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5.\nSo, the order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-product to the ortho-product. A higher para/ortho ratio means a higher overall percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** This is a relatively small group. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products, with the para-isomer being favored (typically ~67% para).\n*   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance makes attack at the ortho positions more difficult, thus increasing the proportion of the para-product compared to toluene. So, the para yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene.\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director, but it's deactivating. Its strong inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance, strongly favors the para position. The para yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is very high (typically ~87%). This yield is generally higher than that for ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\nSo, the order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nFinal Order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their electronic effects and directing properties:\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the benzene ring, increasing its reactivity towards electrophiles and directing substitution to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but still direct incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it much less reactive and directing substitution to the meta position. Consequently, they produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### **Ordering the Substances**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer, while those with ortho/para-directing groups will have the highest.\n\n#### **1. Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor nitrobenzene (4), benzoic acid (6), and ethyl benzoate (2), the major product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is minimal. The order among these is determined by the strength of the deactivating effect.\n\n*   **Nitrobenzene (-NO2, 4):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para product (around 0-5%).\n*   **Benzoic acid (-COOH, 6):** The carboxylic acid group is also strongly deactivating. The para-isomer yield is very low, typically around 1-2%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5, 2):** The ester group is a strong deactivator, similar to a carboxylic acid. Data for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows about 5% para-product, which is slightly higher than for the other meta-directors.\n\nBased on the deactivating strength and typical isomer distributions, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n#### **2. Ortho/Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the major products are the ortho and para isomers. The ratio between them is determined primarily by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n\n*   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. Conventional bromination of toluene yields about 30-40% ortho-isomer and 60-70% para-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For example, in mercuration, the para-product percentage increases from 79.2% for toluene to 83.2% for ethylbenzene. A similar trend is expected for bromination.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is an ortho/para-director. While deactivating, it gives a very high yield of the para-isomer upon bromination, around 89%.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we need to arrange the given benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. The weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Directing Effects:** First, we'll classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n    *   *Ortho, para-directors* yield a high percentage of the para-isomer.\n    *   *Meta-directors* yield a very low percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n2.  **Group the Substances:**\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), -Cl (3).\n    *   **Meta-directors:** -NO2 (4), -COOC2H5 (2), -COOH (6).\n    This means the final sequence will have substances 4, 2, and 6 at the beginning (in some order) and 1, 5, and 3 at the end (in some order).\n\n3.  **Order the Meta-Directors:** For meta-directors, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield decreases as the deactivating (and meta-directing) strength of the group increases.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors:** For these, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the para/ortho ratio, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** Gives a high para yield (~67%), but generally the lowest among these three due to its relatively small size allowing for more ortho attack.\n    *   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than methyl, causing more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increases the para-isomer yield compared to toluene.\n    *   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** While halogens are deactivating, they are strongly para-directing. Literature data often shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~89%) is very high, even slightly higher than for bulky alkyl groups like tert-butylbenzene (~88%). This suggests the order of increasing para yield is Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    *   Thus, the order is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n5.  **Combine the Orders:** By combining the two groups, we get the final sequence.\n    *   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n    *   The complete order is: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** This sequence matches option C. The following Python code will verify this logic by sorting the substances based on their approximate para-isomer yields.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by ordering substances based on the para-isomer yield\n    in electrophilic bromination.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define substances with their number, name, and directing group type.\n    # We also assign an approximate para-isomer percentage yield based on chemical principles and literature data.\n    # C6H5- means a benzene ring.\n    # 1) С6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n    # 2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    # 3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    # 4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    # 5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n    # 6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n    substances = {\n        1: {'name': 'Toluene', 'group': '-CH3', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 67},\n        2: {'name': 'Ethyl benzoate', 'group': '-COOC2H5', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 4},\n        3: {'name': 'Chlorobenzene', 'group': '-Cl', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 89},\n        4: {'name': 'Nitrobenzene', 'group': '-NO2', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 1},\n        5: {'name': 'Ethylbenzene', 'group': '-C2H5', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 85}, # Less than Cl, more than CH3\n        6: {'name': 'Benzoic acid', 'group': '-COOH', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 2}\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Sort the substances based on their para-isomer yield in increasing order.\n    # The sorted() function takes a list of items and a key.

The substituent already on the benzene ring (C6H5-) directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) to specific positions. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the nature of this substituent.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents**\nWe need to classify the substituents into two main categories:\n1.  **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The products are a mixture of ortho and para isomers.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl group)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl group)\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro group)\n2.  **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is formed in very small amounts.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro group)\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxyl group)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ester group)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the para-isomer yield for meta-directors**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring towards ortho/para attack.\n*   The deactivating strength of these groups follows the order: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, so it will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The -COOC2H5 group is the weakest deactivator among the three, so it will give the highest yield of the para-isomer among this group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the para-isomer yield for ortho, para-directors**\nSubstances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 3, 5) will have much higher yields of the para-isomer. The distribution between the ortho and para positions depends on steric and electronic factors. A higher para/ortho ratio leads to a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The para position is sterically unhindered, while the ortho positions are adjacent to the substituent. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer. The order of steric bulk is: -C2H5 > -CH3 > -Cl.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** For halogens like -Cl, a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates the ortho position more than the para position, which also favors para substitution.\n*   **Comparing the groups:**\n    *   **-CH3 (1):** The methyl group has moderate steric bulk. The para-isomer is favored over the ortho, but the ortho product is still significant. (Para yield is ~67%).\n    *   **-Cl (3):** The combination of steric hindrance and the strong deactivating inductive effect at the ortho position makes the para-isomer highly favored. (Para yield is ~87%).\n    *   **-C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group is significantly bulkier than the methyl group. This large steric hindrance makes the para-isomer extremely favored. (Para yield is ~94%).\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is: 1 < 3 < 5.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results to get the final order**\nWe combine the two groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 3 < 5\n*   Combining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the given options**\nLet's check the provided options against our derived correct order (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5).\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect.\n*   B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - This option correctly orders the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) and correctly identifies toluene (1) as the least para-selective of the o,p-directors. However, it incorrectly swaps the order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). The correct order is 3 < 5, not 5 < 3.\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect.\n*   D) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect.\n\nAmong the given choices, option B is the closest to the chemically correct order. It correctly orders the first four substances in the sequence (4 < 6 < 2 < 1). The only error is the relative order of the last two substances. In the context of a multiple-choice question with a likely error, this is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attack and the rate of the reaction.\n\n*   **Activating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating\n*   **Deactivating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but have lone pairs that can donate through resonance, directing the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate)\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro)\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Separate into low-yield and high-yield groups**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can separate the substances into two groups:\n*   **Low para-yield group (meta-directors):** For these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The main product is the meta-isomer. This group includes substances 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **High para-yield group (ortho/para-directors):** For these substances, the para-isomer is a major product, along with the ortho-isomer. This group includes substances 1, 3, and 5.\n\nThe final ordered list will have all the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho/para-directors.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within the low-yield (meta-directing) group**\n\nThe substances are 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), and 2 (-COOC2H5). For these meta-directors, the amount of para-product formed is inversely proportional to the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will lead to a higher percentage of the meta-isomer and consequently a lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is one of the strongest deactivators, followed by carboxylic acid, and then the ester).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within the high-yield (ortho/para-directing) group**\n\nThe substances are 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), and 3 (-Cl). The yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing 1 (-CH3) and 5 (-C2H5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is their size. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This larger size creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position relatively more accessible for the incoming bromine. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** The chloro group is deactivating but directs ortho/para. For halogens, electronic factors cause a strong preference for substitution at the para position compared to the ortho position. The deactivating inductive effect is felt more strongly at the ortho position than the para position. This leads to a very high para/ortho ratio. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% of the para-isomer, which is higher than the yield from toluene (about 67%). It is also expected to be higher than the yield from ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest para-isomer yield in this group.\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups to get the final order**\n\nWe combine the ordered low-yield group and the ordered high-yield group. The para-yield for any ortho/para-director will be significantly greater than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Low-yield order: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   High-yield order: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5 < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived order matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two groups: ortho-, para-directing and meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves.\n    *   1) **-CH3** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low.\n    *   4) **-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Ordering the Substances**\n\n**1. Meta-directing groups (Lowest para-yield):**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4):** The -NO2 group is a very strong deactivating, meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene requires harsh conditions and yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer (m-bromonitrobenzene). The para-isomer yield is negligible, often less than 1%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2) and Benzoic acid (6):** The -COOC2H5 and -COOH groups are also deactivating and meta-directing. While still producing very low amounts of the para-isomer, they are generally less deactivating than the nitro group. For bromination of benzoic acid, the distribution is approximately 75-80% meta, 20-25% ortho, and only a very small fraction (1-2%) para. The ester group (-COOC2H5) behaves similarly to the carboxylic acid group.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield among the meta-directors is: **4 (-NO2) < 2 (-COOC2H5) ≈ 6 (-COOH)**. The options provided distinguish between 2 and 6, and typically the ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid, but both result in very low para yields. Based on typical data, the order is generally considered **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-directing groups (Highest para-yield):**\n\nFor these groups, the formation of the para-isomer is favored, and the yield is influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3):** The -Cl group is ortho-, para-directing. For bromination, the para-isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk and electronic effect of the chlorine atom. The typical distribution for bromination gives a high yield of the para-isomer, often around 87-90%.\n*   **Toluene (1):** The -CH3 group is less sterically hindering than -Cl or -C2H5. During bromination, it yields a significant amount of both ortho and para products. The para-isomer yield is typically around 33-40%.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5):** The -C2H5 group is bulkier than the -CH3 group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a greater preference for para-substitution compared to toluene. The para-isomer yield for bromination of ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene, typically around 40-50%.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield among the ortho-, para-directors is: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**.\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Lowest yield (<1%).\n2.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Very low yield (~1-2%).\n3.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low yield (~1-2%, slightly different from the ester).\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Moderate para yield (~33-40%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to sterics (~40-50%).\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Highest para yield (~87-90%).\n\nThe complete sequence is **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Incorrect - reverse order)\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect)\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect)\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (This order is very close to our derived order, with a slight swap of 2 and 6, which have very similar and low para yields).\n\nLet's re-examine the order of 2 and 6. Both -COOH and -COOC2H5 are strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Their para yields are minimal and very close. The provided options suggest a specific order. Let's assume the order in option D is the intended one.\n\nFinal Order based on analysis and matching with options: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Analysis of Substituent Effects on Electrophilic Bromination\n\nTo arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must first classify the substituents on the benzene ring. These substituents determine the reaction's regioselectivity, directing the incoming bromine to specific positions (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**1. Classification of Substituents:**\n\nThe substituents are classified based on their electronic effects (activating or deactivating) and their directing influence (ortho/para or meta).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the benzene ring, making it more reactive. They direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH₃ (Toluene, 1):** Alkyl group, activating.\n    *   **-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Alkyl group, activating.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** Halogens are electron-withdrawing via induction (deactivating) but can donate electrons via resonance, which directs substitution to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Halogen, deactivating.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw significant electron density from the ring, making it less reactive and directing the electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating.\n    *   **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating.\n\n**2. Isomer Distribution and Para-Yield:**\n\nThe percentage of the para-isomer formed depends on the nature of the substituent.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 2, 6):** For nitrobenzene (4), ethyl benzoate (2), and benzoic acid (6), the primary product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low. For instance, the nitration of ethyl benzoate yields only 5% of the para-isomer, with the majority being the meta-product (73%). Similarly, the bromination of nitrobenzene almost exclusively produces the meta-isomer. Therefore, these three substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields. Among these, the deactivating strength generally follows the order -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅, which correlates with lower ortho/para substitution. Thus, the para yield order is expected to be 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n*   **Ortho/Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3):** For toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the substitution occurs at the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products is influenced by steric hindrance.\n    *   **-CH₃ and -C₂H₅:** Alkyl groups are ortho/para directors. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions in ethylbenzene favors substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) is expected to have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). For example, in nitration, toluene gives 37% para-product, while the more sterically hindered tert-butylbenzene gives 75% para-product.\n    *   **-Cl:** The chloro group is also an ortho/para director. Halogens typically yield a high percentage of the para-isomer due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene results in 70% para-product. In bromination, chlorobenzene shows high selectivity for the para position, with yields over 95% under certain conditions. This strong preference for the para position is generally higher than for simple alkylbenzenes.\n\n**3. Final Ordering:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can establish the order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Lowest Yields (Meta-Directors):** The deactivating, meta-directing groups will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer. The order among them, from lowest to highest para yield, is generally accepted as: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n2.  **Intermediate Yields (Ortho/Para-Directors):** The activating alkyl groups will produce significant amounts of para-isomer. Due to less steric hindrance, toluene (1) will have a lower para-to-ortho ratio compared to the bulkier ethylbenzene (5). Thus, the order is Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n3.  **Highest Yield (Ortho/Para-Director):** The chloro group in chlorobenzene (3) strongly directs substitution to the para position, often with very high selectivity, surpassing that of the alkylbenzenes.\n\nCombining these groups, the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing.\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the positions ortho and para to themselves. Generally, these will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH3** (Methyl): Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   5) **-C2H5** (Ethyl): Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chloro): Deactivating, but ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. They produce very little para-isomer, so their para-isomer yield will be the lowest.\n    *   4) **-NO2** (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5** (Ethyl ester): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### Step 2: Rank the Meta-Directors\n\nThe meta-directing substituents will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer. For these compounds, the vast majority of the product will be the meta-isomer.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4, C6H5-NO2):** The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating, meta-directing groups. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-product, with para-isomer yields being negligible, often less than 1%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2, C6H5-COOC2H5):** The ester group is also deactivating and meta-directing. Data for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows it yields predominantly the meta-product (73%), with a small amount of para-isomer (5%).\n*   **Benzoic acid (6, C6H5-COOH):** The carboxylic acid group is deactivating and meta-directing, similar to the ester group.\n\nComparing these three, the -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, leading to the lowest overall yield and the lowest proportion of the para-isomer. Between -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating effects are comparable, but both will produce significantly more para-isomer than the -NO2 group. Generally, the order of para-isomer yield will be: **-NO2 < -COOC2H5 ≈ -COOH**. Therefore, the beginning of our sequence is **4 < 2 ≈ 6**.\n\n### Step 3: Rank the Ortho-, Para-Directors\n\nFor the ortho-, para-directing substituents (-Cl, -CH3, -C2H5), the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ortho-to-para ratio. This ratio is primarily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-product.\n\nLet's compare the steric bulk of these groups:\n*   **-CH3 (Methyl):** This is a relatively small alkyl group.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethyl):** This group is larger than the methyl group.\n*   **-Cl (Chloro):** This is a single atom.\n\nThe steric hindrance increases in the order: **-Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5**.\n*   **Toluene (1, C6H5-CH3):** The bromination of toluene yields about 66.8% para-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5, C6H5-C2H5):** Due to the larger size of the ethyl group compared to the methyl group, there is more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This favors the formation of the para-isomer even more than in toluene. Nitration data, for example, shows that the para-isomer percentage increases from 37% for toluene to 49% for ethylbenzene. A similar trend is expected for bromination.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3, C6H5-Cl):** While the chloro group is ortho-, para-directing, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect deactivates the ring. However, the key factor for the *ratio* is sterics. The chlorine atom is sterically less demanding than a methyl group. However, experimental data for halogenation of chlorobenzene often shows a high percentage of the para-isomer, sometimes as high as 70% for nitration. For bromination, the para-isomer is also heavily favored.\n\nLet's refine the order based on typical isomer distributions:\n*   The para-isomer yield increases as the steric bulk of the alkyl group increases: **-CH3 < -C2H5**.\n*   Comparing the alkyl groups to the chloro group, halogenation of chlorobenzene typically results in a very high para-isomer yield, often higher than for toluene and ethylbenzene under similar conditions. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene gives about 64-70% para-isomer, while for toluene it's about 37% and ethylbenzene about 49%. This suggests the order of para-yield is **-CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Rankings\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **4 (C6H5-NO2):** Lowest yield (meta-director, strong deactivator).\n2.  **2 (C6H5-COOC2H5):** Very low yield (meta-director).\n3.  **6 (C6H5-COOH):** Very low yield (meta-director, similar to 2).\n4.  **1 (C6H5-CH3):** Significant para yield, but less than 5 and 3 due to lower steric hindrance.\n5.  **5 (C6H5-C2H5):** Higher para yield than 1 due to increased steric hindrance.\n6.  **3 (C6H5-Cl):** Highest para yield among the o,p-directors.\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nLooking at the options, this does not perfectly match any of them. Let's re-evaluate the order of 2 and 6. The -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups have similar deactivating strengths. Without precise experimental data for bromination of both under identical conditions, their relative order is ambiguous but they will be close and occupy the positions after -NO2.\n\nLet's re-examine the options provided:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOption B starts with the meta-directors (4, 2, 6) and ends with the ortho, para-directors (3, 1, 5). Let's analyze the order within these groups in option B.\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 2 < 6**. This is plausible, with NO2 giving the least para-product.\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: **3 < 1 < 5**. This implies the para yield is Cl < CH3 < C2H5. This contradicts our analysis based on steric hindrance and literature data, which suggests the para-yield increases with steric bulk (CH3 < C2H5) and that halogens often give a high para ratio.\n\nLet's reconsider the steric hindrance argument. The primary factor for the ortho/para ratio is the size of the substituent.\n*   Size: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl.\n*   This would lead to a para-isomer yield order of: Cl < CH3 < C2H5.\nThis matches the order in option B: **3 < 1 < 5**.\n\nLet's combine this with the meta-directors. The deactivating strength is generally considered -NO2 > -COOR > -COOH. This would mean the para-yield is **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\nCombining these two orderings gives: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**. This matches option B exactly.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n*   **Lowest para yield:** Meta-directors. Order based on deactivating strength: NO2 > COOC2H5 > COOH. So, para yield is 4 < 2 < 6.\n*   **Highest para yield:** Ortho, para-directors. Order based on increasing steric hindrance favoring the para position: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl. So, para yield is 3 < 1 < 5.\n*   **Combined:** 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5.\n\nThis provides a consistent rationale for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring (C6H5-X). The substituent (X) on the ring determines two things:\n1.  **Reactivity:** Whether the ring reacts faster (activating group) or slower (deactivating group) than benzene itself.\n2.  **Orientation:** Where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add. Substituents are either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\nThe question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance:\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is **deactivating** but **ortho, para-directing** (a special case).\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is strongly **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho, para-directing**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances 2, 4, and 6 are meta-directors. For these compounds, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct, so its yield will be very low. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring and directs to the meta position.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength for these groups is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   This means -NO2 is the strongest meta-director, followed by -COOH, and then -COOC2H5.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for nitrobenzene (4), then higher for benzoic acid (6), and slightly higher again for ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   So, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\nBased on typical experimental data:\n*   Bromination of Nitrobenzene (4) gives <1% para-isomer.\n*   Bromination of Benzoic acid (6) gives ~2% para-isomer.\n*   Bromination of Ethyl benzoate (2) gives a slightly higher percentage than benzoic acid, around 3-5%.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances 1, 3, and 5 are ortho, para-directors. For these compounds, the ortho and para isomers are the major products. The ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio) is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. The para-isomer yield is about 67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance strongly favors the para position. The para-isomer yield is very high, about 94%.\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** The chloro group's size is comparable to a methyl group, but its electronic properties also influence the p/o ratio. Experimentally, it is highly para-directing. The para-isomer yield is about 89%.\n\nComparing the para-yields for this group:\n*   Toluene (1): ~67%\n*   Chlorobenzene (3): ~89%\n*   Ethylbenzene (5): ~94%\n\nThe order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Orders**\n\nThe meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have significantly lower para-yields than the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 3, 5).\n\nCombining the two ordered sets:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\n\nLet's examine the options provided:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOur derived order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5. None of the options match this exactly. However, option C is the closest.\n\nLet's analyze Option C: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   The order of the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) is correct.\n*   The placement of the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors is correct.\n*   The placement of toluene (1) as the o,p-director with the lowest para-yield is correct.\n*   The only discrepancy is the relative order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). Option C suggests that chlorobenzene gives a higher para-yield than ethylbenzene (5 < 3), whereas our data shows the opposite (3 < 5).\n\nGiven that all other options contain more significant and fundamental errors (e.g., incorrect ordering of meta-directors), Option C is the most plausible answer. It is likely that there is a small error in the question's options, but it follows the correct chemical principles for most of the sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Question**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing yield of the *para*-substituted product. Since all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material have the same molar mass, the \"weight fraction of the yield\" is directly proportional to the \"mole fraction\" or \"percentage yield\" of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring determines the position of the incoming bromine atom. We need to classify each substituent as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups donate electron density to the ring (activating groups) or are halogens (deactivating but o,p-directing). They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (in Toluene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (in Ethylbenzene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (deactivating groups). They direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (in Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) `-COOH` (in Benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Substances within Each Group**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer, while substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce a significant amount. Therefore, the final order will be (meta-directors) < (ortho,para-directors).\n\n**A) Ordering the meta-directors (Substances 2, 4, 6):**\n\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is very low. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating and meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The `-COOC2H5` group is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` because the ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is weakly electron-donating, which slightly counteracts the withdrawal effect.\n\n*   Therefore, the percentage of para-product will be the lowest for the strongest deactivator and increase as the deactivating strength decreases.\n*   Order of increasing para-yield: **4 (`-NO2`) < 6 (`-COOH`) < 2 (`-COOC2H5`)**.\n\n**B) Ordering the ortho,para-directors (Substances 1, 3, 5):**\n\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is high. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio). This ratio is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the p/o ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). The increased bulk hinders the electrophile's approach to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. This leads to a higher para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: **1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** The chlorine atom is an o,p-director but is deactivating overall. It has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) and a weaker electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The strong -I effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Typically, the para-isomer yield for halobenzenes is exceptionally high, often higher than for alkylbenzenes. For bromination, chlorobenzene yields about 87% para-isomer, while toluene yields about 67%.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene will have the highest para-yield among this group.\n    *   Order of increasing para-yield: **1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`) < 3 (`-Cl`)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of m-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of o,p-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring directs the incoming bromine atom (Br+) to specific positions. We need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. These substances will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho, para.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. For these substances, the ortho and para isomers are formed in very small amounts, meaning their para-yield will be the lowest.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nBased on this classification, the substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer and will appear first in the list. The ortho, para-directors will have the highest yields and will appear last.\n\nThe overall order will look like: **(Meta-directors in order) < (Ortho, para-directors in order)**.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will more strongly direct to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nWe need to rank the deactivating strength of the -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5 groups.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also a strong deactivating group.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is deactivating, but generally considered less deactivating than -COOH.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the *reverse* order of this deactivating strength:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\n\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This ratio is heavily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1, -CH3) and Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk provides more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, which leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of para-yield is: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, they are known to give a very high yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. For example, the bromination of chlorobenzene yields approximately 87% of the para-isomer. This percentage is typically higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene. The electronic effects of the halogen's lone pairs strongly favor the para position.\n\nCombining these facts, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\nSo, the order is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Two Groups**\n\nNow we combine the ordered groups to get the final sequence:\n(Meta-directors) < (Ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) based on its effect on electrophilic substitution. Substituents can be either activating (and ortho,para-directing) or deactivating (and mostly meta-directing, with the exception of halogens).\n\n*   **Activating, ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n*   **Deactivating, ortho,para-directing group:** Halogens are a special case. They are deactivating due to their strong inductive effect but are ortho,para-directing due to their resonance effect. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**Step 2: Separate into low-yield and high-yield groups**\nBased on the directing effects, we can immediately say that the meta-directing substances will have a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho,para-directing substances.\n\n*   **Low para-yield group:** 2, 4, 6\n*   **High para-yield group:** 1, 3, 5\n\nThe final order will look like: (Order of 2, 4, 6) < (Order of 1, 3, 5).\n\n**Step 3: Order the low-yield (meta-directing) group**\nFor meta-directors, the amount of para-isomer formed is very small. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, leaving less for the para position.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The -COOH group is a stronger deactivator than the -COOC2H5 (ester) group because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing ability.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the high-yield (ortho,para-directing) group**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is the size (steric bulk) of the alkyl group. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene will give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) has a very strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution, even more so than for alkylbenzenes. The yield of para-bromochlorobenzene is typically very high (around 85-90%).\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene gives the highest yield of the para-isomer in this group.\n    *   **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the groups for the final order**\nBy combining the orders from Step 3 and Step 4, we get the final arrangement from lowest to highest para-isomer yield.\n\n*   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the isomer.\n\nHere is a substance-by-substance analysis based on the directing effects of their functional groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Deactivating):** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the para-isomer. The strength of the deactivating effect influences the selectivity for the meta position; stronger deactivators yield even less para-product.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a very strong deactivator and meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene almost exclusively yields the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer. Theoretical calculations show the para intermediate is significantly less stable than the meta intermediate.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivator and meta-director. Its deactivating effect is less than the nitro group, so it will produce a slightly higher, yet still very small, yield of the para-isomer compared to nitrobenzene.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is also a deactivating meta-director. It is generally considered a weaker deactivator than a carboxylic acid. For instance, in nitration reactions, ethyl benzoate yields about 5% of the para-isomer. This is expected to be the highest para yield among the three meta-directors.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups (Activating/Deactivating):** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products is largely determined by steric hindrance.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho, para-director. For bromination, the typical distribution gives a significant amount of para-isomer, around 33-40%.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is also an activating, ortho, para-director, similar to the methyl group. However, the ethyl group is larger, causing more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increased hindrance favors substitution at the para position, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director due to its lone pairs of electrons. Halogens are known to give a very high proportion of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. For example, the bromination of chlorobenzene can yield up to 87% of the para-isomer, which is the highest among this set of ortho, para-directors.\n\n**Summary of Isomer Yields:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can establish the following order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Lowest para yield due to the strongly deactivating -NO₂ group.\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low para yield, but slightly more than nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Low para yield, but the most of the meta-directors.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Significant para yield (~33-40%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Highest para yield (~87%) due to the electronic properties of the chloro substituent.\n\nTherefore, the final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe correct sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. The formation of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituent is ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing, and by steric hindrance at the ortho position.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the substituents:\n*   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4), -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6), and -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** These are deactivating, meta-directing groups. They withdraw electron density from the ring, making electrophilic substitution difficult and directing the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low for these substances.\n    *   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups, resulting in a para-isomer yield of less than 1%.\n    *   The -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups are also strongly deactivating. For ethyl benzoate, the para-isomer yield is around 5%, while the meta-isomer is the major product (73%). For benzoic acid, the para yield is also very small, with the vast majority being the meta-isomer. Comparing the three, the order of increasing para yield is generally considered to be nitrobenzene < benzoic acid < ethyl benzoate, although all are very low.\n\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1), -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5), and -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** These are ortho-, para-directing groups. They will all produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. The specific yield of the para-isomer versus the ortho-isomer is largely determined by steric effects.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is activating and directs to the ortho and para positions. In bromination, toluene typically yields about 30-40% ortho-isomer and the rest is almost all para-isomer, giving a para yield of about 60-70%.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is also activating and ortho-, para-directing. Because the ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, it creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increased hindrance favors substitution at the less crowded para position, resulting in a higher para-isomer yield compared to toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is deactivating overall but is ortho-, para-directing due to its lone pairs participating in resonance. The para-isomer is strongly favored, with conventional bromination yielding an ortho to para isomer ratio of about 0.1 to 1, which corresponds to approximately 9% ortho and 91% para.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Has the lowest para yield (<1%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Has a very low para yield, slightly higher than nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Has a very low para yield (around 5%), but generally slightly higher than benzoic acid.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Has a substantial para yield (~60-70%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Has a higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Has the highest para yield (~91%) due to a strong preference for para substitution.\n\nThus, the final order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to consider the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nThe substituents can be classified based on their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (deactivating):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The substances with these groups are:\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is a very strong deactivating, meta-director. It produces almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the ortho and para products.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n    Among these three, the nitro group is one of the strongest meta-directors, leading to a very low para yield. The ester and carboxylic acid groups are also strongly meta-directing. For nitration of a benzoic ester, the para yield is about 5%. For the bromination of nitrobenzene, the reaction requires harsh conditions and yields predominantly the meta isomer. The para yield for all three will be very low, with nitrobenzene expected to be the lowest. Following nitrobenzene, the ester and carboxylic acid groups will also have very low para yields.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce significantly higher yields of the para-isomer compared to meta-directors.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, ortho, para-director. Due to its small size, it allows for a significant amount of ortho substitution, but the para isomer is also a major product.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is also an activating, ortho, para-director. It is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming electrophile. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, but ortho, para-director. Halogens generally lead to a high yield of the para-isomer, often more so than simple alkyl groups, due to a combination of electronic and steric effects. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene gives a 70% yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Establishing the Order\n\n1.  **Lowest Para Yields (Meta-directors):** The lowest yields of the para-isomer will come from the meta-directing groups. The order among them, from lowest to highest para yield, is generally based on the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing nature.\n    *   Nitrobenzene (4) is extremely deactivating and gives a negligible para yield.\n    *   Ethyl benzoate (2) and Benzoic acid (6) are also strongly deactivating. Data for the nitration of ethyl benzoate shows a 5% para yield. The deactivating strength of -COOH and -COOR are comparable.\n    *   Therefore, the order for the lowest para yields is: **4 < 2 ≈ 6**.\n\n2.  **Highest Para Yields (Ortho, para-directors):** Now we order the o,p-directors.\n    *   Comparing toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5), the bulkier ethyl group in (5) sterically hinders the ortho positions more than the methyl group in (1). This results in a higher proportion of the para product for ethylbenzene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   Comparing the alkylbenzenes to chlorobenzene (3), halogens are known to give high para-to-ortho ratios. The nitration of chlorobenzene, for instance, yields 70% para-product, while the nitration of toluene yields 37% para-product. This suggests that chlorobenzene will have a higher para-isomer yield than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order for the highest para yields is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n3.  **Combining the Groups:** Combining the two groups, we need to place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors. The question asks for an increasing order of the *weight fraction* of the para-isomer. Based on typical isomer distributions, there is a significant gap between the para yield from meta-directors and ortho, para-directors.\n\nThe final combined order is determined by arranging the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors, each subgroup ordered by increasing para yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (lowest para yield):** 4 (-NO2) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 6 (-COOH). The relative order of 2 and 6 can be debated without precise data for bromination, but they are very close and both are significantly lower than the o,p-directors. Let's check the options. Option C suggests 4 < 2 < 6. Option D suggests 4 < 6 < 2.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (highest para yield):** 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the meta-directors. The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator. Between -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating strengths are similar. Let's look at the provided options to resolve the ambiguity.\n\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Decreasing order)\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect grouping)\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect order for o,p directors)\n*   D) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (Correct grouping and plausible internal order)\n\nLet's analyze option D: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   **Meta-directors:** 4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5). This order is plausible for the very low para yields.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl). This order is consistent with our analysis based on steric hindrance and the known high para-selectivity for halogens.\n\nThe order presented in option D aligns well with established principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The meta-directors produce the least para-isomer, with the strongly deactivating nitro group producing the absolute least. The ortho, para-directors produce the most, with the yield increasing as ortho-attack is sterically disfavored (-CH3 < -C2H5) and with the electronically favored para-direction of halogens (-Cl being the highest).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
