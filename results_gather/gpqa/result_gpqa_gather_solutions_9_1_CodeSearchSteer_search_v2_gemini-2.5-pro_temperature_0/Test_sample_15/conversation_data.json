A compound is chiral if its molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The double bond and the atoms directly attached to it (`Cl`, `H`, `C` of methyl, `C` of ethyl) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors (`3aR`, `7aS`, `E`), indicating that it is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   The core structure is a derivative of a norbornane system. The parent molecule without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group (i.e., with a `CH2` bridge) and with the `cis-endo` anhydride fusion is a meso compound, possessing a plane of symmetry.\n    *   However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` is `=CHCl`. Replacing the symmetrical `CH2` bridge with the unsymmetrical `=CHCl` group destroys the plane of symmetry.\n    *   The resulting molecule is chiral. Since the name specifies a single stereoisomer of a chiral compound, it will be optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). The configuration is given as `(2R, 3S)`.\n    *   This specific combination of stereocenters results in a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. In its staggered anti-conformation, this molecule has a center of inversion.\n    *   Meso compounds are optically inactive.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   The configuration is `(2R, 3R)`. This is a diastereomer of the meso form.\n    *   The `(2R, 3R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(2S, 3S)` isomer, are non-superimposable. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The compound named is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: `-OH`, `-H`, `-CH2-CH=` and `-CH=CH-CH2-`. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, so it is chiral.\n    *   The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all-`cis`).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. In its chair conformation with all three -OH groups in axial positions, the molecule has a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (`σv`).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butane chain. It is attached to a `-H`, a `-CH2-` group, and two `-CH3` groups. Since it is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It has accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, each compound must be analyzed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule is an alkene. The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this complex molecule includes specific stereochemical descriptors ((3aR,7aS)). This indicates that a single, specific enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer is by definition chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between these two carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral and its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, is non-superimposable. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. The designation of a specific enantiomer means the compound is chiral and optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This compound, also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has the three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposing CH2 group on the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** This ketone does not possess any chiral centers. The carbon in the chain bonded to two methyl groups (C3) is not chiral, and no other carbon atom has four different substituents. The molecule as a whole is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound step-by-step.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. This molecule has no chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The molecule itself is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer (an enantiomer). A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3. Such a compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair (the other being the (2S,3S) enantiomer). Therefore, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1, which is a chiral center (bonded to H, OH, C2, and C6, which are all different). Since a single enantiomer is specified, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation, but this does not make it achiral. Since it is not superimposable on its mirror image (the all-trans isomer), it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are 4 optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef count_optically_active_compounds():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are\n    optically active based on their structural properties and stereochemical descriptors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a meso compound.\n    # Chiral molecules are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    compounds_analysis = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\",\n            \"is_active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Achiral.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features to check for are chiral centers and elements of symmetry (plane of symmetry, center of inversion). If a molecule has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is achiral and thus optically inactive. Compounds with specific stereochemical descriptors (like R or S) are given as single stereoisomers.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: The molecule has a C=C double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond are sp2 hybridized. The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents) in this molecule. The molecule is planar around the double bond. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex, rigid bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The name itself provides the key information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (`3aR,7aS`) and the geometry of a double bond (`E`). This means the name refers to a single, specific stereoisomer. A molecule with chiral centers is chiral unless it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Given the complex and asymmetric substitution pattern, this molecule lacks any such symmetry elements.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the rest of the molecule). This allows for the possibility of a meso compound. The (R,S) combination for this particular structure is indeed the meso form. It possesses an internal plane of symmetry when viewed in the correct conformation (e.g., in its Fischer projection, there is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the (2R,3S) compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The (2R,3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. Together, they form an enantiomeric pair. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with an alcohol group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that all three groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This highly symmetric molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral (a meso-like compound) and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We check for chiral centers. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. No other carbon atom in the molecule is bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features leading to chirality are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. This molecule has no such carbon atom. The carbons of the C=C double bond are sp2-hybridized and cannot be stereocenters. The other carbons are either part of a methyl group or a methylene group (-CH2-), so they are not stereocenters either.\n    *   The molecule is essentially planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name explicitly defines the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E).\n    *   The designation of a specific configuration (R/S) means that the molecule has stereocenters and is being described as a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer (enantiomer) of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This complex, bicyclic molecule is not a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule has a symmetrical structure, with identical groups (COOH) at both ends and identical substituents (H, CH3) on the two central carbons.\n    *   When a molecule has two stereocenters and a symmetrical structure, the isomer with opposite configurations (R,S or S,R) is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have an internal element of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that makes them achiral, despite the presence of stereocenters. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are a pair of enantiomers. They do not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the (2R,3R) isomer is a chiral molecule. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the ring path `-C2H2-C3H=`, and (4) the ring path `-C6H2-C5H2-`. Since the two paths around the ring are different (one encounters the double bond sooner than the other), C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single stereoisomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring's average plane.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are each bonded to -H, -OH, and two ring segments. Due to the symmetrical substitution, the two paths around the ring from any of these carbons are identical (e.g., from C1, the path `-C2-C3(OH)-C4-` is identical to `-C6-C5(OH)-C4-`). Therefore, C1, C3, and C5 are not stereocenters.\n    *   The molecule has multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group). A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters (carbon with four different groups).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. The `-CH2-` carbon has two identical hydrogens. The `-CH(CH3)2` carbon has two identical methyl groups. No carbon in the isobutyl chain is a stereocenter.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, all carbons are `-CH2-` groups except for the one attached to the carbonyl group. This carbon is attached to the carbonyl, a hydrogen, and two `-CH2-` groups in the ring. The path around the ring is symmetrical. So, no carbon in the ring is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often occurs when a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, creating a chiral center. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity makes the molecule superimposable on its mirror image, so it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors *(3aR,7aS)*, which indicate specific configurations at chiral centers. A compound that is a single, specific enantiomer is by definition chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbon 2 and carbon 3). However, the substituents on both chiral centers are identical (H, CH₃, COOH). The *(2R,3S)* configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such compounds are called meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The *(2R,3R)* configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the *(2S,3S)* isomer. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a `-CH₂-CH=CH-` path around the ring, and a `-CH=CH-CH₂-` path. This makes C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the *(R)* enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule and thus optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has a highly symmetrical structure. The *cis*-isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring, possesses a plane of symmetry. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often caused by the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity gives the molecule a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS). These descriptors specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement at chiral centers. The naming of a specific, non-meso stereoisomer indicates that the compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the substituents on both chiral carbons are identical (a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, and a carboxylic acid group). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. This type of compound is known as a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule and has a non-superimposable mirror image, the (2S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at the first carbon atom (C1), which is a chiral center. The paths around the ring from C1 are different due to the double bond's position. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has its three hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry in the molecule, for instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon of a 3-methylbutanone chain. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule, so it is not chiral. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The entire molecule is planar, meaning it has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes specific stereochemical descriptors ((3aR,7aS,E)). This indicates that a single, specific stereoisomer is being described. Such a molecule is chiral, and as a single enantiomer, it will be optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two stereocenters. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with a center of inversion, which means it is achiral. This specific isomer is known as a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and is therefore a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at the first carbon, which is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to this carbon are -H, -OH, and two different carbon pathways around the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). The designation of a single enantiomer ((R)) means the compound is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom with four different groups attached. The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. No carbon in this molecule is a chiral center. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule lacks a chiral center and is achiral, thus it is not optically active.\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.

A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). However, molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such compounds are called meso compounds. When a compound is named with specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it refers to a single enantiomer, which is optically active by definition.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is an alkene.

For example, a plane passing through any of the C-OH bonds and the opposite CH2 group is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and a `CH2` group, so it is not chiral. No other carbon atom is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the `C=O`, `CH2`, and `CH` groups, bisecting the two methyl groups and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nTo summarize:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond and does not possess any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters using (R) and (S) notations. This indicates that the molecule is a single, specific stereoisomer that is chiral. As a chiral molecule, it will be optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite the presence of chiral centers and thus optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry, and the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image (the (2S, 3S) isomer). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name indicates the (R) configuration at the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups (H, OH, and two different paths around the ring). Since a specific chiral enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this compound, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis). This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** An examination of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. A compound with stereocenters can still be achiral if it is a meso compound, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The carbons of the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The other carbons in the molecule (C3, C4, and the methyl carbon) are bonded to at least two identical hydrogen atoms, so they are not chiral centers either. The molecule lacks any chiral center or other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates the presence of specific stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other half of the molecule) are identical to the substituents on C3. The given stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (R and S), it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. Such a compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **achiral** and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters have the same configuration `(2R,3R)`. This molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Therefore, `(2R,3R)`-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name includes the descriptor `(R)`, indicating a specific stereoisomer. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group (-OH), a `-CH2-CH=` group (C2-C3), and a `-CH2-CH2-CH=` group (C6-C5-C4). Since C1 is a stereocenter and a specific enantiomer `(R)` is given, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is the all-*cis* isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. The designation `(1s,3s,5s)` refers to the absolute configuration of the stereocenters, which could also be named `(1S,3S,5S)`. This molecule possesses a C₃ axis of symmetry but lacks any improper rotation axis (Sₙ) or a plane of symmetry. Molecules belonging to the C₃ point group are chiral. Since a specific enantiomer is designated, it is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. Let's examine the molecule for stereocenters.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen atom, a methyl group (C4), another methyl group (the substituent), and a `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. The four groups are: H, CH₃, CH₃, and -CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. Wait, the parent chain is butan-1-one, and there is a methyl group at position 3. The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to:\n        1.  H\n        2.  CH₃ (the methyl group that is C4)\n        3.  CH₃ (the methyl substituent)\n        4.  -CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl\n    This interpretation is incorrect. The correct interpretation is that C3 is attached to H, C4 (a methyl group), C2, and a methyl substituent. Let's re-examine the structure from the name: The parent chain is butan-1-one, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A methyl group is at C3. So, the carbon skeleton is `C4-C3(CH3)-C2-C1`. The group attached to the carbonyl at C1 is a cyclopentyl ring. The full structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    Let's check C3 for chirality. The four groups attached are:\n    1.  H\n    2.  CH₃ (C4)\n    3.  CH₃ (the methyl substituent)\n    4.  -CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl\n    This is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the structure. The parent chain is butan-1-one. The methyl group is at C3. The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-`. The group attached to the carbonyl is cyclopentyl. So the structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    Let's check C3 again. It is attached to H, a methyl group, another methyl group, and the rest of the chain. This is wrong.\n    The correct structure for 3-methylbutane is isopentane. So, 3-methylbutan-1-one has the structure `(CH3)2CHCH2C(=O)-`. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to two methyl groups and is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive** (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Active**\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive**\n\nThere are four compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound (an achiral compound with chiral centers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis will determine how many of the seven listed compounds are optically active.\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms attached to the double bond lie in the same plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. The presence of these R/S designations indicates that this is a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral compound. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbons 2 and 3). However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, which can be seen when the molecule is in an eclipsed conformation, or a center of inversion in its anti-periplanar conformation. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a -CH=CH-CH2- portion of the ring, and a -CH2-CH2- portion of the ring. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and therefore optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The notation (1s,3s,5s) indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl-bearing carbon and the carbon atom opposite to it in the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this compound is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is in turn bonded to a 3-methylbutyl group. The chemical structure is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. There are no chiral centers in this molecule; the carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule as a whole is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine the number of optically active compounds, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture. The presence of stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or specific isomer names indicates we are considering a single stereoisomer, which will be optically active if the molecule itself is chiral.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. Naming a specific, non-meso stereoisomer indicates that we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion, depending on the conformation). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry.

Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different paths around the ring due to the position of the double bond.

The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers.

The molecule itself is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer (an enantiomer). A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3. Such a compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair (the other being the (2S,3S) enantiomer). Therefore, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1, which is a chiral center (bonded to H, OH, C2, and C6, which are all different). Since a single enantiomer is specified, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation, but this does not make it achiral. Since it is not superimposable on its mirror image (the all-trans isomer), it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are 4 optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef count_optically_active_compounds():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are\n    optically active based on their structural properties and stereochemical descriptors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a meso compound.\n    # Chiral molecules are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    compounds_analysis = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\",\n            \"is_active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Achiral.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features to check for are chiral centers and elements of symmetry (plane of symmetry, center of inversion). If a molecule has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is achiral and thus optically inactive. Compounds with specific stereochemical descriptors (like R or S) are given as single stereoisomers.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: The molecule has a C=C double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond are sp2 hybridized. The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents) in this molecule. The molecule is planar around the double bond. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex, rigid bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The name itself provides the key information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (`3aR,7aS`) and the geometry of a double bond (`E`). This means the name refers to a single, specific stereoisomer. A molecule with chiral centers is chiral unless it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Given the complex and asymmetric substitution pattern, this molecule lacks any such symmetry elements.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the rest of the molecule). This allows for the possibility of a meso compound. The (R,S) combination for this particular structure is indeed the meso form. It possesses an internal plane of symmetry when viewed in the correct conformation (e.g., in its Fischer projection, there is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the (2R,3S) compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The (2R,3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. Together, they form an enantiomeric pair. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with an alcohol group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that all three groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This highly symmetric molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral (a meso-like compound) and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We check for chiral centers. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. No other carbon atom in the molecule is bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features leading to chirality are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. This molecule has no such carbon atom. The carbons of the C=C double bond are sp2-hybridized and cannot be stereocenters. The other carbons are either part of a methyl group or a methylene group (-CH2-), so they are not stereocenters either.\n    *   The molecule is essentially planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name explicitly defines the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E).\n    *   The designation of a specific configuration (R/S) means that the molecule has stereocenters and is being described as a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer (enantiomer) of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This complex, bicyclic molecule is not a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule has a symmetrical structure, with identical groups (COOH) at both ends and identical substituents (H, CH3) on the two central carbons.\n    *   When a molecule has two stereocenters and a symmetrical structure, the isomer with opposite configurations (R,S or S,R) is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have an internal element of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that makes them achiral, despite the presence of stereocenters. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are a pair of enantiomers. They do not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the (2R,3R) isomer is a chiral molecule. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the ring path `-C2H2-C3H=`, and (4) the ring path `-C6H2-C5H2-`. Since the two paths around the ring are different (one encounters the double bond sooner than the other), C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single stereoisomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring's average plane.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are each bonded to -H, -OH, and two ring segments. Due to the symmetrical substitution, the two paths around the ring from any of these carbons are identical (e.g., from C1, the path `-C2-C3(OH)-C4-` is identical to `-C6-C5(OH)-C4-`). Therefore, C1, C3, and C5 are not stereocenters.\n    *   The molecule has multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group). A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters (carbon with four different groups).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. The `-CH2-` carbon has two identical hydrogens. The `-CH(CH3)2` carbon has two identical methyl groups. No carbon in the isobutyl chain is a stereocenter.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, all carbons are `-CH2-` groups except for the one attached to the carbonyl group. This carbon is attached to the carbonyl, a hydrogen, and two `-CH2-` groups in the ring. The path around the ring is symmetrical. So, no carbon in the ring is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often occurs when a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, creating a chiral center. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity makes the molecule superimposable on its mirror image, so it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors *(3aR,7aS)*, which indicate specific configurations at chiral centers. A compound that is a single, specific enantiomer is by definition chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbon 2 and carbon 3). However, the substituents on both chiral centers are identical (H, CH₃, COOH). The *(2R,3S)* configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such compounds are called meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The *(2R,3R)* configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the *(2S,3S)* isomer. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a `-CH₂-CH=CH-` path around the ring, and a `-CH=CH-CH₂-` path. This makes C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the *(R)* enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule and thus optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has a highly symmetrical structure. The *cis*-isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring, possesses a plane of symmetry. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often caused by the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity gives the molecule a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS). These descriptors specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement at chiral centers. The naming of a specific, non-meso stereoisomer indicates that the compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the substituents on both chiral carbons are identical (a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, and a carboxylic acid group). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. This type of compound is known as a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule and has a non-superimposable mirror image, the (2S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at the first carbon atom (C1), which is a chiral center. The paths around the ring from C1 are different due to the double bond's position. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has its three hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry in the molecule, for instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon of a 3-methylbutanone chain. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule, so it is not chiral. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The entire molecule is planar, meaning it has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes specific stereochemical descriptors ((3aR,7aS,E)). This indicates that a single, specific stereoisomer is being described. Such a molecule is chiral, and as a single enantiomer, it will be optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two stereocenters. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with a center of inversion, which means it is achiral. This specific isomer is known as a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and is therefore a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at the first carbon, which is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to this carbon are -H, -OH, and two different carbon pathways around the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). The designation of a single enantiomer ((R)) means the compound is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom with four different groups attached. The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. No carbon in this molecule is a chiral center. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule lacks a chiral center and is achiral, thus it is not optically active.\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral and are not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). However, molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such compounds are called meso compounds. When a compound is named with specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it refers to a single enantiomer, which is optically active by definition.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   It has no chiral centers.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule.

It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric, with identical groups (COOH) at both ends.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (2R, 3S), meaning the two chiral centers have opposite configurations.\n    *   In a molecule with two chiral centers and identical ends, the (R,S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   This makes the compound a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is a meso compound and is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.

It is attached to four different groups: -OH, -H, a `-CH=CH-` path in the ring, and a `-CH2-CH2-` path in the ring.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration for this chiral center.\n    *   This means we are considering a single enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is a single enantiomer and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.

It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) perpendicular to the average plane of the ring. It also has three vertical planes of symmetry (σv), each passing through a C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, even though carbons 1, 3, and 5 are stereocenters. This is another example of a meso-like achiral compound.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's search for any chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   There are no such carbon atoms in this molecule. The `CH` in the isobutyl group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All other sp3 carbons are CH2 groups or are part of the symmetrical cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The molecule is achiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry in a certain conformation.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and is present as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be achiral are the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule has a double bond. The atoms connected by the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E). These descriptors specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of R and S descriptors indicates the presence of chiral centers, and the molecule as a whole is chiral. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is not a racemic mixture. A pure sample of a single enantiomer of a chiral compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule that has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Such compounds with chiral centers that are overall achiral are called meso compounds. Meso compounds are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a different stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The (2R, 3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable. As a specific, single enantiomer, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom C1, which is attached to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (ring path), and -CH2-CH2- (ring path). The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the stereoisomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis configuration). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Let's examine the structure for any chiral centers. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and not chiral.\n    *   The CH2 carbon is not chiral.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen atom, a -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl group, and two identical methyl (-CH3) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically active:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically inactive:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key features to look for are stereocenters (typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. When a compound's name includes a specific stereochemical descriptor like (R) or (S), it refers to a single enantiomer, which is optically active unless it is a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis**: This is an alkene.

This specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. Naming a specific, non-meso stereoisomer this way indicates that we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer is chiral by definition.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` combination of stereocenters in this symmetrical molecule results in an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters.

The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal symmetry. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. The name refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon atom at position 1, bonded to the -OH group, is a stereocenter because the two paths around the ring from this carbon are different (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, indicating a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring.

This property typically arises from the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond and does not possess any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters using (R) and (S) notations. This indicates that the molecule is a single, specific stereoisomer that is chiral. As a chiral molecule, it will be optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite the presence of chiral centers and thus optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry, and the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image (the (2S, 3S) isomer). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name indicates the (R) configuration at the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups (H, OH, and two different paths around the ring). Since a specific chiral enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this compound, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis). This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** An examination of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. A compound with stereocenters can still be achiral if it is a meso compound, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The carbons of the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The other carbons in the molecule (C3, C4, and the methyl carbon) are bonded to at least two identical hydrogen atoms, so they are not chiral centers either. The molecule lacks any chiral center or other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates the presence of specific stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other half of the molecule) are identical to the substituents on C3. The given stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (R and S), it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. Such a compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **achiral** and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters have the same configuration `(2R,3R)`. This molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Therefore, `(2R,3R)`-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name includes the descriptor `(R)`, indicating a specific stereoisomer. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group (-OH), a `-CH2-CH=` group (C2-C3), and a `-CH2-CH2-CH=` group (C6-C5-C4). Since C1 is a stereocenter and a specific enantiomer `(R)` is given, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is the all-*cis* isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. The designation `(1s,3s,5s)` refers to the absolute configuration of the stereocenters, which could also be named `(1S,3S,5S)`. This molecule possesses a C₃ axis of symmetry but lacks any improper rotation axis (Sₙ) or a plane of symmetry. Molecules belonging to the C₃ point group are chiral. Since a specific enantiomer is designated, it is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. Let's examine the molecule for stereocenters.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen atom, a methyl group (C4), another methyl group (the substituent), and a `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. The four groups are: H, CH₃, CH₃, and -CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. Wait, the parent chain is butan-1-one, and there is a methyl group at position 3. The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to:\n        1.  H\n        2.  CH₃ (the methyl group that is C4)\n        3.  CH₃ (the methyl substituent)\n        4.  -CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl\n    This interpretation is incorrect. The correct interpretation is that C3 is attached to H, C4 (a methyl group), C2, and a methyl substituent. Let's re-examine the structure from the name: The parent chain is butan-1-one, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A methyl group is at C3. So, the carbon skeleton is `C4-C3(CH3)-C2-C1`. The group attached to the carbonyl at C1 is a cyclopentyl ring. The full structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    Let's check C3 for chirality. The four groups attached are:\n    1.  H\n    2.  CH₃ (C4)\n    3.  CH₃ (the methyl substituent)\n    4.  -CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl\n    This is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the structure. The parent chain is butan-1-one. The methyl group is at C3. The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-`. The group attached to the carbonyl is cyclopentyl. So the structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    Let's check C3 again. It is attached to H, a methyl group, another methyl group, and the rest of the chain. This is wrong.\n    The correct structure for 3-methylbutane is isopentane. So, 3-methylbutan-1-one has the structure `(CH3)2CHCH2C(=O)-`. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to two methyl groups and is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive** (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Active**\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive**\n\nThere are four compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound (an achiral compound with chiral centers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis will determine how many of the seven listed compounds are optically active.\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms attached to the double bond lie in the same plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. The presence of these R/S designations indicates that this is a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral compound. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbons 2 and 3). However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, which can be seen when the molecule is in an eclipsed conformation, or a center of inversion in its anti-periplanar conformation. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a -CH=CH-CH2- portion of the ring, and a -CH2-CH2- portion of the ring. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and therefore optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The notation (1s,3s,5s) indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl-bearing carbon and the carbon atom opposite to it in the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this compound is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is in turn bonded to a 3-methylbutyl group. The chemical structure is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. There are no chiral centers in this molecule; the carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule as a whole is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
