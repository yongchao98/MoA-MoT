Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the given options.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core formula for this part of the molecule is C₆H₄.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows vinyl-H signals:** The presence of two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) indicates a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion on Unsaturation:** The molecule contains an aromatic ring (4 degrees of unsaturation), a C=O double bond (1 degree of unsaturation), and a C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation). The total required Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation for Each Option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (Possible)\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. (Possible)\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect)\n    This calculation narrows the possibilities down to C₁₂H₁₄O₂ and C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Fragments:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring (C₆H₄):** This fragment has 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl Group (-CH=CH-CH₃):** The specific splitting pattern of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is a classic signature for a propenyl group. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. It has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **Second Methyl Group:** There is a second -CH₃ signal.\n    *   **Ester Group (-COO-):** This contains one carbon and two oxygens.\n    *   **Crucial Constraint (No –CH₂ groups):** This eliminates many possibilities. The second methyl group must be part of the ester, forming a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃) to avoid creating a -CH₂- group.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments that fit all the constraints:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 1 (from the ester's C=O) + 1 (from the ester's -CH₃) = **11 Carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's -CH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**.\n\n    The molecular formula derived from the spectroscopic evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    The deduced formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option C. The other possible formula from the DoU calculation, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option B), contains an extra CH₂ unit compared to the deduced structure. The presence of a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data, making this option incorrect. Therefore, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the only formula that fits all the evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the given options.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data to Identify Fragments\n\nFirst, we break down the provided spectroscopic information into molecular fragments:\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the options.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the four protons on the C₆H₄ ring. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as 1,4- (para) substitution.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **-C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The other methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out any fragments containing a methylene group, such as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃) to satisfy this condition.\n\n### 2. Assembling the Fragments and Determining the Formula\n\nNow, we combine the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and calculate its formula.\n\n*   Aromatic ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   Propenyl group: **-C₃H₅**\n*   Ester group with a methyl group (e.g., a methyl ester, -COOCH₃): This fragment contributes **-C₂H₃O₂** (one carbon from the carbonyl, one from the methyl group; three hydrogens from the methyl group; two oxygens).\n\nSumming these fragments gives the total molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\nThe chemical formula derived from all the spectral evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) can confirm our finding.\n*   **DoU from structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DoU) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DoU) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the options:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6\n\nThe DoU calculation eliminates options B and C, leaving A and D.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe must now choose between C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (A) and C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (D). Our structural analysis based on the specific NMR fragments yielded the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ contains an additional CH₂ group compared to our derived structure. The presence of a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data, which states, \"**There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n\nTherefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, having the formula C₆H₄.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It rules out any structures containing methylene groups, such as ethyl esters (-COOCH₂CH₃) or propyl groups (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** This means there are two chemically distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n    *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   The other vinyl proton is only coupled to the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule must contain the following pieces:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (formula C₃H₅). This fragment accounts for the two vinyl signals and one of the -CH₃ signals.\n*   **Ester Group with a Methyl Group:** We have an ester (-COO-) and a second -CH₃ group. Due to the \"no -CH₂-\" rule, this must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the complete molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **From Structure:** The structure contains an aromatic ring (4 DoU), a C=C double bond (1 DoU), and a C=O double bond (1 DoU). The total required DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n*   **From Formula:** Let's check the DoU for the options. The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n\nThis eliminates options B and D. We must distinguish between A and C.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nOur derived formula from the fragments is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This matches option C. Option A, C₁₂H₁₄O₂, has the correct DoU but contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived structure. The presence of this CH₂ group is explicitly contradicted by the NMR data (\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"). Therefore, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the only formula that fits all the evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a core formula of C₆H₄. This structure contributes 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU) - one for the ring and three for the double bonds.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O double bond adds 1 DoU.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows vinyl-H signals:** This confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which adds another 1 DoU.\n    *   **Total Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The total required DoU is 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for Each Option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect)\n    This narrows the possibilities down to A (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂).\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Fragments to Distinguish Between A and B:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** Confirms the C₆H₄ fragment (4 hydrogens).\n    *   **Vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a signature for a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH₃`. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is C₃H₅ (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens).\n    *   **-CH₃ Groups (2 signals):** One methyl group is from the propenyl fragment. The other must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No -CH₂ Groups:** This is the most critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) or have any other methylene groups. Therefore, the second methyl group must be part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH₃`).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified pieces:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester group with a methyl: This adds a `-COO-` and a `-CH₃`. Let's count the atoms not already included: 1 carbonyl carbon (C), 1 methyl carbon (C), 3 methyl hydrogens (H₃), and 2 oxygens (O₂). So, this part adds C₂H₃O₂.\n\n    Now, let's sum everything:\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from OCH₃) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from OCH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option A. Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) has the correct DoU but contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the derived structure. The explicit absence of -CH₂ signals in the NMR spectrum rules out option B. Therefore, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a core formula of C₆H₄. This structure contributes 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE: 1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O double bond adds 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows vinyl-H signals:** This indicates the presence of a C=C double bond, which adds another 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **Total Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE):** The total required DBE is 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DBE for Each Option:**\n    The formula for DBE is `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.

The formula for this fragment is C₃H₅.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** We have an ester group and a second -CH₃ signal. The problem states there are **no signals for –CH₂ groups**. This is a critical constraint. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) is ruled out. Therefore, the second methyl group must be part of a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes C₂H₃O₂.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester/Methyl Group: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    *   **Total Carbons:** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens:** 2 (from ester)\n\n    The molecular formula derived from a structure that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option A. Let's reconsider option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). This formula has an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived formula. The presence of a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data (\"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\").

The two signals suggest a symmetrical substitution pattern (like para). This fragment is C₆H₄.\n    *   **Vinyl Group & one -CH₃ (C₃H₅):** The splitting pattern of a \"doublet\" and a \"doublet of quartets\" is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.

The splitting pattern of one signal being a doublet (d) and the other being a doublet of quartets (dq) is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this substituent is **-C₃H₅**.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Methyl Protons:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester functionality.\n    *   **¹H NMR - No -CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other methylene (-CH₂-) linkers. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**).\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments to build the complete molecule.\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: -C₃H₅\n    *   Ester group with methyl: This fragment contributes a carbonyl carbon (-C=O), two oxygens, and a methyl group (-CH₃).

It eliminates any structures that contain a methylene group, such as an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.\n    *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This propenyl group fragment has the formula **-C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Molecular Fragments\n\nWe can now piece together the molecule from the identified fragments:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n2.  **Substituent 1 (Propenyl Group):** -C₃H₅\n3.  **Substituent 2 (Ester Group):** The ester group must contain the second methyl group. Given the \"no -CH₂-\" rule, the simplest and most plausible structure for this part is a methyl ester group, **-COOCH₃**. This fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Chemical Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) and Compare with Options\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** The deduced structure contains an aromatic ring (DoU=4), a C=C double bond (DoU=1), and a C=O double bond (DoU=1). The total required DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n*   **DoU from Formula:** The DoU for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is `C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`. The DoU matches perfectly.\n*   **Comparison with Options:**\n    *   **A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** This matches our derived formula.\n    *   **B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** Incorrect carbon count.\n    *   **C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** Incorrect carbon and hydrogen count. This formula also has an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived structure, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   **D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** Incorrect hydrogen count. This formula would likely correspond to a structure where the propenyl group is saturated to a propyl group, which would introduce -CH₂- signals and eliminate the vinyl signals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe systematic analysis of all provided spectroscopic data points unequivocally to the chemical formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. All other options are inconsistent with one or more of the key constraints.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Functional Groups and Structural Features\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a core formula of **C₆H₄**. This structure has 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 ring + 3 double bonds).\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group. The C=O double bond adds 1 degree of unsaturation. This also accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n*   **¹H NMR shows vinyl-H signals:** The presence of two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) indicates a carbon-carbon double bond, which adds another 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Total Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** The total required DoU is the sum from the aromatic ring (4), the ester's carbonyl group (1), and the vinyl group (1), which equals **6**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of DoU for Each Option\n\nWe can now check which of the proposed formulas has a DoU of 6 using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (This is a possible answer).\n*   **B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (This is incorrect).\n*   **C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. (This is a possible answer).\n*   **D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (This is incorrect).\n\nThis initial analysis narrows the choices down to A (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂).\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of ¹H NMR Fragments\n\nTo distinguish between the remaining options, we must assemble the molecule from the fragments identified in the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A C₆H₄ fragment.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The splitting pattern of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** There are two distinct -CH₃ signals. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must belong to the ester.\n*   **No -CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester to contain the second methyl group without introducing a -CH₂- group, it must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**). An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) is ruled out. The -COOCH₃ fragment has the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Final Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula:\n\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (methyl ester group)\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen atoms:** **2**\n\nThe chemical formula derived from all the spectroscopic evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option A. Option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is incorrect because it contains an additional CH₂ unit compared to the derived structure. The presence of a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data, which states there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"\n\nTherefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided information is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided information.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, giving a core formula of C₆H₄.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows no signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint that eliminates any structures containing a methylene (-CH₂-) group, such as an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Signals to Identify Fragments:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the four protons on the C₆H₄ ring. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, like 1,4- (para) substitution.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The other methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no -CH₂- groups, this must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes C₂H₃O₂ to the formula.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall formula:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n    *   **Ester with Methyl Group:** C₂H₃O₂ (This accounts for the C=O, the two oxygens, and the second methyl group).\n    *   **Total Carbons:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens:** **2**\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    A good way to double-check is to calculate the DoU.\n    *   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (DoU=4) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (DoU=1) + 1 ester C=O bond (DoU=1) = **Total DoU of 6**.\n    *   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    The DoU matches, confirming the formula is plausible.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 5. Incorrect. Also, this would likely require a -CH₂- group (e.g., by saturating the propenyl group), which is ruled out.\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 7. Incorrect.\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 6. While the DoU is correct, this formula contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the deduced structure, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 6. This formula perfectly matches the structure deduced from all the spectral data.\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided information is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information\nThe core of the problem is to translate the provided spectral data into structural fragments of the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This identifies a benzene ring with two substituents, giving a core fragment of **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the four protons on the C₆H₄ fragment. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical arrangement, such as para (1,4) substitution.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must belong to the ester functionality.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical negative constraint. It rules out common fragments like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) or propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃) to avoid having a -CH₂- group.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\nBy combining the identified fragments, we can calculate the total molecular formula.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Fragment:** C₆H₄\n2.  **Propenyl Group Fragment:** C₃H₅\n3.  **Ester + Methyl Fragment:** The ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH₃) combine to form a fragment like methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃). This fragment's formula is **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nA good way to cross-check the result is to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation.\n\n*   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\nThe DoU values match, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\nThe deduced formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched with the provided choices.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2: Incorrect hydrogen count and DoU (5). The extra two hydrogens would require removing a double bond, contradicting the vinyl-H signals.\n*   B) C12H14O2: Incorrect carbon and hydrogen count. This formula contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the deduced structure, which is explicitly ruled out by the \"no –CH₂ signals\" constraint.\n*   **C) C11H12O2:** This perfectly matches the formula derived from all the spectroscopic evidence.\n*   D) C12H12O2: Incorrect carbon count and DoU (7).\n\nThe analysis consistently and unambiguously leads to the chemical formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1.

The splitting pattern, one doublet (d) and one doublet of quartets (dq), is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this substituent is **-C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Methyl Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must belong to the ester group.\n*   **¹H NMR - No -CH₂ Groups:** This is a critical piece of information. For the ester group to contain a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, it must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate (**-OCOCH₃**). An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) is ruled out.

This is explicitly contradicted by the \"no –CH₂ groups\" rule.\n    *   B) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6. This formula perfectly matches the one derived from a detailed analysis of all the spectral data.\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 5. Incorrect DoU. This formula lacks a double bond or ring that is required by the data.\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 7. Incorrect DoU. This formula has an extra double bond or ring not supported by the data.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, only C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information\nThe first step is to translate the raw spectral data into structural fragments of the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the formula options.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It eliminates any possibility of having an ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), or similar alkyl chain in the molecule.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a highly specific and informative splitting pattern. It is the classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.\n    *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the two methyl groups. Its formula is **-C₃H₅**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\nNow, we combine the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and find its formula.\n\n1.  We have the aromatic ring: **C₆H₄**\n2.  We have the propenyl group: **-C₃H₅**\n3.  We have an ester group (-COO-) and a second methyl group (-CH₃). The \"no -CH₂-\" rule dictates that this second methyl group must be part of the ester, forming a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**. This fragment contributes **-C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\nLet's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe chemical formula deduced from all the spectral evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) and Evaluate Options\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from structure:** 1 (ring) + 3 (ring double bonds) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from formulas:**\n    *   **A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. This matches.\n    *   **B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. This does not match. It lacks a double bond.\n    *   **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This does not match. It has an extra ring or double bond.\n    *   **D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. The DoU matches, but this formula has an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived formula. The presence of a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided information—the aromatic ring, the ester, the specific propenyl group splitting pattern, and the crucial absence of any -CH₂- signals—is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Structural Information and Calculate the Required Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe problem provides several key structural features derived from spectroscopic data. We can use these to determine the required number of rings and/or pi bonds (Degree of Unsaturation, or DoU) for the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** An aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, contributing 4 to the DoU.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester group (-COO-) contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, which contributes 1 to the DoU.\n*   **¹H NMR shows vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) indicates a carbon-carbon double bond, which contributes another 1 to the DoU.\n\nBy summing these contributions, we find the total required DoU for the molecule:\nTotal Required DoU = 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the DoU for Each Formula Option\n\nNext, we calculate the DoU for each of the given chemical formulas using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. This allows us to eliminate any options that do not have a DoU of 6.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    # Find C and H counts\n    c_match = re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    h_match = re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    \n    C = int(c_match.group(1)) if c_match else 0\n    H = int(h_match.group(1)) if h_match else 0\n    \n    # DoU formula: C + 1 - H/2\n    dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n    return dou\n\n# The options as provided in the question\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C12H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C12H14O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C11H14O2\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each option:\")\nfor option, formula in options.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}): DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nRequired DoU based on spectral data is 6.\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n<<<\n- **Code Execution**:\n```bash\npython <<EOF\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    # Find C and H counts\n    c_match = re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    h_match = re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    \n    C = int(c_match.group(1)) if c_match else 0\n    H = int(h_match.group(1)) if h_match else 0\n    \n    # DoU formula: C + 1 - H/2\n    dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n    return dou\n\n# The options as provided in the question\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C12H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C12H14O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C11H14O2\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each option:\")\nfor option, formula in options.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}): DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nRequired DoU based on spectral data is 6.\")\nEOF\n```\n- **Code Output**:\n```text\nDegree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each option:\nOption A (C11H12O2): DoU = 6\nOption B (C12H12O2): DoU = 7\nOption C (C12H14O2): DoU = 6\nOption D (C11H14O2): DoU = 5\n\nRequired DoU based on spectral data is 6.\n```\n>>>\nThe DoU calculation confirms that only options **A (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)** are possible, as they both have the required DoU of 6. Options B and D are eliminated.\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Molecular Structure from ¹H NMR Fragments\n\nTo distinguish between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂, we must use the detailed information from the ¹H NMR spectrum to assemble the molecule's fragments.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring gives a **C₆H₄** fragment.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The specific splitting pattern of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl signals and one of the methyl signals. Its formula is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** We have an ester group (-COO-) and a second -CH₃ signal. The problem states there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**. This is a critical constraint. For the ester to contain the second methyl group without introducing a -CH₂- group, it must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**). This fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Formula and Make a Decision\n\nBy summing the atoms from the fragments that are required by the NMR data, we can determine the correct molecular formula:\n\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (methyl ester)\n*   **Total Carbons:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens:** **2**\n\nThe only structure that fits all the spectroscopic details has the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis result matches **Option A**. Option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) has the correct DoU but contains an extra CH₂ unit compared to the structure we deduced. The presence of this CH₂ unit is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data (\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"). Therefore, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ is incorrect.\n\nThe final answer is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The analysis provided is correct and the code execution confirms the initial step of the reasoning. Here is a summary of the logical steps leading to the final answer:\n\n1.  **Determine Required Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The structural features described (aromatic ring, ester, vinyl group) require a total DoU of 6.\n    *   Aromatic ring = 4 DoU\n    *   Ester (C=O) = 1 DoU\n    *   Vinyl (C=C) = 1 DoU\n    *   Total = 6 DoU\n\n2.  **Filter Options by DoU:** The code output correctly calculated the DoU for each option, confirming that only C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (DoU = 6) and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DoU = 6) are possible candidates. The other two options are eliminated.\n\n3.  **Assemble Molecular Fragments from NMR Data:** The detailed ¹H NMR data allows for the construction of the molecule's skeleton.\n    *   **C₆H₄** from the di-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   **C₃H₅** from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), identified by its unique splitting pattern.\n    *   **C₂H₃O₂** from the methyl ester group (-COOCH₃), which is required to account for the second methyl group and the ester functionality without introducing any -CH₂- groups (as per the \"no –CH₂ signals\" constraint).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Formula:** Summing these fragments gives the complete molecular formula:\n    *   C: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   H: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   O: 2\n    *   The resulting formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:** This derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option A. The other possibility from the DoU calculation, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option D), is incorrect because it contains an extra CH₂ unit compared to the derived structure. The presence of a CH₂ group is explicitly contradicted by the NMR data. Therefore, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the only formula that fits all the evidence.\n\n<<<A>>>"

(Possible)\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect)\n    This calculation narrows the possibilities down to C₁₂H₁₄O₂ and C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Fragments:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring (C₆H₄):** This fragment has 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl Group (-CH=CH-CH₃):** The specific splitting pattern of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is a classic signature for a propenyl group.

Therefore, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the only formula that fits all the evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the given options.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data to Identify Fragments\n\nFirst, we break down the provided spectroscopic information into molecular fragments:\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the options.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the four protons on the C₆H₄ ring. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as 1,4- (para) substitution.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **-C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The other methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out any fragments containing a methylene group, such as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃) to satisfy this condition.\n\n### 2. Assembling the Fragments and Determining the Formula\n\nNow, we combine the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and calculate its formula.\n\n*   Aromatic ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   Propenyl group: **-C₃H₅**\n*   Ester group with a methyl group (e.g., a methyl ester, -COOCH₃): This fragment contributes **-C₂H₃O₂** (one carbon from the carbonyl, one from the methyl group; three hydrogens from the methyl group; two oxygens).\n\nSumming these fragments gives the total molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\nThe chemical formula derived from all the spectral evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) can confirm our finding.\n*   **DoU from structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DoU) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DoU) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the options:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6\n\nThe DoU calculation eliminates options B and C, leaving A and D.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe must now choose between C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (A) and C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (D). Our structural analysis based on the specific NMR fragments yielded the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ contains an additional CH₂ group compared to our derived structure. The presence of a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data, which states, \"**There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n\nTherefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, having the formula C₆H₄.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It rules out any structures containing methylene groups, such as ethyl esters (-COOCH₂CH₃) or propyl groups (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** This means there are two chemically distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n    *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   The other vinyl proton is only coupled to the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule must contain the following pieces:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (formula C₃H₅). This fragment accounts for the two vinyl signals and one of the -CH₃ signals.\n*   **Ester Group with a Methyl Group:** We have an ester (-COO-) and a second -CH₃ group. Due to the \"no -CH₂-\" rule, this must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the complete molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **From Structure:** The structure contains an aromatic ring (4 DoU), a C=C double bond (1 DoU), and a C=O double bond (1 DoU). The total required DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n*   **From Formula:** Let's check the DoU for the options. The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n\nThis eliminates options B and D. We must distinguish between A and C.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nOur derived formula from the fragments is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This matches option C. Option A, C₁₂H₁₄O₂, has the correct DoU but contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived structure. The presence of this CH₂ group is explicitly contradicted by the NMR data (\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"). Therefore, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the only formula that fits all the evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a core formula of C₆H₄. This structure contributes 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU) - one for the ring and three for the double bonds.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O double bond adds 1 DoU.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows vinyl-H signals:** This confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which adds another 1 DoU.\n    *   **Total Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The total required DoU is 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for Each Option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect)\n    This narrows the possibilities down to A (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂).\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Fragments to Distinguish Between A and B:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** Confirms the C₆H₄ fragment (4 hydrogens).\n    *   **Vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a signature for a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH₃`. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is C₃H₅ (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens).\n    *   **-CH₃ Groups (2 signals):** One methyl group is from the propenyl fragment. The other must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No -CH₂ Groups:** This is the most critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) or have any other methylene groups. Therefore, the second methyl group must be part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH₃`).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified pieces:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester group with a methyl: This adds a `-COO-` and a `-CH₃`. Let's count the atoms not already included: 1 carbonyl carbon (C), 1 methyl carbon (C), 3 methyl hydrogens (H₃), and 2 oxygens (O₂). So, this part adds C₂H₃O₂.\n\n    Now, let's sum everything:\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from OCH₃) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from OCH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option A. Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) has the correct DoU but contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the derived structure. The explicit absence of -CH₂ signals in the NMR spectrum rules out option B.

This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is C₃H₅.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** We have an ester group and a second -CH₃ signal. The problem states there are **no signals for –CH₂ groups**. This is a critical constraint. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) is ruled out. Therefore, the second methyl group must be part of a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes C₂H₃O₂.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester/Methyl Group: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    *   **Total Carbons:** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens:** 2 (from ester)\n\n    The molecular formula derived from a structure that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option A. Let's reconsider option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). This formula has an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived formula. The presence of a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data (\"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\").

(Incorrect)\n    *   D) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect)\n    This initial analysis eliminates options C and D, leaving A (C12H14O2) and B (C11H12O2) as possibilities.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Fragments to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring (C₆H₄):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The two signals suggest a symmetrical substitution pattern (like para). This fragment is C₆H₄.\n    *   **Vinyl Group & one -CH₃ (C₃H₅):** The splitting pattern of a \"doublet\" and a \"doublet of quartets\" is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. Its formula is C₃H₅.\n    *   **Second -CH₃ and Ester:** There is a second -CH₃ signal.

The core of this fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). The splitting pattern of one signal being a doublet (d) and the other being a doublet of quartets (dq) is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this substituent is **-C₃H₅**.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Methyl Protons:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester functionality.\n    *   **¹H NMR - No -CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other methylene (-CH₂-) linkers. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**).\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments to build the complete molecule.\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: -C₃H₅\n    *   Ester group with methyl: This fragment contributes a carbonyl carbon (-C=O), two oxygens, and a methyl group (-CH₃). The total contribution is **-C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n    Now, add them all together:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester/methyl part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The structure must have: 1 ring (DoU=1), 3 double bonds in the ring (DoU=3), 1 C=O in the ester (DoU=1), and 1 C=C in the propenyl group (DoU=1). Total DoU = 1+3+1+1 = **6**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   The DoU matches, confirming the formula is consistent with the structure.\n\n4.  **Match with the Given Options:**\n    The derived formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.

The formula for this core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It eliminates any structures that contain a methylene group, such as an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.\n    *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This propenyl group fragment has the formula **-C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Molecular Fragments\n\nWe can now piece together the molecule from the identified fragments:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n2.  **Substituent 1 (Propenyl Group):** -C₃H₅\n3.  **Substituent 2 (Ester Group):** The ester group must contain the second methyl group. Given the \"no -CH₂-\" rule, the simplest and most plausible structure for this part is a methyl ester group, **-COOCH₃**. This fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Chemical Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) and Compare with Options\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** The deduced structure contains an aromatic ring (DoU=4), a C=C double bond (DoU=1), and a C=O double bond (DoU=1). The total required DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n*   **DoU from Formula:** The DoU for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is `C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.

This formula also has an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived structure, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   **D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** Incorrect hydrogen count. This formula would likely correspond to a structure where the propenyl group is saturated to a propyl group, which would introduce -CH₂- signals and eliminate the vinyl signals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe systematic analysis of all provided spectroscopic data points unequivocally to the chemical formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. All other options are inconsistent with one or more of the key constraints.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Functional Groups and Structural Features\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a core formula of **C₆H₄**. This structure has 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 ring + 3 double bonds).\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group. The C=O double bond adds 1 degree of unsaturation. This also accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n*   **¹H NMR shows vinyl-H signals:** The presence of two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) indicates a carbon-carbon double bond, which adds another 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Total Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** The total required DoU is the sum from the aromatic ring (4), the ester's carbonyl group (1), and the vinyl group (1), which equals **6**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of DoU for Each Option\n\nWe can now check which of the proposed formulas has a DoU of 6 using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.

Detailed Analysis of ¹H NMR Fragments\n\nTo distinguish between the remaining options, we must assemble the molecule from the fragments identified in the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A C₆H₄ fragment.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The splitting pattern of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** There are two distinct -CH₃ signals. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must belong to the ester.\n*   **No -CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester to contain the second methyl group without introducing a -CH₂- group, it must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**). An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) is ruled out. The -COOCH₃ fragment has the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### 4.

The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, like 1,4- (para) substitution.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The other methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no -CH₂- groups, this must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes C₂H₃O₂ to the formula.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall formula:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n    *   **Ester with Methyl Group:** C₂H₃O₂ (This accounts for the C=O, the two oxygens, and the second methyl group).\n    *   **Total Carbons:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens:** **2**\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    A good way to double-check is to calculate the DoU.\n    *   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (DoU=4) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (DoU=1) + 1 ester C=O bond (DoU=1) = **Total DoU of 6**.\n    *   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    The DoU matches, confirming the formula is plausible.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 5.

While the DoU is correct, this formula contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the deduced structure, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 6. This formula perfectly matches the structure deduced from all the spectral data.\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided information is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information\nThe core of the problem is to translate the provided spectral data into structural fragments of the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This identifies a benzene ring with two substituents, giving a core fragment of **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the four protons on the C₆H₄ fragment. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical arrangement, such as para (1,4) substitution.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must belong to the ester functionality.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical negative constraint. It rules out common fragments like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) or propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃) to avoid having a -CH₂- group.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\nBy combining the identified fragments, we can calculate the total molecular formula.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Fragment:** C₆H₄\n2.  **Propenyl Group Fragment:** C₃H₅\n3.  **Ester + Methyl Fragment:** The ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH₃) combine to form a fragment like methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃). This fragment's formula is **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nA good way to cross-check the result is to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation.\n\n*   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\nThe DoU values match, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\nThe deduced formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched with the provided choices.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2: Incorrect hydrogen count and DoU (5). The extra two hydrogens would require removing a double bond, contradicting the vinyl-H signals.\n*   B) C12H14O2: Incorrect carbon and hydrogen count. This formula contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the deduced structure, which is explicitly ruled out by the \"no –CH₂ signals\" constraint.\n*   **C) C11H12O2:** This perfectly matches the formula derived from all the spectroscopic evidence.\n*   D) C12H12O2: Incorrect carbon count and DoU (7).\n\nThe analysis consistently and unambiguously leads to the chemical formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1. Analyze the Structural Information from the Spectra**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents. The formula for this core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms.\n*   **¹H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). The splitting pattern, one doublet (d) and one doublet of quartets (dq), is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this substituent is **-C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Methyl Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must belong to the ester group.\n*   **¹H NMR - No -CH₂ Groups:** This is a critical piece of information. For the ester group to contain a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, it must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate (**-OCOCH₃**). An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) is ruled out. The fragment containing the ester and the second methyl group has the formula **-C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n*   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester + Methyl Group):** C₂H₃O₂\n\nLet's add them up:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DoU) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\n*   The DoU matches, confirming the structural analysis.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence (including the required DoU of 6 and the absence of -CH₂- groups) is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. We must select the option corresponding to this formula.\n\n*   A) C12H14O2: Has a DoU of 6, but contains an extra CH₂ unit compared to the derived structure, which is ruled out by the NMR data.\n*   B) C11H14O2: Has a DoU of 5, which is inconsistent with the structure.\n*   C) C12H12O2: Has a DoU of 7, which is inconsistent with the structure.\n*   D) C11H12O2: This formula perfectly matches our deduction.\n\nThe analysis consistently points to C₁₁H₁₂O₂ as the only possible formula.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided information.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, which has the formula C₆H₄. An aromatic ring has a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O double bond in the ester adds 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows vinyl-H:** The presence of vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) indicates a C=C double bond, which adds another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total Degree of Unsaturation:** The required DoU for the molecule is 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for Each Option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Does not match)\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Does not match)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. (Matches)\n\n    This initial analysis eliminates options B and C, leaving A (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and D (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) as possibilities.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Fragments:**\n    The detailed NMR data allows us to build the structure piece by piece.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A C₆H₄ fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl and Methyl Groups:** The pattern of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" for the two vinyl protons is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl signals and one of the two -CH₃ signals. This fragment's formula is C₃H₅.\n    *   **Second Methyl Group and Ester:** The second -CH₃ signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **\"No –CH₂ groups\" Constraint:** This is the most critical piece of information to distinguish between the remaining options. An ester containing a methyl group with no -CH₂ groups must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃). This fragment contributes C₂H₃O₂.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the fragments that are required by the NMR data:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester with methyl group: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    *   **Total Carbons:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens:** 2\n\n    The only structure that fits all the spectroscopic details has the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option A. Option D, C₁₂H₁₄O₂, has the correct degree of unsaturation but contains an extra CH₂ unit compared to the structure deduced from the NMR data. The presence of this CH₂ unit is explicitly ruled out by the statement \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\" Therefore, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe provided information and analysis from the various agents converge on a single correct answer through a process of elimination and structural deduction.\n\n### Summary of Analysis\n\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) Calculation**: The first step is to determine the number of rings and pi bonds (double/triple bonds) required by the structure described.\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has a DBE of 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds).\n    *   An ester group (-COO-) contains a C=O double bond, adding 1 to the DBE.\n    *   The presence of vinyl-H signals indicates a C=C double bond, adding another 1 to the DBE.\n    *   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.**\n\n2.  **Filtering Options by DBE**: We can calculate the DBE for each potential formula using `DBE = C + 1 - H/2`.\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6 (Possible)\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6 (Possible)\n    This narrows the correct answer down to either B or D.\n\n3.  **Structural Deduction from NMR**: To distinguish between C₁₂H₁₄O₂ and C₁₁H₁₂O₂, we must assemble the molecule from the fragments identified in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring**: A di-substituted ring provides a **C₆H₄** fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl/Methyl Groups**: The specific splitting pattern (doublet and doublet of quartets) is characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH₃**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Group**: The second -CH₃ signal must belong to the ester. The crucial constraint is \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**\". This means the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃), not an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). This fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n4.  **Final Formula Calculation**: Summing the atoms from the deduced fragments:\n    *   **Carbons**: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens**: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester's methyl) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens**: 2 (ester)\n    *   The formula derived from the spectral evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis matches option D. Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is incorrect because it contains an extra CH₂ unit compared to the deduced structure, which would produce a -CH₂ signal in the NMR, directly contradicting the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided options.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information from the Prompt:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core of this structure is a C₆H₄ fragment.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed clues.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** Consistent with the four protons on a C₆H₄ ring. The limited number of signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, like 1,4-(para).\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a highly specific splitting pattern that is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). This fragment accounts for three carbons and five hydrogens (C₃H₅).\n        *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester.\n        *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical negative constraint. It rules out any ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a methylene (-CH₂-) unit. For the ester to contain the second methyl group without a methylene group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃).\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified, non-overlapping molecular pieces:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring Core:** C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** -C₃H₅\n    *   **Ester and second Methyl Group:** This must be a fragment like a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    A molecule's DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6**.\n    *   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    The DoU matches perfectly.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 6. While the DoU is correct, this formula contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the one derived from the spectral data. This is explicitly contradicted by the \"no –CH₂ groups\" rule.\n    *   B) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6. This formula perfectly matches the one derived from a detailed analysis of all the spectral data.\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 5. Incorrect DoU. This formula lacks a double bond or ring that is required by the data.\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 7. Incorrect DoU. This formula has an extra double bond or ring not supported by the data.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, only C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information\nThe first step is to translate the raw spectral data into structural fragments of the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the formula options.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It eliminates any possibility of having an ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), or similar alkyl chain in the molecule.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a highly specific and informative splitting pattern. It is the classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.\n    *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the two methyl groups. Its formula is **-C₃H₅**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\nNow, we combine the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and find its formula.\n\n1.  We have the aromatic ring: **C₆H₄**\n2.  We have the propenyl group: **-C₃H₅**\n3.  We have an ester group (-COO-) and a second methyl group (-CH₃). The \"no -CH₂-\" rule dictates that this second methyl group must be part of the ester, forming a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**. This fragment contributes **-C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\nLet's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe chemical formula deduced from all the spectral evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) and Evaluate Options\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from structure:** 1 (ring) + 3 (ring double bonds) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from formulas:**\n    *   **A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. This matches.\n    *   **B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. This does not match. It lacks a double bond.\n    *   **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This does not match. It has an extra ring or double bond.\n    *   **D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. The DoU matches, but this formula has an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived formula. The presence of a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided information—the aromatic ring, the ester, the specific propenyl group splitting pattern, and the crucial absence of any -CH₂- signals—is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",
