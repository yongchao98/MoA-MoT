To determine the number of possible products, we must analyze all potential reaction pathways.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n\nThe first step is the abstraction of a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom by the strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. This pathway forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond), this is the major pathway.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is a slower but still possible reaction. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider the outcomes from both benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. Protonation of the resulting carbanion at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. Protonation of the resulting carbanion at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The nucleophile attacks the C1-C2 triple bond. Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, attack at either C1 or C2 leads to the same single product after protonation.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.

This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at C1 and a deuterium isotope at C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base, providing the amide anion (NH₂⁻).\n*   **Mechanism:** These conditions are characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Elimination Phase - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe first step is the abstraction of a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. In this molecule, there are two distinct ortho positions: C2 (with a deuterium, D) and C6 (with a hydrogen, H).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE).** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Therefore, the base (NH₂⁻) will abstract the proton from C6 more rapidly than the deuteron from C2.\n*   **Careful Point 2: \"Possible\" Products.** The question asks for all *possible* products, not just the major ones. Therefore, both abstraction pathways must be considered, even though one is slower.\n\nThis leads to two distinct elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.

However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so both pathways must be considered.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2.

There are two such positions:\n\n1.  **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n\nBecause the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), abstraction of the proton from C6 is faster. However, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is still a possible pathway. Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed:\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major):** Abstraction of H from C6, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, results in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (Minor):** Abstraction of D from C2, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, results in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process, yielding the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. Subsequent protonation yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. Subsequent protonation yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    This pathway produces two distinct products.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):** The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, attack at either carbon followed by protonation yields the same single product: **aniline**.\n    This pathway produces one product.\n\n**Step 3: Counting the Total Possible Products**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.

This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium isotope (D) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃).

The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond), this is the major, faster pathway.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is a slower but still possible reaction. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider the outcomes from both benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe second stage is the addition of the nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), to the benzyne intermediates.

The nucleophile can attack either carbon.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the intermediate contains no deuterium.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH₂⁻ attacks either C1 or C2. Since the intermediate is symmetrical and has no isotopic label, both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which upon protonation yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.

The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂), which provides the very strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻). This base will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\nThere are two ortho positions:\n1.  **C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. This pathway is faster due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are weaker than C-D bonds). The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at C2. This is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower but still possible. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.

NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base, providing the amide anion (NH₂⁻).\n*   **Mechanism:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Note on Kinetics:** Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond. Therefore, this is the major, faster pathway.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. This is a slower but still possible reaction. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate formed is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider the outcomes from both benzyne intermediates, even though one is formed via a minor pathway.\n\n**Step 3: The Addition Step - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe second step is the addition of the nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile can attack either of these two carbons.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and this intermediate contains no deuterium.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH₂⁻ attacks either C1 or C2. Due to the symmetry of the intermediate, both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which upon protonation yields a single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion - Counting the Total Number of Possible Products**\nBy considering all possible elimination and addition steps, we identify three structurally distinct organic products (isotopomers):\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond), this is the major pathway.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is a slower but still possible reaction. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2.

The base removes H⁺ from C6, and subsequently, Br⁻ is eliminated from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2.** Although slower, the abstraction of the deuteron is still a possible reaction. The base removes D⁺ from C2, and Br⁻ is eliminated from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.

The key is to identify all possible reaction pathways and the unique products they form.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n\nThe reaction begins with the deprotonation of the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, by the strong base, sodium amide (NaNH₂). The amide ion (NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. There are two such positions:\n\n1.  **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n\nBecause the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), abstraction of the proton from C6 is faster. However, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is still a possible pathway. Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed:\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major):** Abstraction of H from C6, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, results in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (Minor):** Abstraction of D from C2, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, results in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process, yielding the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. Subsequent protonation yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. Subsequent protonation yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    This pathway produces two distinct products.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):** The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, attack at either carbon followed by protonation yields the same single product: **aniline**.\n    This pathway produces one product.\n\n**Step 3: Counting the Total Possible Products**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of an elimination-addition reaction involving a benzyne intermediate, with careful consideration of isotopic labeling.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium isotope (D) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an exceptionally strong base, providing the amide anion (NH₂⁻).\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The combination of an aryl halide and a very strong base points to a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond), this is the major, faster pathway.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is a slower but still possible reaction. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider the outcomes from both benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe second stage is the addition of the nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), to the benzyne intermediates.

The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the intermediate contains no deuterium.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH₂⁻ attacks either C1 or C2. Since the intermediate is symmetrical and has no isotopic label, both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which upon protonation yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.

Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen, at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base, providing the amide anion (NH₂⁻).\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like sodium amide proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, which involves a highly reactive intermediate known as **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate formed is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is significantly faster and is the major pathway. However, Pathway B is still possible and will occur to a lesser extent. Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both intermediates.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe second step is the addition of the nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile can attack either of these two carbons.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When renumbered to give the amino group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and this intermediate contains no deuterium.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH₂⁻ attacks either C1 or C2. Due to the symmetry of the intermediate, both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which upon protonation yields a single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\nBy considering all possible elimination and addition steps, we identify three structurally distinct organic products (isotopomers):\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
