This is the ratio P₃ / P₁.\n\n**1. Identify Relevant Physical Principles:**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on its star's luminosity, its albedo (A), and its orbital distance (a). For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the relationship simplifies to the equilibrium temperature being inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n    *   `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a`\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    *   `P² ∝ a³` or `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\n**2. Identify Given and Extraneous Information:**\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Ratio of temperatures: T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ ≈ 1.4\n    *   Ratio of temperatures: T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ ≈ 2.3\n    *   Albedo is equal for all three planets.\n*   **Extraneous:**\n    *   The specific albedo value (0.3).\n    *   The ratios of the masses of the planets.\n    *   The discovery method (TTV). This information is not needed for the calculation based on the fundamental principles of orbital mechanics and thermodynamics.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nThere are two primary methods to solve this, both used by the candidate agents.\n\n**Method 1: Chaining Ratios Step-by-Step**\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of orbital distances (a₃ / a₁):**\n    *   From `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`, we can derive `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Therefore, `a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = 1.4² = 1.96`.\n    *   And `a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = 2.3² = 5.29`.\n    *   To find the total ratio `a₃ / a₁`, multiply the intermediate ratios: `a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`.\n\n2.  **Find the ratio of orbital periods (P₃ / P₁):**\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law, `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n    *   Therefore, `P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)`.\n    *   `P₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈ 33.386`.\n\n**Method 2: Deriving a Direct Relationship**\n\n1.  **Relate Period (P) directly to Temperature (T_eq):**\n    *   We have `a ∝ T_eq⁻²` and `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n    *   Substitute the expression for `a` into the expression for `P`: `P ∝ (T_eq⁻²)^(3/2) = T_eq⁻³`.\n    *   This shows the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n2.  **Calculate the period ratio:**\n    *   `P₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³`.\n    *   First, find the temperature ratio `T_eq₁ / T_eq₃` by multiplying the given ratios: `T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂) * (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Now, cube this value: `P₃ / P₁ = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`.\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** Both valid methods yield the same result: the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately **33.4**.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the value of ~33.4.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The primary source of error among the candidate answers is incorrectly matching the calculated value to the lettered options (A, B, C, D), likely due to inconsistent option lists. Based on the options provided in the problem description:\n    *   A) ~ 4.4\n    *   B) ~ 10.4\n    *   C) ~ 3.2\n    *   D) ~ 33.4\n*   The calculated value of ~33.4 correctly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the correct physical principles and the final numerical result, despite some confusion in matching the result to the multiple-choice letters.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the ratio of the orbital periods (P₃ / P₁). This can be solved by establishing a chain of relationships between the given and desired quantities.\n\n**1. Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) and Orbital Distance (a)**\n\n*   **Principle**: The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (semi-major axis for circular orbits).\n*   **Formula**: T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n*   **Implication for Ratios**: This means the ratio of the orbital distances is equal to the inverse square of the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)²\n\n**2. Relationship between Orbital Distance (a) and Orbital Period (P)**\n\n*   **Principle**: Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.\n*   **Formula**: P² ∝ a³\n*   **Implication for Ratios**: The ratio of the orbital periods is equal to the ratio of their orbital distances raised to the power of 3/2:\n    P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n### Calculation\n\nFollowing the principles above, the calculation proceeds in two main stages:\n\n**Stage 1: Calculate the ratio of the orbital distances (a₃ / a₁)**\n\nFirst, we find the individual distance ratios from the given temperature ratios:\n*   Given T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ ≈ 1.4, the distance ratio is:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (1.4)² = 1.96\n*   Given T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ ≈ 2.3, the distance ratio is:\n    a₃ / a₂ = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nNext, we find the total distance ratio between Planet 3 and Planet 1 by multiplying the intermediate ratios:\n*   a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n**Stage 2: Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (P₃ / P₁)**\n\nUsing the result from Stage 1 and Kepler's Third Law:\n*   P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n*   P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem includes information about the planets' mass ratios and the TTV discovery method. As correctly identified by most of the candidate answers, this information is not needed for the calculation. Kepler's Third Law in this form assumes planetary masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, and the albedo's specific value is irrelevant as long as it is constant for all planets.\n*   **Alternative Method**: Several answers correctly used an alternative, more direct method by first deriving the relationship P ∝ 1 / T_eq³. This leads to P₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³. Calculating T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = (1.4 * 2.3) = 3.22, and then (3.22)³ also yields ≈ 33.386. This confirms the result.\n*   **Final Answer Selection**: The overwhelming majority of the provided solutions correctly calculate the numerical answer to be approximately 33.4. Comparing this result to the options given in the question:\n    A) ~ 3.2\n    B) ~ 10.4\n    C) ~ 4.4\n    D) ~ 33.4\n\nThe calculated factor matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem asks for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 ($P_3/P_1$). To solve this, we must connect the given information about equilibrium temperatures to the orbital periods. This is a multi-step process involving two key physical principles.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Relevant Information and Principles:**\n    *   **Given Ratios:**\n        *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: $T_1 / T_2 \\approx 1.4$\n        *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: $T_2 / T_3 \\approx 2.3$\n    *   **Constants:** The planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo. This is crucial.\n    *   **Extraneous Information:** The specific albedo value (0.3), the planet masses, and the TTV discovery method are not needed for this calculation and serve as distractors.\n    *   **Principle 1: Equilibrium Temperature.** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, $a$) by the formula $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$, because all other factors (star's luminosity, albedo) are constant for all three planets.\n    *   **Principle 2: Kepler's Third Law.** The orbital period ($P$) is related to the orbital distance ($a$) by $P^2 \\propto a^3$, or $P \\propto a^{3/2}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances ($a_3/a_1$):**\n    *   From Principle 1, we can rearrange to find the relationship for distance: $a \\propto 1/T_{eq}^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of distances is the inverse square of the ratio of temperatures: $a_j/a_i = (T_i/T_j)^2$.\n    *   First, find the ratio of distances for planets 1 and 2:\n        $a_2/a_1 = (T_1/T_2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$.\n    *   Next, find the ratio for planets 2 and 3:\n        $a_3/a_2 = (T_2/T_3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$.\n    *   To find the total ratio of the distance of Planet3 to Planet1, we multiply the intermediate ratios:\n        $a_3/a_1 = (a_3/a_2) \\times (a_2/a_1) = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods ($P_3/P_1$):**\n    *   Using Principle 2 ($P \\propto a^{3/2}$), we can find the period ratio from the distance ratio:\n        $P_3/P_1 = (a_3/a_1)^{3/2}$.\n    *   Substitute the value calculated in the previous step:\n        $P_3/P_1 = (10.3684)^{3/2} \\approx 33.386$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated factor is approximately 33.4. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~ 33.4\n    *   B) ~ 3.2\n    *   C) ~ 10.4\n    *   D) ~ 4.4\n\n    The result matches option A.\n\n### Analysis of Agent Answers\nAlmost all agents correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the numerical answer of ~33.4. However, many of them incorrectly map this result to the final letter choice.

This is the ratio P₃ / P₁.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on its star's luminosity, its albedo (A), and its orbital distance (a). The relationship is T_eq ∝ [(1-A)/a²]^(1/4). Since all three planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, this simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/√a.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). This is written as P² ∝ a³.\n\n3.  **List Careful Points and Distractors:**\n    *   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the ratios of the planets' masses and the specific value of the albedo (0.3). This information is not needed for the calculation. The masses are considered negligible compared to the star's mass for this application of Kepler's Law, and the albedo value is irrelevant as long as it is the same for all planets, allowing it to cancel out in the ratios. The mention of the TTV method is also just background context.\n    *   **Correctly Applying Exponents:** It is crucial to use the correct powers in the formulas: T_eq ∝ a⁻¹/² and P ∝ a³/².\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   **Part A:** Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratio of the orbital distances between Planet 3 and Planet 1 (a₃/a₁).\n    *   **Part B:** Use the result from Part A and Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods (P₃/P₁).\n\n### Executing the Plan\n\n**Part A: Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a₃/a₁)**\n\n*   From the temperature relationship T_eq ∝ 1/√a, we can write a ∝ 1/T_eq².\n*   Therefore, the ratio of orbital distances is the inverse square of the temperature ratio: a_j/a_i = (T_i/T_j)².\n*   Calculate the ratio for Planet 1 and 2:\n    a₂/a₁ = (T₁/T₂)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n*   Calculate the ratio for Planet 2 and 3:\n    a₃/a₂ = (T₂/T₃)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n*   To find the total ratio a₃/a₁, multiply the intermediate ratios:\n    a₃/a₁ = (a₃/a₂) * (a₂/a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n**Part B: Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods (P₃/P₁)**\n\n*   From Kepler's Third Law, P ∝ a³/².\n*   Therefore, the ratio of the periods is: P₃/P₁ = (a₃/a₁)^(3/2).\n*   Substitute the value for a₃/a₁ calculated in Part A:\n    P₃/P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n*   Calculating the value:\n    P₃/P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.4.

Identify the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. This is the ratio P₃ / P₁.\n\n### **2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles**\nTwo key physical laws are needed to solve this problem:\n\n*   **The Law of Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on its star's luminosity, its albedo (A), and its distance from the star (semi-major axis, *a*). For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the relationship simplifies to the temperature being inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (*a*).\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n\n### **3. Identify and Discard Extraneous Information**\nThe problem provides extra information that is not needed for the calculation, which can be a common feature in physics problems to test understanding of the core concepts.\n*   **Planet Masses and TTV Method:** The TTV (Transit Timing Variation) method uses the gravitational influence of planets on each other to detect them, which is related to their mass. However, when using the standard form of Kepler's Third Law, the masses of the planets are assumed to be negligible compared to the mass of the star. Therefore, the mass ratios are not needed.\n*   **Specific Albedo Value (0.3):** The crucial piece of information is that the albedo is *the same* for all three planets. This allows the albedo term to cancel out when creating ratios. The specific value of 0.3 is not required.\n\n### **4. Formulate a Plan and Execute the Calculation**\nThere are two valid methods to solve this problem.\n\n**Method A: Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of orbital distances (a₃/a₁).**\n    From the temperature law (T_eq ∝ 1/√a), we can derive that a ∝ 1/T_eq².\n    Therefore, the ratio of distances is the inverse square of the temperature ratio:\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n    *   a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n    Now, combine these to find the total ratio:\n    *   a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n2.  **Use Kepler's Law to find the period ratio (P₃/P₁).**\n    From Kepler's Law (P² ∝ a³), we can derive that P ∝ a^(3/2).\n    *   P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\n3.  **Calculate the final value.**\n    *   P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\n**Method B: Direct Relationship**\n\n1.  **Find the direct relationship between Period (P) and Temperature (T_eq).**\n    *   We know P ∝ a^(3/2) and a ∝ 1/T_eq².\n    *   Substitute the expression for *a* into the expression for *P*:\n    *   P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2) = 1/T_eq³\n    *   This shows the period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n2.  **Calculate the required temperature ratio (T_eq₁/T_eq₃).**\n    *   T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂) * (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n3.  **Calculate the period ratio (P₃/P₁).**\n    *   P₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³ = (3.22)³\n    *   P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nBoth methods yield the same result: the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately **33.4**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to consider.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. This is a request for the ratio P₃ / P₁.\n\n**2. Identify the Necessary Physical Principles**\nTo solve this, we need to connect the given information (temperature ratios) to the desired quantity (period ratio). This requires two key physical laws:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature Relation:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on its distance from the star ('a', the semi-major axis) and its albedo ('A'). For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the relationship simplifies to show that the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    *   P² ∝ a³  or  P ∝ a^(3/2)\n\n**3. Identify and Discard Extraneous Information**\nThe problem provides extra details that are not needed for the calculation. It's important to identify these to avoid confusion:\n*   **Planet Masses:** The ratios of masses are irrelevant because Kepler's Third Law, in its standard form, assumes the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass.\n*   **Albedo Value (0.3):** The specific value of the albedo is not needed. The crucial information is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows it to be canceled out when forming ratios.\n*   **TTV Method:** The method of discovery (Transit Timing Variation) is context but does not factor into the calculation of the period ratio from temperature.\n\n**4. Formulate and Execute the Calculation Plan**\nThere are two valid ways to proceed.\n\n**Method 1: Step-by-Step Conversion**\n\n*   **Step A: Find the ratio of orbital distances from the temperature ratios.**\n    From T_eq ∝ 1/√a, we can derive a ∝ 1/T_eq². Therefore, the ratio of distances is the inverse square of the temperature ratio: a₂/a₁ = (T₁/T₂)²\n    *   Ratio for Planet 1 to 2: a₂/a₁ = (1.4)² = 1.96\n    *   Ratio for Planet 2 to 3: a₃/a₂ = (T₂/T₃)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n*   **Step B: Combine the distance ratios.**\n    To find the total ratio of the distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1, multiply the intermediate ratios:\n    *   a₃/a₁ = (a₃/a₂) * (a₂/a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n*   **Step C: Find the period ratio from the distance ratio.**\n    Using Kepler's Third Law (P ∝ a^(3/2)):\n    *   P₃/P₁ = (a₃/a₁)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5) ≈ 33.386\n\n**Method 2: Direct Relationship**\n\n*   **Step A: Find the direct relationship between Period (P) and Temperature (T_eq).**\n    *   We know P ∝ a^(3/2) and a ∝ 1/T_eq².\n    *   Substitute the expression for 'a' into the expression for 'P': P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2) = 1/T_eq³.\n    *   This shows the period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n*   **Step B: Calculate the total temperature ratio.**\n    *   T₁/T₃ = (T₁/T₂) * (T₂/T₃) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n*   **Step C: Calculate the period ratio.**\n    *   From P ∝ 1/T_eq³, we get P₃/P₁ = (T₁/T₃)³.\n    *   P₃/P₁ = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nBoth methods yield a result of approximately 33.4.

A review of the candidate answers shows that while most derived the correct numerical value, many failed to map it to the correct letter option, which is a common source of error. The physics and the calculation are sound and consistently point to ~33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem is solved by combining two fundamental principles of astrophysics: the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbital distance, and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n**Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo (as stated in the problem), the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`).\n\n*   `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a`\n\nFrom this, we can derive the relationship for the ratio of orbital distances between two planets (`i` and `j`):\n\n*   `a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)²`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances**\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n*   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4`\n*   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3`\n\nUsing these, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n*   `a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = 1.4² = 1.96`\n*   `a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = 2.3² = 5.29`\n\nTo find the total ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 (`a3 / a1`), we multiply the intermediate ratios:\n*   `a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`\n\n**Step 3: Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`).\n\n*   `P² ∝ a³` or `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\nThe ratio of the orbital periods of two planets is therefore:\n\n*   `P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2)`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n\nUsing the orbital distance ratio calculated in Step 2, we can find the desired period ratio (`P3 / P1`):\n\n*   `P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)`\n*   `P3 / P1 ≈ 33.39`\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.

This can be solved by establishing a chain of physical relationships.\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) to Orbital Distance (a):**\n    The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula shows that for planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (semi-major axis for a circular orbit).\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    This means the orbital distance is inversely proportional to the square of the temperature:\n    *   a ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital distances for two planets (i and j) is:\n    *   aⱼ / aᵢ = (T_eqᵢ / T_eqⱼ)²\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a₃ / a₁):**\n    Using the given temperature ratios, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances.\n    *   Given: T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ ≈ 1.4\n    *   Ratio of distances for Planet 1 and 2: a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n    *   Given: T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ ≈ 2.3\n    *   Ratio of distances for Planet 2 and 3: a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n    To find the total ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1, we multiply the intermediate ratios:\n    *   a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n    This means the period is proportional to the distance raised to the power of 3/2:\n    *   P ∝ a^(3/2)\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods for two planets is:\n    *   Pⱼ / Pᵢ = (aⱼ / aᵢ)^(3/2)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ratio of Orbital Periods (P₃ / P₁):**\n    Now, we substitute the calculated ratio of the orbital distances into the period ratio formula:\n    *   P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n    *   P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem includes information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method. This information is irrelevant to the calculation, as Kepler's Third Law in this form assumes planetary masses are negligible compared to the star's mass.\n*   **Albedo Value:** The specific albedo value of 0.3 is also not needed. The critical piece of information is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows it to be canceled out when forming the temperature-distance relationship.\n*   **Correct Physical Laws:** The solution depends entirely on the correct application of the equilibrium temperature formula (T_eq ∝ 1/√a) and Kepler's Third Law (P² ∝ a³).\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The calculation involves squaring numbers and then raising a result to the power of 1.5. Errors in these steps can lead to incorrect answers. The consistent result across the majority of the candidate answers confirms the calculation of ~33.4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation robustly shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.

This requires linking the given information about equilibrium temperatures to the orbital periods. The majority of the provided solutions correctly identify that this can be done using two fundamental physical principles:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature vs. Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a), assuming the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo. The problem states both conditions are met.\n    *   **Relationship:** T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    *   **Ratio Form:** a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)²\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its orbital distance (a).\n    *   **Relationship:** P² ∝ a³\n    *   **Ratio Form:** P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n### Careful Points and Extraneous Information\n\n*   **Planet Masses and TTV:** The information about the planet masses and their discovery via the Transit-Timing Variation (TTV) method is extraneous. Kepler's Third Law in its standard form assumes planetary masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard and valid assumption for this type of problem.\n*   **Albedo Value:** The specific albedo value of 0.3 is also extraneous. The only crucial piece of information is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows for the simple proportionality between temperature and orbital distance.\n*   **Inconsistent Options:** The candidate answers show that the letters (A, B, C, D) corresponding to the numerical values are not consistent. Therefore, the decision must be based on calculating the correct numerical value and then matching it to the options provided in the original question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nThe most direct method, agreed upon by the vast majority of the candidate answers, is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the orbital distances (a₃ / a₁).**\n\nFirst, we find the individual ratios of orbital distances from the given temperature ratios:\n*   The ratio of distances between Planet 2 and Planet 1 is:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n*   The ratio of distances between Planet 3 and Planet 2 is:\n    a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nNext, we combine these to find the total ratio of the distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1:\n*   a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (P₃ / P₁).**\n\nUsing the result from Step 1 and applying Kepler's Third Law:\n*   P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n*   P₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n*   P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\n**Alternative Method**\n\nSeveral answers correctly use a more direct relationship derived by combining the two principles first:\n*   Since P ∝ a^(3/2) and a ∝ 1/T_eq², we can substitute to get:\n    P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)  =>  P ∝ 1/T_eq³\n*   Therefore, P₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³.\n*   First, find the temperature ratio: T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂) * (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n*   Then, calculate the period ratio: P₃ / P₁ = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is approximately **33.4**. Comparing this numerical result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a consistent calculation method, although there are discrepancies in the final letter choice. The correct approach involves a two-step process using fundamental principles of astrophysics.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on its distance from the star (`a`, the semi-major axis) and its albedo (`A`). The relationship is $T_{eq} \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{1-A}{a^2}}$. Since the albedo (`A`) is the same for all three planets and they orbit the same star, this simplifies to $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$.\n    From this, we can derive the ratio of the orbital distances from the ratio of the temperatures:\n    $\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = (\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}})^2$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a3 / a1):**\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\approx 2.3$\n\n    First, we find the ratio of the orbital distances for the adjacent pairs:\n    *   $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}})^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n    *   $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = (\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}})^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\n    Next, we find the total ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 by multiplying the intermediate ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`), or $P^2 \\propto a^3$.\n    This gives the relationship for the ratio of periods:\n    $\\frac{P_j}{P_i} = (\\frac{a_j}{a_i})^{3/2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods (P3 / P1):**\n    Using the orbital distance ratio calculated in the previous step:\n    *   $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{1.5}$\n    *   $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\approx 33.386$\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem includes information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method. This information is irrelevant to the question asked and is designed to test the understanding of the core physical principles. The specific value of the albedo (0.3) is also not needed, only the fact that it is the same for all planets.\n*   **Correct Physical Laws:** The solution relies solely on the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance, and on Kepler's Third Law.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The calculation involves chaining ratios and applying fractional exponents. A mistake in either of these steps would lead to an incorrect result. For instance, simply cubing the ratio of the orbital distances (10.37³) or using the temperature ratio directly would be incorrect.\n*   **Matching Result to Options:** The calculated value of ~33.4 must be correctly matched to the given options.

The relationship is T_eq ∝ [(1-A)/a²]¹/⁴. Since the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, this simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/√a.

The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (`a`), i.e., `T_eq ∝ a⁻¹/²`.\n2.  Kepler's Third Law states that a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to its orbital distance to the power of 3/2, i.e., `P ∝ a³/²`.\n\nCombining these principles establishes a direct relationship between period and temperature: `P ∝ T_eq⁻³`.

The correct numerical result is overwhelmingly supported by the derivations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires finding the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 (P₃ / P₁). This can be solved by combining the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance with Kepler's Third Law.\n\n**1. Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*) by the proportionality:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nThis is because the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, making all other factors in the equilibrium temperature equation constant. From this, the ratio of the orbital distances can be expressed as the inverse square of the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\na₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)²\n\n**2.

Application of Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (*a*):\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis means the ratio of the orbital periods is related to the ratio of the semi-major axes as follows:\nP₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstituting the calculated orbital distance ratio into the equation from Kepler's Law:\nP₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2)\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value rounds to approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem includes several pieces of information that are not needed for the calculation. These act as distractors to test the understanding of the underlying physical principles.\n    *   **Planet Masses**: The ratios of the planet masses are irrelevant. Kepler's Third Law, in this form, assumes that the planets' masses are negligible compared to the mass of the star they orbit.\n    *   **TTV Method**: The mention of the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method is also irrelevant to the question asked.\n    *   **Albedo Value**: The specific albedo value of 0.3 is not needed. The only important detail is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows it to be canceled out when creating the proportionality between temperature and orbital distance.\n*   **Inconsistent Candidate Answers**: While most candidate answers perform the calculation correctly, several select the wrong letter for their final answer. This is likely due to inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options across different versions. However, the numerical result of ~33.4 is consistently derived in the correct solutions.\n\nBased on the calculation, the factor is ~33.4, which corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including a list of careful points to consider, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe goal is to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1. This is the ratio P₃ / P₁.\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star, its albedo (A), and its distance from the star (a). The relationship is T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a².\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the relationship simplifies to:\n    T_eq⁴ ∝ 1 / a²\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides gives:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    This means the ratio of orbital distances is the inverse square of the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)²\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period:**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). For the circular orbits mentioned, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance.\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This means the ratio of orbital periods is related to the ratio of orbital distances as follows:\n    P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a₃ / a₁):**\n    We are given the temperature ratios and can use the relationship from Step 1.\n    *   First, find the ratio for Planet 2 to Planet 1:\n        a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n    *   Next, find the ratio for Planet 3 to Planet 2:\n        a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n    *   To find the total ratio a₃ / a₁, multiply the intermediate ratios:\n        a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods (P₃ / P₁):**\n    Using the result from Step 3 and the relationship from Step 2:\n    P₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n    P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated value is approximately 33.4. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~ 33.4\n    *   B) ~ 10.4\n    *   C) ~ 3.2\n    *   D) ~ 4.4\n\n    The result matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem includes several pieces of information that are not needed for the calculation. This is a common technique in physics problems to test understanding of the underlying principles.\n    *   **Planet Masses:** The ratios of the masses are irrelevant. Kepler's Third Law in its simple form (P² ∝ a³) is a very accurate approximation when the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard assumption.\n    *   **TTV Method:** The mention of the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method, which detects gravitational influences between planets, might suggest that the masses are significant. However, for calculating the fundamental period ratios, these effects are considered perturbations on the main orbit defined by the star's gravity. The core relationship from Kepler's Law still holds.\n    *   **Albedo Value:** The specific albedo value of 0.3 is not needed. The crucial information is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows it to be canceled out when forming the temperature ratios.\n*   **Consistency of Logic:** As shown in the analysis of the candidate answers, there are two valid logical paths to the solution: a two-step method involving the orbital distance `a`, or a direct method relating period to temperature (P ∝ T_eq⁻³). Both yield the same numerical result.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** A significant number of the provided candidate answers perform the calculation correctly but fail to select the corresponding option letter.

This information is not needed for the calculation based on the fundamental principles of orbital mechanics and thermodynamics.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nThere are two primary methods to solve this, both used by the candidate agents.\n\n**Method 1: Chaining Ratios Step-by-Step**\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of orbital distances (a₃ / a₁):**\n    *   From `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`, we can derive `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Therefore, `a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = 1.4² = 1.96`.\n    *   And `a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = 2.3² = 5.29`.\n    *   To find the total ratio `a₃ / a₁`, multiply the intermediate ratios: `a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`.\n\n2.  **Find the ratio of orbital periods (P₃ / P₁):**\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law, `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n    *   Therefore, `P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)`.\n    *   `P₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈ 33.386`.\n\n**Method 2: Deriving a Direct Relationship**\n\n1.  **Relate Period (P) directly to Temperature (T_eq):**\n    *   We have `a ∝ T_eq⁻²` and `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n    *   Substitute the expression for `a` into the expression for `P`: `P ∝ (T_eq⁻²)^(3/2) = T_eq⁻³`.\n    *   This shows the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n2.  **Calculate the period ratio:**\n    *   `P₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³`.\n    *   First, find the temperature ratio `T_eq₁ / T_eq₃` by multiplying the given ratios: `T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂) * (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Now, cube this value: `P₃ / P₁ = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`.\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** Both valid methods yield the same result: the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately **33.4**.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the value of ~33.4.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The primary source of error among the candidate answers is incorrectly matching the calculated value to the lettered options (A, B, C, D), likely due to inconsistent option lists. Based on the options provided in the problem description:\n    *   A) ~ 4.4\n    *   B) ~ 10.4\n    *   C) ~ 3.2\n    *   D) ~ 33.4\n*   The calculated value of ~33.4 correctly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the correct physical principles and the final numerical result, despite some confusion in matching the result to the multiple-choice letters.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the ratio of the orbital periods (P₃ / P₁). This can be solved by establishing a chain of relationships between the given and desired quantities.\n\n**1. Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) and Orbital Distance (a)**\n\n*   **Principle**: The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (semi-major axis for circular orbits).\n*   **Formula**: T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n*   **Implication for Ratios**: This means the ratio of the orbital distances is equal to the inverse square of the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)²\n\n**2. Relationship between Orbital Distance (a) and Orbital Period (P)**\n\n*   **Principle**: Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.\n*   **Formula**: P² ∝ a³\n*   **Implication for Ratios**: The ratio of the orbital periods is equal to the ratio of their orbital distances raised to the power of 3/2:\n    P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n### Calculation\n\nFollowing the principles above, the calculation proceeds in two main stages:\n\n**Stage 1: Calculate the ratio of the orbital distances (a₃ / a₁)**\n\nFirst, we find the individual distance ratios from the given temperature ratios:\n*   Given T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ ≈ 1.4, the distance ratio is:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (1.4)² = 1.96\n*   Given T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ ≈ 2.3, the distance ratio is:\n    a₃ / a₂ = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nNext, we find the total distance ratio between Planet 3 and Planet 1 by multiplying the intermediate ratios:\n*   a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n**Stage 2: Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (P₃ / P₁)**\n\nUsing the result from Stage 1 and Kepler's Third Law:\n*   P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n*   P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem includes information about the planets' mass ratios and the TTV discovery method. As correctly identified by most of the candidate answers, this information is not needed for the calculation. Kepler's Third Law in this form assumes planetary masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, and the albedo's specific value is irrelevant as long as it is constant for all planets.\n*   **Alternative Method**: Several answers correctly used an alternative, more direct method by first deriving the relationship P ∝ 1 / T_eq³. This leads to P₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³. Calculating T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = (1.4 * 2.3) = 3.22, and then (3.22)³ also yields ≈ 33.386. This confirms the result.\n*   **Final Answer Selection**: The overwhelming majority of the provided solutions correctly calculate the numerical answer to be approximately 33.4.

To solve this, we must connect the given information about equilibrium temperatures to the orbital periods. This is a multi-step process involving two key physical principles.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Relevant Information and Principles:**\n    *   **Given Ratios:**\n        *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: $T_1 / T_2 \\approx 1.4$\n        *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: $T_2 / T_3 \\approx 2.3$\n    *   **Constants:** The planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo. This is crucial.\n    *   **Extraneous Information:** The specific albedo value (0.3), the planet masses, and the TTV discovery method are not needed for this calculation and serve as distractors.\n    *   **Principle 1: Equilibrium Temperature.** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, $a$) by the formula $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$, because all other factors (star's luminosity, albedo) are constant for all three planets.\n    *   **Principle 2: Kepler's Third Law.** The orbital period ($P$) is related to the orbital distance ($a$) by $P^2 \\propto a^3$, or $P \\propto a^{3/2}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances ($a_3/a_1$):**\n    *   From Principle 1, we can rearrange to find the relationship for distance: $a \\propto 1/T_{eq}^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of distances is the inverse square of the ratio of temperatures: $a_j/a_i = (T_i/T_j)^2$.\n    *   First, find the ratio of distances for planets 1 and 2:\n        $a_2/a_1 = (T_1/T_2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$.\n    *   Next, find the ratio for planets 2 and 3:\n        $a_3/a_2 = (T_2/T_3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$.\n    *   To find the total ratio of the distance of Planet3 to Planet1, we multiply the intermediate ratios:\n        $a_3/a_1 = (a_3/a_2) \\times (a_2/a_1) = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods ($P_3/P_1$):**\n    *   Using Principle 2 ($P \\propto a^{3/2}$), we can find the period ratio from the distance ratio:\n        $P_3/P_1 = (a_3/a_1)^{3/2}$.\n    *   Substitute the value calculated in the previous step:\n        $P_3/P_1 = (10.3684)^{3/2} \\approx 33.386$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated factor is approximately 33.4.

This is the ratio P₃ / P₁.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on its star's luminosity, its albedo (A), and its orbital distance (a). The relationship is T_eq ∝ [(1-A)/a²]^(1/4). Since all three planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, this simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/√a.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). This is written as P² ∝ a³.\n\n3.  **List Careful Points and Distractors:**\n    *   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the ratios of the planets' masses and the specific value of the albedo (0.3). This information is not needed for the calculation. The masses are considered negligible compared to the star's mass for this application of Kepler's Law, and the albedo value is irrelevant as long as it is the same for all planets, allowing it to cancel out in the ratios.

This can be solved by establishing a chain of physical relationships.\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) to Orbital Distance (a):**\n    The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula shows that for planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (semi-major axis for a circular orbit).\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    This means the orbital distance is inversely proportional to the square of the temperature:\n    *   a ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital distances for two planets (i and j) is:\n    *   aⱼ / aᵢ = (T_eqᵢ / T_eqⱼ)²\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a₃ / a₁):**\n    Using the given temperature ratios, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances.\n    *   Given: T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ ≈ 1.4\n    *   Ratio of distances for Planet 1 and 2: a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n    *   Given: T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ ≈ 2.3\n    *   Ratio of distances for Planet 2 and 3: a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n    To find the total ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1, we multiply the intermediate ratios:\n    *   a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n    This means the period is proportional to the distance raised to the power of 3/2:\n    *   P ∝ a^(3/2)\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods for two planets is:\n    *   Pⱼ / Pᵢ = (aⱼ / aᵢ)^(3/2)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ratio of Orbital Periods (P₃ / P₁):**\n    Now, we substitute the calculated ratio of the orbital distances into the period ratio formula:\n    *   P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n    *   P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem includes information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method.

This requires linking the given information about equilibrium temperatures to the orbital periods. The majority of the provided solutions correctly identify that this can be done using two fundamental physical principles:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature vs. Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a), assuming the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo.

Kepler's Third Law in its standard form assumes planetary masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard and valid assumption for this type of problem.\n*   **Albedo Value:** The specific albedo value of 0.3 is also extraneous. The only crucial piece of information is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows for the simple proportionality between temperature and orbital distance.\n*   **Inconsistent Options:** The candidate answers show that the letters (A, B, C, D) corresponding to the numerical values are not consistent.

Comparing this numerical result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a consistent calculation method, although there are discrepancies in the final letter choice. The correct approach involves a two-step process using fundamental principles of astrophysics.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on its distance from the star (`a`, the semi-major axis) and its albedo (`A`). The relationship is $T_{eq} \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{1-A}{a^2}}$. Since the albedo (`A`) is the same for all three planets and they orbit the same star, this simplifies to $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$.\n    From this, we can derive the ratio of the orbital distances from the ratio of the temperatures:\n    $\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = (\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}})^2$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a3 / a1):**\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\approx 2.3$\n\n    First, we find the ratio of the orbital distances for the adjacent pairs:\n    *   $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}})^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n    *   $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = (\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}})^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\n    Next, we find the total ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 by multiplying the intermediate ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`), or $P^2 \\propto a^3$.\n    This gives the relationship for the ratio of periods:\n    $\\frac{P_j}{P_i} = (\\frac{a_j}{a_i})^{3/2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods (P3 / P1):**\n    Using the orbital distance ratio calculated in the previous step:\n    *   $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{1.5}$\n    *   $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\approx 33.386$\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem includes information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method. This information is irrelevant to the question asked and is designed to test the understanding of the core physical principles. The specific value of the albedo (0.3) is also not needed, only the fact that it is the same for all planets.\n*   **Correct Physical Laws:** The solution relies solely on the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance, and on Kepler's Third Law.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The calculation involves chaining ratios and applying fractional exponents. A mistake in either of these steps would lead to an incorrect result. For instance, simply cubing the ratio of the orbital distances (10.37³) or using the temperature ratio directly would be incorrect.\n*   **Matching Result to Options:** The calculated value of ~33.4 must be correctly matched to the given options.

This is the ratio P₃ / P₁.\n\n2.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star, its albedo (A), and its orbital distance (a). The relationship is T_eq ∝ [(1-A)/a²]¹/⁴. Since the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, this simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/√a. This means the orbital distance is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature (a ∝ 1/T_eq²).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a₃/a₁):**\n    *   We are given the temperature ratios: T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ ≈ 1.4 and T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ ≈ 2.3.\n    *   Using the relationship from Step 2, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n        *   a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = 1.4² = 1.96.\n        *   a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = 2.3² = 5.29.\n    *   To find the total ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1, we multiply the intermediate ratios:\n        *   a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684.\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), i.e., P² ∝ a³. This can be written as P ∝ a^(3/2).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods (P₃/P₁):**\n    *   Using the relationship from Kepler's Third Law, we can find the period ratio from the distance ratio calculated in Step 3:\n        *   P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2).\n    *   Substituting the value:\n        *   P₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈ 33.386.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value is approximately 33.4.

This is a common technique to test a firm understanding of the underlying physical principles. The irrelevant information includes the ratios of the planet masses, the specific value of the albedo (the fact that it is *equal* for all three is what matters), and the TTV discovery method.\n*   **Correct Physical Laws:** The solution depends entirely on the correct application of the equilibrium temperature formula and Kepler's Third Law.\n*   **Mathematical Path:** The calculation can be done in two main ways, both yielding the same result:\n    1.  A two-step process of finding the distance ratio first, then the period ratio (as shown above).\n    2.  Deriving a direct relationship between period and temperature (P ∝ 1/T_eq³) and then calculating P₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³ = (1.4 * 2.3)³ ≈ 33.4.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the method and perform the calculation to arrive at ~33.4. Several answers, however, make a mistake in selecting the final letter corresponding to their result, highlighting the need for careful checking.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully executed the plan to determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\n\nThe core of the solution lies in two physical principles:\n1.  The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (`a`), i.e., `T_eq ∝ a⁻¹/²`.\n2.  Kepler's Third Law states that a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to its orbital distance to the power of 3/2, i.e., `P ∝ a³/²`.\n\nCombining these principles establishes a direct relationship between period and temperature: `P ∝ T_eq⁻³`. Therefore, the ratio of the periods `P3 / P1` is equal to the cube of the inverse temperature ratio, `(T1 / T3)³`.\n\nThe code first calculated the overall temperature ratio `T1 / T3` by multiplying the given intermediate ratios: `1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`. Then, it cubed this value to find the period ratio: `(3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`.\n\nThis calculated value of approximately 33.4 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a consistent and correct method for solving the problem, although some answers contain errors in their final letter choice. The correct numerical result is overwhelmingly supported by the derivations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires finding the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 (P₃ / P₁). This can be solved by combining the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance with Kepler's Third Law.\n\n**1. Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*) by the proportionality:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nThis is because the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, making all other factors in the equilibrium temperature equation constant. From this, the ratio of the orbital distances can be expressed as the inverse square of the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\na₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)²\n\n**2. Calculation of the Orbital Distance Ratio (a₃ / a₁)**\n\nUsing the given temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ ≈ 2.3\n\nWe can calculate the ratios of the orbital distances:\n*   The ratio between Planet 1 and 2: a₂ / a₁ = (1.4)² = 1.96\n*   The ratio between Planet 2 and 3: a₃ / a₂ = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nTo find the total ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1, we multiply the intermediate ratios:\na₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n**3. Application of Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (*a*):\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis means the ratio of the orbital periods is related to the ratio of the semi-major axes as follows:\nP₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstituting the calculated orbital distance ratio into the equation from Kepler's Law:\nP₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2)\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value rounds to approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem includes several pieces of information that are not needed for the calculation. These act as distractors to test the understanding of the underlying physical principles.\n    *   **Planet Masses**: The ratios of the planet masses are irrelevant. Kepler's Third Law, in this form, assumes that the planets' masses are negligible compared to the mass of the star they orbit.\n    *   **TTV Method**: The mention of the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method is also irrelevant to the question asked.\n    *   **Albedo Value**: The specific albedo value of 0.3 is not needed. The only important detail is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows it to be canceled out when creating the proportionality between temperature and orbital distance.\n*   **Inconsistent Candidate Answers**: While most candidate answers perform the calculation correctly, several select the wrong letter for their final answer. This is likely due to inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options across different versions. However, the numerical result of ~33.4 is consistently derived in the correct solutions.\n\nBased on the calculation, the factor is ~33.4, which corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including a list of careful points to consider, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe goal is to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1. This is the ratio P₃ / P₁.\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star, its albedo (A), and its distance from the star (a). The relationship is T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a².\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the relationship simplifies to:\n    T_eq⁴ ∝ 1 / a²\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides gives:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    This means the ratio of orbital distances is the inverse square of the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)²\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period:**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). For the circular orbits mentioned, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance.\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This means the ratio of orbital periods is related to the ratio of orbital distances as follows:\n    P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a₃ / a₁):**\n    We are given the temperature ratios and can use the relationship from Step 1.\n    *   First, find the ratio for Planet 2 to Planet 1:\n        a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n    *   Next, find the ratio for Planet 3 to Planet 2:\n        a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n    *   To find the total ratio a₃ / a₁, multiply the intermediate ratios:\n        a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods (P₃ / P₁):**\n    Using the result from Step 3 and the relationship from Step 2:\n    P₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n    P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated value is approximately 33.4. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~ 33.4\n    *   B) ~ 10.4\n    *   C) ~ 3.2\n    *   D) ~ 4.4\n\n    The result matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem includes several pieces of information that are not needed for the calculation. This is a common technique in physics problems to test understanding of the underlying principles.\n    *   **Planet Masses:** The ratios of the masses are irrelevant. Kepler's Third Law in its simple form (P² ∝ a³) is a very accurate approximation when the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard assumption.\n    *   **TTV Method:** The mention of the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method, which detects gravitational influences between planets, might suggest that the masses are significant. However, for calculating the fundamental period ratios, these effects are considered perturbations on the main orbit defined by the star's gravity. The core relationship from Kepler's Law still holds.\n    *   **Albedo Value:** The specific albedo value of 0.3 is not needed. The crucial information is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows it to be canceled out when forming the temperature ratios.\n*   **Consistency of Logic:** As shown in the analysis of the candidate answers, there are two valid logical paths to the solution: a two-step method involving the orbital distance `a`, or a direct method relating period to temperature (P ∝ T_eq⁻³). Both yield the same numerical result.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** A significant number of the provided candidate answers perform the calculation correctly but fail to select the corresponding option letter.
