To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA) C6H12O2\nB) C6H10O2\nC) C6H10O\nD) C6H12O\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is a result of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum provides definitive confirmation of the alkene functional group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺ (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### **4. Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques leads to a clear conclusion: the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on these two structural requirements:\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Two Oxygen Atoms.** The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecular formula must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n\n*   **C) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C bond confirmed by the spectra. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence: it contains two oxygen atoms to form a carboxylic acid, and it has two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (very broad):** All analyses correctly identify this as the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding, which is a key feature distinguishing it from a typical alcohol O-H stretch (which is usually less broad and centered at a higher wavenumber, ~3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is correctly identified as a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is correctly identified as a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The presence of these signals confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n*   **Fragment at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic peak. The mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺, is 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Elimination**\n*   The combined evidence from all three techniques points unequivocally to a molecule that contains both a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n*   A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This fact immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n*   The remaining possibilities are C) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2.\n\n**5. Final Differentiation using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The identified functional groups require a specific DoU:\n    *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n*   Now, we calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   **For C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches the required DoU.\n    *   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This only accounts for one double bond (the C=O) and does not allow for the presence of the C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only formula that is consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic evidence (presence of a carboxylic acid, presence of an alkene, and the required two degrees of unsaturation) is C6H10O2. According to the question's options, this corresponds to C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe core of this problem is to interpret the data from three different spectroscopic techniques and combine the findings to deduce the structure's key features.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation explicitly confirms the presence of a **C=C double bond**, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a **carboxylic acid**. It corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; Total = 45).\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Findings\n\nCombining the data from all three techniques leads to a clear conclusion about the functional groups present:\n1.  The compound contains a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  The compound contains an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on the deduced structural features.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Number of Oxygen Atoms**\n    A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, not the additional C=C bond. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the experimental evidence—containing two oxygen atoms and having two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carboxylic acid and alkene functional groups—is **C6H10O2**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point:** The FTIR spectrum provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (very broad):** This is a highly characteristic absorption for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is a result of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The combination of this peak with the very broad O-H stretch is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point:** ¹H NMR provides information about the hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n*   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point:** Mass spectrometry provides information about the molecular weight and fragmentation pattern of the molecule.\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. The observation of a fragment at m/z = 45 is very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\n*   **Summary of Findings:** The combined data from all three techniques strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   **Implications for the Chemical Formula:**\n    1.  The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n    2.  We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2.\n*   **Using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** To differentiate between the remaining options, we calculate the DoU. The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds (double/triple bonds).\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   Our identified functional groups require a specific DoU: one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means the total required DoU is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n*   **Calculating DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches the required DoU.\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This only accounts for one double bond (the C=O of the acid) and does not allow for the C=C bond.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence (presence of a carboxylic acid, an alkene, two oxygen atoms, and a degree of unsaturation of 2) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is the most characteristic feature of an O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.

It corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; Total=45).\n\n### Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options\n\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques points conclusively to a molecule that contains both a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid functional group requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options with only one oxygen: C6H12O and C6H10O.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule. Our compound has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n*   **Final Check:** We must now check the DoU for the remaining two options, which both have two oxygen atoms. The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n    *   **For C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not account for the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **For C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence (presence of a carboxylic acid, an alkene, and a total of two degrees of unsaturation) is **C6H10O2**.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3.

Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Peak 1: Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹.** This is a highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered at a higher wavenumber (3200-3600 cm⁻¹) and is generally less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Peak 2: Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹.** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The combination of this peak with the very broad O-H peak is a definitive indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Peak 3: Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹.** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond.

This fragment is a very common and stable ion formed from carboxylic acids, providing strong confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n**4. Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Options**\n\nBased on the combined analysis, we have established two key structural features:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  An **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the given options based on these findings.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Atom Count.** A carboxylic acid group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This fact immediately eliminates options B (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), as they only contain one oxygen atom. We are left with A (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU is a count of the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. We can calculate the required DoU from our identified functional groups and compare it to the DoU calculated from the molecular formulas.\n    *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Calculating DoU for the Remaining Options.** The formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   For option **A) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n    *   For option **C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.

It does not allow for the additional C=C bond confirmed by the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of two oxygen atoms, a C=O bond, and a C=C bond—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1.

The mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺, is calculated as 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. This fragment is a very common and stable ion formed from carboxylic acids, providing strong, independent confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n### **Step 2: Synthesize the Findings**\n\nThe combined evidence from all three analytical techniques points conclusively to the unknown compound being an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must contain:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.

This allows us to immediately eliminate options with only one oxygen.\n    *   C) C6H10O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n    *   D) C6H12O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n    This leaves us with options A) C6H12O2 and B) C6H10O2.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. We can calculate the DoU required by our identified functional groups and compare it to the DoU of the remaining formulas.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the alkene accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.

Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is a result of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum provides definitive confirmation of the alkene functional group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺ (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### **4. Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques leads to a clear conclusion: the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on these two structural requirements:\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Two Oxygen Atoms.** The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecular formula must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n\n*   **C) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C bond confirmed by the spectra. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence: it contains two oxygen atoms to form a carboxylic acid, and it has two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (very broad):** All analyses correctly identify this as the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding, which is a key feature distinguishing it from a typical alcohol O-H stretch (which is usually less broad and centered at a higher wavenumber, ~3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is correctly identified as a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is correctly identified as a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The presence of these signals confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n*   **Fragment at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic peak. The mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺, is 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Elimination**\n*   The combined evidence from all three techniques points unequivocally to a molecule that contains both a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n*   A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This fact immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n*   The remaining possibilities are C) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2.\n\n**5. Final Differentiation using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The identified functional groups require a specific DoU:\n    *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n*   Now, we calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   **For C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches the required DoU.\n    *   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This only accounts for one double bond (the C=O) and does not allow for the presence of the C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only formula that is consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic evidence (presence of a carboxylic acid, presence of an alkene, and the required two degrees of unsaturation) is C6H10O2. According to the question's options, this corresponds to C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe core of this problem is to interpret the data from three different spectroscopic techniques and combine the findings to deduce the structure's key features.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.

It corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; Total = 45).\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Findings\n\nCombining the data from all three techniques leads to a clear conclusion about the functional groups present:\n1.  The compound contains a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  The compound contains an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on the deduced structural features.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Number of Oxygen Atoms**\n    A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, not the additional C=C bond. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the experimental evidence—containing two oxygen atoms and having two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carboxylic acid and alkene functional groups—is **C6H10O2**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point:** The FTIR spectrum provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (very broad):** This is a highly characteristic absorption for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is a result of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The combination of this peak with the very broad O-H stretch is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point:** ¹H NMR provides information about the hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n*   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point:** Mass spectrometry provides information about the molecular weight and fragmentation pattern of the molecule.\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. The observation of a fragment at m/z = 45 is very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4.

The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n    2.  We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2.\n*   **Using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** To differentiate between the remaining options, we calculate the DoU. The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds (double/triple bonds).\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   Our identified functional groups require a specific DoU: one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means the total required DoU is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n*   **Calculating DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches the required DoU.\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.

It corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; Total=45).\n\n### Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options\n\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques points conclusively to a molecule that contains both a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid functional group requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options with only one oxygen: C6H12O and C6H10O.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule. Our compound has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n*   **Final Check:** We must now check the DoU for the remaining two options, which both have two oxygen atoms. The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n    *   **For C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid.

The combination of this peak with the broad O-H peak is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for \"vinyl-hydrogens\" directly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, as these are protons attached to the carbons of the double bond. This supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n### Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options\n\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques points conclusively to the unknown compound being an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecular formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a crucial calculation to distinguish the remaining options. It represents the total number of rings and pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   The identified functional groups require a specific DoU: one C=O double bond (from the acid) contributes 1 DoU, and one C=C double bond (from the alkene) contributes another 1 DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation is **2**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Final Two Options:**\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms and the correct DoU of 2. It is consistent with all the data.\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has two oxygen atoms but only has a DoU of 1. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot have the additional C=C double bond confirmed by the FTIR and NMR spectra.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only chemical formula that satisfies all the requirements from the spectroscopic data—containing two oxygen atoms and having two degrees of unsaturation to account for both a carboxylic acid and an alkene group—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, along with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the existence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, containing both a -COOH group and a C=C group.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum provides direct confirmation of the alkene functional group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is calculated as 12 (for Carbon) + 16 (for Oxygen) + 16 (for Oxygen) + 1 (for Hydrogen) = 45. This fragment provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **4. Synthesis of All Data**\nThe combined evidence from all three analytical techniques points conclusively to the unknown compound being an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **5. Evaluation of the Chemical Formula Options**\nBased on the conclusion that the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, we can evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Two Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options **A) C6H12O** and **C) C6H10O**, as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The carboxylic acid's C=O double bond accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The alkene's C=C double bond accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n\n*   **For B) C6H12O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    This DoU of 1 is insufficient, as it only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid and does not allow for the C=C bond confirmed by the spectra.\n\n*   **For D) C6H10O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid group (two oxygens), an alkene group, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation of 2—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Peak 1: Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹.** This is a highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered at a higher wavenumber (3200-3600 cm⁻¹) and is generally less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Peak 2: Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹.** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The combination of this peak with the very broad O-H peak is a definitive indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Peak 3: Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹.** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their confirmed presence in the spectrum corroborates the FTIR data and proves the existence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺, is calculated as 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. This fragment is a very common and stable ion formed from carboxylic acids, providing strong confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n**4. Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Options**\n\nBased on the combined analysis, we have established two key structural features:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  An **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the given options based on these findings.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Atom Count.** A carboxylic acid group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This fact immediately eliminates options B (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), as they only contain one oxygen atom. We are left with A (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU is a count of the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. We can calculate the required DoU from our identified functional groups and compare it to the DoU calculated from the molecular formulas.\n    *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Calculating DoU for the Remaining Options.** The formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   For option **A) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n    *   For option **C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C bond confirmed by the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of two oxygen atoms, a C=O bond, and a C=C bond—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this peak with the very broad O-H peak is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n*   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺, is calculated as: 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. This fragment is a very common and stable ion formed from carboxylic acids, strongly confirming the presence of the -COOH group.\n\n**4. Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\nFrom the combined spectroscopic data, we have established that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it must contain:\n*   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has **two oxygen atoms**.\n*   An alkene group (C=C).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these requirements:\n*   Options A (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O) can be eliminated immediately because they only contain one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   We are left with options B (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n\n**5. Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) contributes 1 to the DoU.\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) contributes 1 to the DoU.\n*   Therefore, the molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n*   **For B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   A DoU of 1 is not enough to account for both a C=C and a C=O bond. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid. This is incorrect.\n*   **For D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   A DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence: the presence of a carboxylic acid group (two oxygens), an alkene group, and the required degree of unsaturation of 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe consensus among the provided answers is that the spectroscopic data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n1.  **Functional Groups:** The FTIR data (broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹) and the Mass Spec fragment (m/z = 45) are definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the vinyl hydrogens in the ¹H NMR confirm a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n2.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms, eliminating options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The structure must have at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond).\n4.  **Formula Check:**\n    *   C6H12O2 (Option C) has a DoU of 1, which is insufficient.\n    *   C6H10O2 (Option B) has a DoU of 2, which perfectly matches the evidence.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is a result of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When observed in conjunction with the very broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their observation in the spectrum confirms the presence of an alkene, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment.

This fragment is a very common and stable ion formed from carboxylic acids, strongly confirming the presence of the -COOH group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options**\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence establishes that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means the molecule must satisfy two key conditions:\n1.  It must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  It must contain both a C=O double bond and a C=C double bond, requiring a total **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these two conditions:\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:** Incorrect. It only has one oxygen atom.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** Incorrect. It has two oxygen atoms, but its Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1`. This only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid, not the additional C=C bond.\n*   **C) C6H10O:** Incorrect. It only has one oxygen atom.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** Correct. It has two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid. Its Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2`. This perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid, an alkene group, and the corresponding requirement of two degrees of unsaturation—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the execution of the code, the final result is determined by systematically evaluating each candidate formula against the criteria derived from the spectroscopic data.\n\nThe analysis of the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data indicates that the unknown compound must be an unsaturated carboxylic acid.

A **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2** to account for both the carbonyl double bond (C=O) and the alkene double bond (C=C).\n\nThe code evaluated the four options:\n*   **C6H10O (A):** Fails because it only has one oxygen atom.\n*   **C6H10O2 (B):** Passes, having two oxygen atoms and a DoU of 2.\n*   **C6H12O (C):** Fails, having only one oxygen atom and a DoU of 1.\n*   **C6H12O2 (D):** Fails, having a DoU of only 1, which cannot account for both the C=O and C=C bonds.\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the experimental evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe core of the problem is to interpret the three pieces of spectroscopic data to deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its presence alongside the broad O-H peak confirms the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), meaning the compound is an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation directly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Findings\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques consistently points to the unknown compound being an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must contain:\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An alkene group (C=C).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on our deductions.\n\n*   **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options with only one oxygen:\n    *   B) C6H10O\n    *   D) C6H12O\n    This leaves us with A) C6H10O2 and C) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU calculates the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n    *   Our compound has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene).\n    *   Therefore, the required DoU is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches our requirement.\n    *   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.
