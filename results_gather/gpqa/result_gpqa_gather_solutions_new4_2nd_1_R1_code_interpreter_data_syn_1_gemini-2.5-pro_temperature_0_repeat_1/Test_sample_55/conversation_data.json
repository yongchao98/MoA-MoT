Understand the Physical Process**\nThe question describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole transition. This is a cascade emission process where two photons are emitted sequentially.\n\n**2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions**\nFor a transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the following conditions must be met:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$ (as $l'$ cannot be negative).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease ($n'<3$). The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$, so $n'=2, l'=1$.\n*   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. For any of the possible intermediate states ($m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$), the resulting $\\Delta m$ is allowed ($\\Delta m \\in \\{+1, 0, -1\\}$).\n*   **Conclusion:** All three potential pathways are physically allowed by the selection rules.\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n*   **Probability of the first step ($P_1$):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the probability of transitioning to each of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state is equal. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any specific one is $P_1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Probability of the second step ($P_2$):** Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which only has an $l=0$ subshell. Therefore, the only possible E1 decay is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. This means the probability of this second step is $P_2 = 1$.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific routes is $P_{total} = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options**\nWe now compare our findings with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

Such processes are governed by the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The key rules are that the orbital angular momentum quantum number (*l*) must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1), and the magnetic quantum number (*m*) must change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1). For a decay, the principal quantum number (*n*) must decrease.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State**\n    *   The initial state is |*n*,*l*,*m*⟩ = |3,0,0⟩.\n    *   Applying the Δ*l* = ±1 rule: Since the initial state has *l*=0, the intermediate state must have *l'*=1.\n    *   Applying the Δ*m* = 0, ±1 rule: Since the initial state has *m*=0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, and the options suggest the intermediate state has *n'*=2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0⟩**\n    *   The intermediate states are |2,1,*m'*⟩ and the final state is |1,0,0⟩.\n    *   Applying the Δ*l* = ±1 rule: The change is from *l'*=1 to *l*''=0, so Δ*l* = -1. This is allowed.\n    *   Applying the Δ*m* = 0, ±1 rule: The change is from *m'* ∈ {-1, 0, 1} to *m*''=0. This is allowed for all three intermediate states (Δ*m* = +1, 0, or -1).\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three potential decay routes are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n    *   The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1:** The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an *s*-orbital, which is spherically symmetric.\n        *   **Careful Point:** Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩).\n        *   Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for the decay to proceed through any single one of them is 1/3.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,*m'*⟩ states, the only possible E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state.\n        *   **Careful Point:** Because this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this second step occurring is 1.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: P(route) = P(step 1) × P(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The analysis shows that any of the three possible routes has a probability of 1/3.\n    *   Route via |2,1,-1⟩: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via |2,1,0⟩: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via |2,1,1⟩: Probability = 1/3\n\n    Now, let's evaluate the options given in the prompt:\n    A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3.

The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole transition. This is a cascade decay process, meaning it proceeds through an intermediate state.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n,l,m\\rangle$:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The principal quantum number $n$ must decrease for spontaneous emission ($\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Possible Intermediate States\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   We must check if a transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   The change in orbital angular momentum is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$ is allowed for all possible $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Conclusion: All three routes through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are physically possible.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible lower-energy state it can decay to via a dipole transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Probability of the first step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three possible (and degenerate) intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single specific path is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe total probability for any of the three possible routes is therefore $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options\nLet's compare our findings with the options provided in the question:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is malformed, and the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only one that provides a valid transition route with the correct probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\nThe question describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ (the 3s state) to the final state |1,0,0⟩ (the 1s ground state). Each step is an electric dipole transition. We need to identify a valid decay path and its probability.\n\n**2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules**\nThe rules governing which transitions are allowed are:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by zero or one.\n*   For decay, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State**\n*   **Initial State:** |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩.\n*   **Intermediate State |n', l', m'⟩:**\n    *   **l'**: Since the initial state has l=0, the selection rule Δl = ±1 requires the intermediate state to have **l' = 1**.\n    *   **n'**: The energy must decrease, so n' < 3. The decay must eventually reach n=1, so the intermediate state must have n' > 1. This leaves **n' = 2**.\n    *   **m'**: Since the initial state has m=0, the selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the intermediate state to have **m' = -1, 0, or +1**.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. These are the three states of the 2p subshell.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0⟩**\n*   **Intermediate State:** |2,1,m'⟩ where m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.\n*   **Final State:** |1,0,0⟩.\n*   **Check Selection Rules:**\n    *   **Δl**: The change is from l'=1 to l=0, so Δl = -1. This is allowed.\n    *   **Δm**: The change is from m' to m=0. For m'=-1, Δm=+1. For m'=0, Δm=0. For m'=1, Δm=-1. All these are allowed.\n*   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0⟩. Therefore, there are three valid decay routes.\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, the only possible lower energy level it can decay to via a dipole transition is the |1,0,0⟩ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred direction in space. Consequently, when it decays, it is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the 2p state (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩).\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single one of them is **1/3**.\n\n**6. Determine the Final Answer**\nThe total probability for any of the three possible cascade routes is the probability of the first step (1/3) multiplied by the probability of the second step (1), which equals **1/3**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4.

The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole transition. This is a cascade decay process, meaning it proceeds through an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules that determine whether a transition between two states is \"allowed\". For a transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the rules are:\n*   **Δl = l' - l = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one.\n*   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one.\n*   **Δn**: The principal quantum number *n* must change, and for a decay (spontaneous emission), it must decrease ($n' < n$).\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Two Transitions\n\n**Step 1: First Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Applying Δn < 0:** The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$, which is a valid decay ($n'=2 < n=3$).\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Second Transition from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the Final State $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1:** The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible values of $m'$ (if $m'=-1, \\Delta m=+1$; if $m'=0, \\Delta m=0$; if $m'=1, \\Delta m=-1$).\n*   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, there are three valid decay routes.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that path.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s*-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred direction in space.\n*   When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, it populates each of the possible magnetic sublevels of the final state with equal probability. This is a fundamental consequence of rotational symmetry in quantum mechanics (and can be formally shown with the Wigner-Eckart theorem).\n*   Since there are three possible, equally likely intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$), the probability of the atom decaying into any *single one* of them is **1/3**.\n*   Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via a dipole transition (as it's the only available lower energy state that satisfies the selection rules). Therefore, the probability of the second step is 1.\n*   The total probability for any of the three complete routes is the product of the probabilities of the steps: $P_{route} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\nNow we compare our findings with the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be 1/3.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be 1/3.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The route description is incomplete, and the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C is the only one that provides a valid transition route with the correct probability.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state). This decay happens via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This is known as a cascade decay.\n\n**2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions**\nFor a transition from an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the following conditions must be met:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Two-Step Decay Path**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$. The decay path is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$**\n    *   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l_i = 1$.\n    *   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m_i = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   **Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest an intermediate state with $n_i=2$, which is a valid decay step ($n_i=2 < n=3$).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   **Intermediate state:** $n_i=2, l_i=1, m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Final state:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0 - m_i$. This is allowed for all possible values of $m_i$ (giving $\\Delta m = +1, 0, -1$).\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, all three cascade routes are physically possible.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This is the branching ratio for that particular decay path.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   In the absence of external fields, the decay must be isotropic.

Understand the Physical Process**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay happens in two steps, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This is a cascade decay process involving an intermediate state.\n\n**2. Recall the Electric Dipole Selection Rules**\nFor a transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the electric dipole interaction, the following selection rules must be met:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease, $n' < n$.\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow$ Intermediate State**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$ (as $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$ and $l'$ must be non-negative).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$ (as $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease. Since this is a two-step process to reach $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State $\\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\nWe must check if a transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate values of $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** All three possible decay routes are physically allowed by the selection rules.\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This is the branching ratio for that path.\n*   The probability of the entire cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step: $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$.\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The probability of the entire route is thus determined by the branching ratio of the first step: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   In the absence of external fields, the decay must be isotropic. This implies that the probability of transitioning to each of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $l'=1$ state must be equal.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first decay step, the probability for any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**6.

Such processes are governed by the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions. The key rules are:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow$ Intermediate State**\n    *   The initial state is $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule to the initial state with $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule to the initial state with $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, and the options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State $\\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state is $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's check if a transition from the intermediate states (with $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) is allowed. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the selection rule.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$, is also allowed for all possible $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Conclusion: All three potential decay routes are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** This is the crucial part. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s*-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, it does so isotropically, meaning it is equally likely to transition into any of the available, degenerate final states. The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any one of these specific states is equal.

Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom, specifically a cascade from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition, which is governed by a set of selection rules.\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number, $n$, must decrease.\n\n### 2. Analyze the First Transition Step\nThe atom starts in the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** The initial state has $l=0$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l_k = 1$ (since $l_k - 0 = \\pm 1$ and $l$ cannot be negative).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** The initial state has $m=0$. Therefore, the intermediate state can have $m_k = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$ (since $m_k - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n_k < 3$. The problem specifies a two-step decay to $n=1$, and the options all point to an intermediate state with $n_k=2$.\n\nCombining these rules, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Second Transition Step\nThe atom then decays from the intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** The intermediate state has $l_k=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the rule.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** The final state has $m_f=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m_k$. Since $m_k$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$, the resulting $\\Delta m$ can be $+1, 0, \\text{ or } -1$. This also satisfies the rule.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are physically allowed.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes for this first decay step, the probability (or branching ratio) for any specific one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which only contains the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. The transition from $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the selection rules. Since this is the only possible E1 decay channel, the probability of this second step occurring is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability of a Specific Route:**\n    The total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n    $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    The same probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ applies to the other two routes as well.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nWe must now compare this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.

The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nTherefore, option D is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom in the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ decaying to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole transitions, meaning it's a two-step process involving an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a strict set of selection rules for the quantum numbers of the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and the final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:\n*   **Rule for l:** The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one: $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Rule for m:** The magnetic quantum number must change by zero or one: $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Rule for n:** The principal quantum number must decrease for spontaneous emission (decay), so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition\nThe atom starts in the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state, which the options suggest is a $|2,l',m'\\rangle$ state.\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$ to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$ to satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition\nThe atom then decays from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, so $n'=2, l'=1$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** The change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** The change is $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate values of $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** All three decay routes through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible decay channel via a single electric dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** The problem reduces to finding the probability of the atom taking one specific path out of the three possible paths in the first transition. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n\nSince there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability of the atom decaying into any single specific intermediate state is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three complete routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 6. Evaluate the Options\nNow we compare our findings with the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid transition route and the correctly calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The route is incomplete, and the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is fully correct is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script successfully analyzed the provided options for the two-step dipole decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state.\n\nThe analysis was performed in two main parts:\n1.  **Path Validation**: The script checked if each step in the proposed decay path was valid according to the electric dipole selection rules (Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1). It found that the paths in options A, B, and C were valid, while the path in option D was invalid due to a malformed initial state.\n2.  **Probability Validation**: The script calculated the correct probability for any valid decay route. Based on the spherical symmetry of the initial |3,0,0⟩ state, the decay probability is distributed equally among the three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩). This results in a probability of 1/3 for each of the three valid decay routes.\n\nThe script then compared its findings with the given options and concluded that only option B presented both a valid decay path and the correct probability of 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole transition. This is a cascade decay process involving an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions\nFor a transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the following conditions must be met:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease ($n' < n$).\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition: Initial State to Intermediate State\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n'<3$. The problem implies a cascade through the $n=2$ level, which is the most common decay path. So, we set $n'=2$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State to Final State\n*   **Intermediate States:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=1, l=0, m=0$).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For all possible values of $m'$, this results in an allowed change ($\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n*   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, there are three valid decay routes.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single one is **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which only has the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. The transition to this state is allowed by the selection rules. Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability of a Single Route:**\n    The total probability for any one of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{route} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 6.

It should be 1/3.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    This is a valid route, but the probability is incorrect. It should be 1/3.\n\n*   **D) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    This route is malformed but likely refers to the same path as in A. The probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A is correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole transition. We need to identify a valid decay path and its corresponding probability.\n\n### 2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions\nFor a transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers of the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and the final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must satisfy the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$, where $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Rule for l**: Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$ (because $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$ and $l'$ must be non-negative).\n*   **Rule for m**: Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$ (because $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$).\n*   **Rule for n**: The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\nNow, let's check if a transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Rule for l**: The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n*   **Rule for m**: The final state has $m=0$. A transition from any of the intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) to $m=0$ is allowed, as the change $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$ would be $+1, 0, \\text{ or } -1$.\n\nTherefore, all three possible routes through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are physically valid.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n*   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred direction in space. Consequently, when it decays, it is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for any specific one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**: Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible decay channel to a lower energy level via an electric dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 6.

In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the probability of transitioning to each of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state is equal. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any specific one is $P_1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Probability of the second step ($P_2$):** Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which only has an $l=0$ subshell. Therefore, the only possible E1 decay is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. This means the probability of this second step is $P_2 = 1$.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific routes is $P_{total} = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**6.

Each step is an electric dipole transition. This is a cascade decay process, meaning it proceeds through an intermediate state.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n,l,m\\rangle$:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The principal quantum number $n$ must decrease for spontaneous emission ($\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Possible Intermediate States\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   We must check if a transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   The change in orbital angular momentum is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$ is allowed for all possible $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Conclusion: All three routes through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are physically possible.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible lower-energy state it can decay to via a dipole transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Probability of the first step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three possible (and degenerate) intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single specific path is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe total probability for any of the three possible routes is therefore $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options\nLet's compare our findings with the options provided in the question:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.

The route is malformed, and the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only one that provides a valid transition route with the correct probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n**1.

Each step is an electric dipole transition. We need to identify a valid decay path and its probability.\n\n**2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules**\nThe rules governing which transitions are allowed are:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by zero or one.\n*   For decay, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n**3.

The decay must eventually reach n=1, so the intermediate state must have n' > 1. This leaves **n' = 2**.\n    *   **m'**: Since the initial state has m=0, the selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the intermediate state to have **m' = -1, 0, or +1**.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. These are the three states of the 2p subshell.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0⟩**\n*   **Intermediate State:** |2,1,m'⟩ where m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.\n*   **Final State:** |1,0,0⟩.\n*   **Check Selection Rules:**\n    *   **Δl**: The change is from l'=1 to l=0, so Δl = -1. This is allowed.\n    *   **Δm**: The change is from m' to m=0. For m'=-1, Δm=+1. For m'=0, Δm=0. For m'=1, Δm=-1. All these are allowed.\n*   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0⟩. Therefore, there are three valid decay routes.\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, the only possible lower energy level it can decay to via a dipole transition is the |1,0,0⟩ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred direction in space. Consequently, when it decays, it is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the 2p state (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩).\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single one of them is **1/3**.\n\n**6. Determine the Final Answer**\nThe total probability for any of the three possible cascade routes is the probability of the first step (1/3) multiplied by the probability of the second step (1), which equals **1/3**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4.

Understanding the Physical Process\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole transition. This is a cascade decay process, meaning it proceeds through an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Applying Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules that determine whether a transition between two states is \"allowed\". For a transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the rules are:\n*   **Δl = l' - l = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one.\n*   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one.\n*   **Δn**: The principal quantum number *n* must change, and for a decay (spontaneous emission), it must decrease ($n' < n$).\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Two Transitions\n\n**Step 1: First Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Applying Δn < 0:** The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$, which is a valid decay ($n'=2 < n=3$).\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Second Transition from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the Final State $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1:** The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible values of $m'$ (if $m'=-1, \\Delta m=+1$; if $m'=0, \\Delta m=0$; if $m'=1, \\Delta m=-1$).\n*   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, there are three valid decay routes.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that path.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s*-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred direction in space.\n*   When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, it populates each of the possible magnetic sublevels of the final state with equal probability. This is a fundamental consequence of rotational symmetry in quantum mechanics (and can be formally shown with the Wigner-Eckart theorem).\n*   Since there are three possible, equally likely intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$), the probability of the atom decaying into any *single one* of them is **1/3**.\n*   Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via a dipole transition (as it's the only available lower energy state that satisfies the selection rules). Therefore, the probability of the second step is 1.\n*   The total probability for any of the three complete routes is the product of the probabilities of the steps: $P_{route} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\nNow we compare our findings with the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.

This decay happens via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This is known as a cascade decay.\n\n**2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions**\nFor a transition from an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the following conditions must be met:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Two-Step Decay Path**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$. The decay path is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$**\n    *   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l_i = 1$.\n    *   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m_i = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   **Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest an intermediate state with $n_i=2$, which is a valid decay step ($n_i=2 < n=3$).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   **Intermediate state:** $n_i=2, l_i=1, m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Final state:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0 - m_i$. This is allowed for all possible values of $m_i$ (giving $\\Delta m = +1, 0, -1$).\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, all three cascade routes are physically possible.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This is the branching ratio for that particular decay path.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   In the absence of external fields, the decay must be isotropic. This implies that the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first decay step, the probability of the atom decaying into any *one* specific intermediate state is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   For the second step, once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ states, the only possible E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.

This decay happens in two steps, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This is a cascade decay process involving an intermediate state.\n\n**2. Recall the Electric Dipole Selection Rules**\nFor a transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the electric dipole interaction, the following selection rules must be met:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease, $n' < n$.\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow$ Intermediate State**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$ (as $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$ and $l'$ must be non-negative).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$ (as $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease. Since this is a two-step process to reach $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State $\\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\nWe must check if a transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate values of $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** All three possible decay routes are physically allowed by the selection rules.\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This is the branching ratio for that path.\n*   The probability of the entire cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step: $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$.\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The probability of the entire route is thus determined by the branching ratio of the first step: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   In the absence of external fields, the decay must be isotropic. This implies that the probability of transitioning to each of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $l'=1$ state must be equal.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first decay step, the probability for any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options**\nBased on our analysis, any of the three possible routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNow, let's compare this with the given choices:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

Such processes are governed by the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions. The key rules are:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow$ Intermediate State**\n    *   The initial state is $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule to the initial state with $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule to the initial state with $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, and the options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State $\\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state is $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's check if a transition from the intermediate states (with $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) is allowed. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the selection rule.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$, is also allowed for all possible $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Conclusion: All three potential decay routes are physically valid according to the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** This is the crucial part. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s*-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. When it decays, it does so isotropically, meaning it is equally likely to transition into any of the available, degenerate final states. The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any one of these specific states is equal. Since there are three such states, the probability for each is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion and Comparison with Options**\n    The total probability for any of the three valid routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    Let's evaluate the given options:\n    *   A) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.

(Correct route and correct probability)\n\nOnly option D presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom, specifically a cascade from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition, which is governed by a set of selection rules.\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number, $n$, must decrease.\n\n### 2. Analyze the First Transition Step\nThe atom starts in the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** The initial state has $l=0$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l_k = 1$ (since $l_k - 0 = \\pm 1$ and $l$ cannot be negative).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** The initial state has $m=0$. Therefore, the intermediate state can have $m_k = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$ (since $m_k - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n_k < 3$. The problem specifies a two-step decay to $n=1$, and the options all point to an intermediate state with $n_k=2$.\n\nCombining these rules, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Second Transition Step\nThe atom then decays from the intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** The intermediate state has $l_k=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the rule.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** The final state has $m_f=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m_k$. Since $m_k$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$, the resulting $\\Delta m$ can be $+1, 0, \\text{ or } -1$. This also satisfies the rule.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are physically allowed.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes for this first decay step, the probability (or branching ratio) for any specific one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which only contains the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. The transition from $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the selection rules. Since this is the only possible E1 decay channel, the probability of this second step occurring is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability of a Specific Route:**\n    The total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n    $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    The same probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ applies to the other two routes as well.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nWe must now compare this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid (assuming a typo), but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

Analyze the First Transition\nThe atom starts in the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** The initial state has $l=0$.

The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** The transition is from $m'$ (which can be -1, 0, or 1) to $m_f=0$. In all three cases, the change $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$ is either $0$ or $\\pm 1$, which is allowed.\n\nThis confirms that all three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 4.

In the absence of external fields, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for any specific one is **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it can only decay to a lower energy level. The only available lower level is $n=1$, which only has an $l=0$ subshell. The transition from $l=1$ to $l=0$ is allowed. Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this step occurring is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability of a Specific Route:**\n    The total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5.

Understand the Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole transition. These transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n, l, m\\rangle$:\n*   **Rule for l (Orbital Angular Momentum):** The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Rule for m (Magnetic Quantum Number):** The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Rule for n (Principal Quantum Number):** For a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n**2. Analyze the First Transition Step**\n\nThe atom starts in the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial State:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$ (because $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, and $l'$ cannot be negative).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$ (because $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$, which is a valid decay ($2 < 3$).\n*   **Conclusion for the intermediate state:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Transition Step**\n\nThe atom then decays from the intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Intermediate State:** $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final State:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. For all possible intermediate values of $m'$ (i.e., -1, 0, 1), the resulting $\\Delta m$ (+1, 0, -1) is allowed.\n*   **Conclusion for the second step:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This is the branching ratio for that particular decay path.\n*   **Probability of the first step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. The three possible final states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy. Due to the symmetry of the initial state, the probability of decaying into any of these three substates is equal. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any specific one is **1/3**.\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only possible decay via a single dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step occurring is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5.

(Note: The initial state is missing in the option's text but is implied).\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nTherefore, option D is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom in the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ decaying to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole transitions, meaning it's a two-step process involving an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a strict set of selection rules for the quantum numbers of the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and the final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:\n*   **Rule for l:** The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one: $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Rule for m:** The magnetic quantum number must change by zero or one: $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Rule for n:** The principal quantum number must decrease for spontaneous emission (decay), so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition\nThe atom starts in the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state, which the options suggest is a $|2,l',m'\\rangle$ state.\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$ to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$ to satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition\nThe atom then decays from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Intermediate State:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, so $n'=2, l'=1$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** The change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** The change is $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate values of $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** All three decay routes through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible decay channel via a single electric dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** The problem reduces to finding the probability of the atom taking one specific path out of the three possible paths in the first transition. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n\nSince there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability of the atom decaying into any single specific intermediate state is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three complete routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 6. Evaluate the Options\nNow we compare our findings with the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid transition route and the correctly calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The route is incomplete, and the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is fully correct is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script successfully analyzed the provided options for the two-step dipole decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state.\n\nThe analysis was performed in two main parts:\n1.  **Path Validation**: The script checked if each step in the proposed decay path was valid according to the electric dipole selection rules (Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1). It found that the paths in options A, B, and C were valid, while the path in option D was invalid due to a malformed initial state.\n2.  **Probability Validation**: The script calculated the correct probability for any valid decay route. Based on the spherical symmetry of the initial |3,0,0⟩ state, the decay probability is distributed equally among the three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩). This results in a probability of 1/3 for each of the three valid decay routes.\n\nThe script then compared its findings with the given options and concluded that only option B presented both a valid decay path and the correct probability of 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole transition. This is a cascade decay process involving an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions\nFor a transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the following conditions must be met:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease ($n' < n$).\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition: Initial State to Intermediate State\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n'<3$. The problem implies a cascade through the $n=2$ level, which is the most common decay path. So, we set $n'=2$.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State to Final State\n*   **Intermediate States:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=1, l=0, m=0$).\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule:** The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For all possible values of $m'$, this results in an allowed change ($\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n*   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, there are three valid decay routes.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three possible magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single one is **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which only has the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. The transition to this state is allowed by the selection rules. Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability of a Single Route:**\n    The total probability for any one of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{route} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 6. Evaluate the Given Options\nNow, we compare our findings with the options provided:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    This option presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    This is a valid route, but the probability is incorrect. It should be 1/3.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    This is a valid route, but the probability is incorrect. It should be 1/3.\n\n*   **D) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    This route is malformed but likely refers to the same path as in A. The probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A is correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\nThe question describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole transition. We need to identify a valid decay path and its corresponding probability.\n\n### 2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions\nFor a transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers of the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and the final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must satisfy the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$, where $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Rule for l**: Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$ (because $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$ and $l'$ must be non-negative).\n*   **Rule for m**: Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$ (because $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$).\n*   **Rule for n**: The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\nNow, let's check if a transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Rule for l**: The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n*   **Rule for m**: The final state has $m=0$. A transition from any of the intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) to $m=0$ is allowed, as the change $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$ would be $+1, 0, \\text{ or } -1$.\n\nTherefore, all three possible routes through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are physically valid.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n*   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred direction in space. Consequently, when it decays, it is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for any specific one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**: Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible decay channel to a lower energy level via an electric dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 6. Evaluate the Given Options\nLet's compare our findings with the options provided in the question:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid physical process with the correctly calculated probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
