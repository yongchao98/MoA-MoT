Identify the Parent Compound and Substituents\n\n*   **Parent Compound:** The molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC rules, this is the principal functional group, and the parent name is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO) is named as a **formyl** group.\n    *   Cyano (-CN) is named as a **cyano** group.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH) is named as a **hydroxy** group.\n    *   Dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂) is named as a **(dimethylamino)** group.\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃) is named as a **methoxy** group.\n\n### 2. Draw the Structure Based on Positional Information\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring, starting with the principal functional group at C1.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH (This defines the parent benzoic acid).\n\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three groups to be mutually meta, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n*   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4. So, the **methoxy group is at C4**.\n\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6.\n\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   This is the key constraint to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to it, meaning the cyano group must be at C3 or C5. The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (ortho), which is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at C2 (ortho).\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to C1 (which is C6) must be occupied by the dimethylamino group.\n    *   And the remaining meta position (C5) must be occupied by the formyl group.\n    *   This gives **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂.\n\n*   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (ortho), which is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at C6 (ortho).\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to C1 (which is C2) must be occupied by the dimethylamino group.\n    *   And the remaining meta position (C3) must be occupied by the formyl group.\n    *   This gives **Structure II**: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\nBoth structures fully satisfy the description. Fortunately, as we will see, IUPAC rules lead to the same name for both. Let's name Structure I.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n*   **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n*   Numbering starts at C1. We can number clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW).\n*   The set of locants for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for both directions.\n*   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, we number in the direction that gives the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically: **C**yano, **D**imethylamino, **F**ormyl, **H**ydroxy, **M**ethoxy.\n*   Now, let's write the sequence of locants for this alphabetical list for both numbering directions:\n    *   **CW Numbering (2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH₃, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH₃)₂):**\n        *   Cyano is at 3.\n        *   Dimethylamino is at 6.\n        *   Formyl is at 5.\n        *   Hydroxy is at 2.\n        *   Methoxy is at 4.\n        *   The locant sequence is **{3, 6, 5, 2, 4}**.\n    *   **CCW Numbering (2-N(CH₃)₂, 3-CHO, 4-OCH₃, 5-CN, 6-OH):**\n        *   Cyano is at 5.\n        *   Dimethylamino is at 2.\n        *   ...and so on.\n        *   The locant sequence is **{5, 2, 3, 6, 4}**.\n*   We compare the two sequences term by term: {**3**, 6, 5, 2, 4} vs {**5**, 2, 3, 6, 4}. Since 3 is lower than 5, the first sequence is preferred.\n*   Therefore, the **Clockwise (CW) numbering is correct**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing the correct (CW) numbering, the locants are:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nList these alphabetically to construct the final name:\n3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option A. (If we were to name Structure II, the same procedure would also lead to this exact name, as the counter-clockwise direction would be chosen).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound:** The molecule is a substituted benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Map the Substituent Positions:** Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, with the -COOH group at C1.\n\n    *   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at C2 and C6, but we don't yet know which is where.\n    *   **\"a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: This means the carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Resolve Ambiguities:** The final piece of information is: **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"** The methoxy group is fixed at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) can be at C3 or C5.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n        *   The methoxy group at C4 is indeed ortho to C5. This works.\n        *   For the alcohol (hydroxyl group) to also be ortho to C5, it must be at C6.\n        *   This means the -OH is at C6.\n        *   The remaining ortho position (C2) must be occupied by the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   The remaining meta position (C3) must be occupied by the -CHO group.\n        *   This gives **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n        *   The methoxy group at C4 is indeed ortho to C3. This works.\n        *   For the alcohol (hydroxyl group) to also be ortho to C3, it must be at C2.\n        *   This means the -OH is at C2.\n        *   The remaining ortho position (C6) must be occupied by the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   The remaining meta position (C5) must be occupied by the -CHO group.\n        *   This gives **Structure II**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Naming Rules to Both Possible Structures:** The descriptive text is ambiguous and fits two different molecules. We must name both and then apply a tie-breaking rule. The locants for the substituents in both cases are the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant set is identical, IUPAC rules state that we choose the numbering scheme that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   First, let's alphabetize the substituent names:\n        *   **C**yano\n        *   **D**imethylamino\n        *   **F**ormyl (the prefix for -CHO when it's a substituent)\n        *   **H**ydroxy\n        *   **M**ethoxy\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is **Cyano**. We should choose the structure where the cyano group has the lower number.\n\n    *   **Naming Structure I (from Case 1):**\n        *   The cyano group is at **C5**.\n        *   The name is: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. (This matches option D).\n\n    *   **Naming Structure II (from Case 2):**\n        *   The cyano group is at **C3**.\n        *   The name is: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. (This matches option C).\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Name:** According to the IUPAC tie-breaking rule, we must give the lowest locant to the first group in alphabetical order (cyano). Structure II gives the cyano group locant 3, while Structure I gives it locant 5. Since 3 is lower than 5, Structure II and its corresponding name are correct.\n\n    The correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**.\n*   The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned locant number **1**.\n\n**2. Draw the Structure Based on the Positional Information**\n\nLet's place the substituents on the ring starting with C1 = -COOH.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at **C2 and C6** (we don't know which is which yet).\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups must be at **C3 and C5**. This also satisfies the condition that they are meta to each other (C3 and C5 are meta).\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\"**: This is the key constraint to finalize the structure.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group, so the -CN must be at **C3 or C5**.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the -CN group.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group:\n        *   **If -CN is at C3**: Its ortho positions are C2 and C4. We know -OCH3 is at C4. The -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n        *   **If -CN is at C5**: Its ortho positions are C4 and C6. We know -OCH3 is at C4. The -OH group must be at C6. This also works.\n\nIt turns out both possibilities describe valid structures (which are enantiomers of each other). However, they will have the same IUPAC name (without stereochemical descriptors) because the naming rules are unambiguous. Let's pick one of these valid structures to name.\n\nLet's use the structure where: -CN is at C3 and -OH is at C2.\nThis means the remaining groups are: -N(CH3)2 at C6 and -CHO at C5.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n*   **C1**: -COOH\n*   **C2**: -OH\n*   **C3**: -CN\n*   **C4**: -OCH3\n*   **C5**: -CHO\n*   **C6**: -N(CH3)2\n\n**3. Number the Ring According to IUPAC Rules**\n\n*   C1 is fixed. We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants to the substituents.\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Numbering clockwise gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since the locant sets are identical, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The numbering direction that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent that appears first alphabetically is chosen.\n\n**4. Alphabetize the Substituents and Apply the Tie-Breaker**\n\nThe substituents (other than the parent acid) are:\n*   cyano (-CN)\n*   dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) -> alphabetized under 'd'\n*   formyl (-CHO) -> the name for an aldehyde group as a substituent\n*   hydroxy (-OH)\n*   methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nIn alphabetical order, they are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nNow, let's check the locant for the first group in this list (\"cyano\") in both numbering directions:\n*   **Counter-clockwise numbering (as drawn above)**: -OH is at C2, **-CN is at C3**.\n*   **Clockwise numbering**: -N(CH3)2 is at C2, -CHO is at C3, -OCH3 is at C4, **-CN is at C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise direction is correct**. The locants are assigned as we determined in Step 2.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name**\n\n*   **Parent name**: benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents with correct locants**: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n*   **Arrange alphabetically**:\n    *   3-cyano-\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)-\n    *   5-formyl-\n    *   2-hydroxy-\n    *   4-methoxy\n*   **Combine**: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the written description into a chemical structure.\n\n*   **Core:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main Groups:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO, also named as the substituent \"formyl\"), and a cyano group (-CN). They are all *meta* (1,3-position) to one another. This implies a 1,3,5-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   **Assigning Initial Positions:** Let's place the highest priority group, the carboxylic acid (-COOH), at position C1. This makes the parent molecule a benzoic acid. The other two groups, -CHO and -CN, must be at C3 and C5 to satisfy the *meta-to-each-other* condition.\n*   **Placing Other Substituents:**\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2)\". The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3)\". The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n    *   **Crucial Constraint:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\". The nitrile (-CN) is at C5 (we could have placed it at C3, the result would be the same after renumbering).\n        *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. C4 is indeed ortho to C5. This is consistent.\n        *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the -OH group must be at **C6**.\n    *   **Finalizing the Structure:** Since the -OH group is at C6, the other group ortho to the carboxylic acid, the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2), must be at **C2**.\n\nThe final, unambiguous structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (Hydroxy)\n\n### 2. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, functional groups are prioritized. The order for the groups present is:\nCarboxylic Acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n### 3. Number the Benzene Ring\n\nWe must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n*   **C1** is fixed at the -COOH group.\n*   We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Path A (Clockwise):** C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CN, C6 is -OH. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Path B (Counter-clockwise):** C2 is -OH, C3 is -CN, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CHO, C6 is -N(CH3)2. The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince both numbering paths result in the same locant set, we must use a tie-breaker rule: the substituents are assigned the lowest possible locants based on their alphabetical order.\n*   The substituent names are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n*   We compare the two paths by looking at the locant assigned to the first substituent in the alphabetical list, which is \"cyano\".\n    *   In Path A (clockwise), \"cyano\" is at position 5.\n    *   In Path B (counter-clockwise), \"cyano\" is at position 3.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Path B (counter-clockwise) is the correct numbering scheme.**\n\nThe correct locants for the substituents are:\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **6-dimethylamino**\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nTo write the final name, list the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its correct locant, and then add the parent name.\n\n1.  **C**yano: **3-cyano**\n2.  **D**imethylamino: **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses used for clarity with complex substituents)\n3.  **F**ormyl: **5-formyl**\n4.  **H**ydroxy: **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **M**ethoxy: **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these alphabetically gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - This uses the incorrect (clockwise) numbering.\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This uses incorrect numbering and lists the substituents non-alphabetically.\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - This uses the correct numbering but lists the substituents non-alphabetically (by locant order).\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" prefix)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of Substituents\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description.\n\n*   **\"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"**\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1. The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups are at positions C3 and C5. For these three groups to be meta to each other, they must be in a 1,3,5-arrangement.\n\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at positions C2 and C6.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"**\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4.\n    *   The methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4.\n\nSo far, the partial structure is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2 (in some order)\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN (in some order)\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   This is the key to resolving the arrangement. \"Alcohol\" refers to the hydroxyl group (-OH), and \"nitrile\" refers to the cyano group (-CN).\n    *   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   Let's test the two possible positions for the nitrile (-CN) group:\n        1.  **If -CN is at C3:** The ortho positions are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho, so this works). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C2. This is a consistent arrangement.\n        2.  **If -CN is at C5:** The ortho positions are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho, so this works). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n\nThe description is slightly ambiguous as it can describe two molecules that are mirror images of each other (enantiomers). However, IUPAC naming rules will lead to a single, unambiguous name. Let's pick one of the valid structures (the first one we found) and apply the naming rules.\n\n**Structure:**\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n*   C3: -CN (cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\nThe principal group (-COOH) is at C1. We need to number the ring (from C2 to C6) to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n1.  There are two ways to number the ring: clockwise (C1 -> C2 -> C3...) or counter-clockwise (C1 -> C6 -> C5...).\n2.  In both cases, the set of locants for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. This is a tie.\n3.  To break the tie, we give the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n4.  Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n5.  The first group alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering direction that gives the cyano group the lowest possible number.\n    *   In our determined structure, the cyano group is at C3. If we numbered the other way, the dimethylamino group would be at C2 and the cyano group would be at C5.\n    *   Comparing the locant for \"cyano\": 3 is lower than 5.\n    *   Therefore, the correct numbering direction is the one that places the cyano group at C3. Our derived structure already uses this correct numbering.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\nNow, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nThe complete name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: substituents are not listed alphabetically)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: wrong numbering)\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: wrong numbering)\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct: matches our derived name)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct IUPAC name for a complex substituted benzene molecule. We must first deduce the structure of the molecule from the description and then apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name it.\n\n### Step 1: Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group on a benzene ring makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is assigned position **1**.\n\n2.  **Relative Positions of Key Groups:** \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   This means these three groups occupy positions 1, 3, and 5 relative to each other on the benzene ring.\n    *   Since the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, it is at position 1.\n    *   Therefore, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and the cyano group (-CN) must be at positions **3 and 5**.\n\n3.  **Positions of Other Substituents:**\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at positions **2 and 6**.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at position **4**.\n\n4.  **Final Structural Clue:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The ortho positions to C4 are C3 and C5. Since the nitrile (-CN) is at either C3 or C5, this condition is always met for the methoxy group.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6. It must be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), which is at C3 or C5. Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case A: If the nitrile (-CN) is at position 3.** For the alcohol to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at position 2 or 4. Since we know the alcohol is at C2 or C6, it **must be at C2**.\n        *   **Case B: If the nitrile (-CN) is at position 5.** For the alcohol to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at position 4 or 6. Since we know the alcohol is at C2 or C6, it **must be at C6**.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Full Structure:**\n    *   From Case A (nitrile at C3):\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl, the other meta group)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino, the other ortho group)\n    *   From Case B (nitrile at C5):\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   If you examine these two resulting structures, you will find they are identical. Structure B is just Structure A flipped horizontally. Therefore, the description points to a single, unique molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Applying IUPAC Nomenclature Rules\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** benzoic acid.\n2.  **Numbering:** The numbering starts at C1 (-COOH). We need to decide whether to number clockwise (1 -> 6 -> 5...) or counter-clockwise (1 -> 2 -> 3...). The rule is to choose the direction that gives the **lowest possible set of locants** to the substituents.\n    *   In our case, the substituents are at all other positions (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), so the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of the direction.\n3.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, the numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes **first in alphabetical order**.\n4.  **Alphabetical Order of Substituents:**\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n5.  **Comparing Numbering Directions:**\n    *   **Counter-clockwise (1 -> 2 -> 3...):** This gives the locants {2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino, 4-methoxy}.\n    *   **Clockwise (1 -> 6 -> 5...):** This gives the locants {6-hydroxy, 5-cyano, 3-formyl, 2-dimethylamino, 4-methoxy}.\n    *   Let's check the locant for the first substituent in the alphabetical list, which is \"cyano\".\n        *   Counter-clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **3**.\n        *   Clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise direction is correct**.\n\n6.  **Final Name Construction:** We use the locants from the counter-clockwise numbering and list the substituents in alphabetical order.\n    *   The correct locants are: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n    *   The name is constructed as: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 3: Matching with Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants and alphabetization.\n*   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants (results from choosing the wrong numbering direction).\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - This lists the substituents by number, not alphabetically, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule is based on a benzene ring. To determine the parent name, we must identify the functional group with the highest priority according to IUPAC rules. The groups present are:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl)\n    *   Cyano (-CN, prefix: cyano)\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH, prefix: hydroxy)\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix: dimethylamino)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH3, prefix: methoxy)\n\n    The priority order is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino.\n    Since the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position 1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents:**\n    Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting with C1 as the attachment point for the -COOH group.\n\n    *   **-COOH** is at position **1**.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and **cyano (-CN)** are meta to the -COOH. This means they are at positions 3 and 5.\n    *   **Methoxy (-OCH3)** is para to the -COOH. This places it at position **4**.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)** are ortho to the -COOH. This places them at positions 2 and 6.\n\n    Now we have to figure out the exact arrangement. We use the final piece of information: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at position 4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to the methoxy group. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So the cyano group must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n        *   **Case 1: Cyano at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since methoxy is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n        *   **Case 2: Cyano at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since methoxy is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n\n    The description also states that the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at positions 2 and 6.\n    *   In Case 1 (Cyano at C3), the hydroxyl is at C2. This means the dimethylamino group must be at C6.\n    *   In Case 2 (Cyano at C5), the hydroxyl is at C6. This means the dimethylamino group must be at C2.\n\n    Both cases are possible so far. Let's check the position of the carbaldehyde group. It must be at the remaining meta position (3 or 5).\n    *   In Case 1 (Cyano at C3), the carbaldehyde is at C5.\n    *   In Case 2 (Cyano at C5), the carbaldehyde is at C3.\n\n    This means we have two possible numbering schemes for the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring.\n\n    *   **Scheme A (Counter-clockwise):** 1-COOH, 2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH3, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH3)2\n    *   **Scheme B (Clockwise):** 1-COOH, 2-N(CH3)2, 3-CHO, 4-OCH3, 5-CN, 6-OH\n\n3.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Lowest Locant Rule):**\n    We need to choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest set of locants for the substituents. The set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for both schemes.\n    Since the locant sets are identical, we must use a tie-breaker rule: when two or more numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the direction is chosen that assigns the lowest number to the group cited first as a prefix in the name (i.e., first alphabetically).\n\n4.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    The prefixes for the substituents are:\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n\n    Alphabetically, \"cyano\" comes first. Therefore, we must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lowest possible number.\n\n    *   In Scheme A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Scheme B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use **Scheme A**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    Using the numbering from Scheme A, we have:\n    *   at C1: -COOH (the parent acid)\n    *   at C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   at C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   at C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   at C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   at C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n    Now, list the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their position numbers:\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy-**\n\n    Combine these alphabetically and add the parent name \"benzoic acid\" at the end.\n\n    The correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    This name matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Molecular Description\n\nFirst, let's break down the textual description into a list of substituents and their relative positions on a benzene ring.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main Functional Groups:**\n    1.  Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    2.  Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)\n    3.  Cyano group (-CN)\n    *   These three groups are **meta** to one another (e.g., at positions 1, 3, and 5).\n*   **Other Substituents (relative to the carboxylic acid):**\n    4.  Hydroxyl group (-OH), **ortho** to -COOH.\n    5.  Dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂), **ortho** to -COOH.\n    6.  Methoxy group (-OCH₃), **para** to -COOH.\n*   **Additional Positional Constraints:**\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is **ortho** to the cyano group (-CN).\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) is **ortho** to the cyano group (-CN).\n\n### 2. Determine the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we must identify the functional group with the highest priority to determine the parent name of the molecule. The priority order for the relevant groups is:\n\n**Carboxylic acid** > Aldehyde > Nitrile > Alcohol (Hydroxyl) > Amine > Ether (Methoxy)\n\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned the locant **1**.\n\n### 3. Draw the Structure\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the given information.\n\n1.  Place the **-COOH** group at position **C1**.\n2.  Since the methoxy group is **para** to the -COOH, place the **-OCH₃** group at position **C4**.\n3.  The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are **meta** to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C3 and C5.\n4.  The hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are **ortho** to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n\nOur ring currently looks like this:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃\n*   **C2/C6:** One is -OH, the other is -N(CH₃)₂\n*   **C3/C5:** One is -CHO, the other is -CN\n\nNow, we use the final constraints to determine the exact positions:\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4. Its ortho positions are C3 and C5. So the cyano group (-CN) must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) must also be ortho to the cyano group. Let's test the two possibilities for the position of -CN:\n        *   **Case A: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by -OCH₃, the -OH group must be at **C2**. This is a valid position for the -OH group.\n        *   **Case B: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by -OCH₃, the -OH group must be at **C6**. This is also a valid position for the -OH group.\n\nThese two cases (Case A and Case B) actually describe the same molecule, just viewed from a different perspective (they are enantiomers, but achiral due to a plane of symmetry if we consider the substituents themselves as points, but they are indeed the same molecule by rotation around the C1-C4 axis). Let's proceed with the structure from Case A, which is sufficient to determine the single correct IUPAC name.\n\nBased on Case A:\n*   If -CN is at C3 and -OH is at C2:\n    *   The remaining meta position, C5, must be the **-CHO** group.\n    *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must be the **-N(CH₃)₂** group.\n\nThe final, unique structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH\n*   **C3:** -CN\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃\n*   **C5:** -CHO\n*   **C6:** -N(CH₃)₂\n\n### 4. Number the Ring and Name the Molecule\n\nThe numbering starts with C1 for the -COOH group. We need to number the rest of the ring (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n\n*   Numbering clockwise from C1 gives substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1 also gives substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince there is a tie, IUPAC rules state that we choose the direction that assigns the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nNow let's see which position the first alphabetical substituent (cyano) gets in each numbering scheme:\n*   With our derived structure (C2=-OH, C3=-CN, etc.), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   If we were to number counter-clockwise, the positions would be C2=-N(CH₃)₂, C3=-CHO, C4=-OCH₃, C5=-CN, C6=-OH. In this case, the cyano group would be at C5.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering scheme is the one that assigns C3 to the cyano group. This corresponds to the structure as we derived it.\n\nThe final positions are:\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   3-cyano\n*   4-methoxy\n*   5-formyl\n*   6-dimethylamino\n\nFinally, we assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe full, correct IUPAC name is:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nOur derived name exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a systematic application of IUPAC nomenclature rules for substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core and Substituents:**\n    *   The core is a **benzene ring**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n        *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as 'formyl' when it's not the principal group.\n        *   Cyano (-CN), also known as nitrile.\n        *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as 'hydroxy'.\n        *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n        *   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\n2.  **Determine the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group:**\n    According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has the highest priority among the given functional groups. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n3.  **Draw the Structure based on Positional Information:**\n    *   Start by placing the -COOH group at **C1**.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH₃ is at C4**.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group\": The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, **-OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are at C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is at which position.\n    *   \"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5. Since all three are meta to each other, this 1,3,5-arrangement is confirmed. So, **-CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5**. We don't yet know which is at which position.\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\": This is the key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is at C4.\n        *   Case 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since methoxy is at C4, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2. This is a consistent arrangement.\n        *   Case 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since methoxy is at C4, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C6. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n\n    Let's write out the full structures for both cases:\n    *   **Structure from Case 1:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Structure from Case 2:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH₃)₂), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CN), C6(-OH)\n\n4.  **Apply Numbering Rules (Lowest Locants):**\n    *   The numbering must start from C1 (-COOH). We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise. The goal is to give the set of substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   For both structures derived above, the substituents are on carbons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Tie-breaker rule:** When two numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, we choose the direction that assigns the lowest number to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize Substituents:**\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n    The correct alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\n6.  **Apply the Tie-breaker and Finalize the Name:**\n    Let's analyze the numbering for the unique structure we have determined.\n    *   The structure is: C1(-COOH), C4(-OCH₃), C2/C6 (-OH, -NMe₂), C3/C5 (-CN, -CHO), with the specific constraints from step 3.\n    *   Let's consider the structure from Case 1 above: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Numbering Direction 1 (Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n    *   **Numbering Direction 2 (Counter-clockwise):** The substituents would be at: C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n    *   The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n        *   In Direction 1, 'cyano' is at position **3**.\n        *   In Direction 2, 'cyano' is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use **Direction 1**.\n\n7.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    Using the numbering from Direction 1:\n    *   Parent: benzoic acid\n    *   Substituents with locants:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Combine them alphabetically: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The generated name matches option B exactly.\n\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid: Incorrect numbering (violates the tie-breaker rule).\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid: **Correct.**\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid: Incorrect alphabetical order in the name.\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid: Incorrect alphabetical order in the name.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Molecule and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these.\n*   Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as **C1**.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents**\n\nLet's map out the positions of the other groups relative to C1:\n\n*   **Para (C4) Substituent:** The methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position **C4**.\n*   **Meta (C3 & C5) Substituents:** The carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and the cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid (C1) and also meta to each other. This places them at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n*   **Ortho (C2 & C6) Substituents:** The hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they are at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n\n**3. Use Additional Information to Fix the Structure**\n\nWe have one more piece of information: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be at either C3 or C5.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must be at either C2 or C6.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho). This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho, so it must be at **C6**.\n    *   If the hydroxyl is at C6, the dimethylamino group must be at **C2**.\n    *   If the cyano is at C5, the carbaldehyde group must be at **C3**.\n    *   This gives the structure: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n*   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho). This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho, so it must be at **C2**.\n    *   If the hydroxyl is at C2, the dimethylamino group must be at **C6**.\n    *   If the cyano is at C3, the carbaldehyde group must be at **C5**.\n    *   This gives the structure: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n\nNotice that these two cases describe the exact same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring. We have now unambiguously determined the constitution of the molecule. The final step is to apply the correct numbering rule.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\n*   **Rule 1: Lowest Locants.** We start at C1 (-COOH). We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   Clockwise numbering gives the substituent locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering also gives the locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since both directions give the same set of locants, we must use a tie-breaker rule.\n*   **Rule 2 (Tie-breaker): Alphabetical Priority.** When the locant set is identical, we give the lowest possible number to the substituent group that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents**\n\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   Cyano\n*   Dimethylamino\n*   Formyl (for the -CHO group)\n*   Hydroxy\n*   Methoxy\n\nIn alphabetical order, they are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nThe first group alphabetically is **cyano**. Therefore, we must choose the numbering direction that assigns the lowest number to the cyano group.\n\n*   **Numbering Direction 1 (from Case 1):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH. The cyano group is at **C5**.\n*   **Numbering Direction 2 (from Case 2):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2. The cyano group is at **C3**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering is the one from Direction 2.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\n\nUsing the correct numbering (C3-cyano), we list the substituents alphabetically with their locants:\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino) - parenthesis is used for complex substituents like dimethylamino.\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\", we get the full IUPAC name:\n\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\n\nFirst, we list all the functional groups present on the benzene ring:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, referred to as the 'formyl' group when a substituent)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules for priority of functional groups, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as locant number 1 (C1).\n\n**2. Place the Substituents on the Benzene Ring based on the Description**\n\nLet's map out the positions of the other groups relative to C1:\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4.\n    *   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   One of {C2, C6} is -OH (hydroxyl).\n    *   The other of {C2, C6} is -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino).\n\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: The carboxylic acid is at C1. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups must be at C3 and C5. Since C3 and C5 are also meta to each other, this condition is satisfied.\n    *   One of {C3, C5} is -CHO (formyl).\n    *   The other of {C3, C5} is -CN (cyano).\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\"**: This is the key clue to resolve the ambiguities. The nitrile group is -CN.\n    *   We know methoxy (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The -CN group must be ortho to C4, which means the -CN group must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) must also be ortho to the -CN group.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group's position:\n        *   **Scenario A: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. We know -OCH3 is at C4, which fits. This would mean the -OH group must be at C6.\n        *   **Scenario B: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. We know -OCH3 is at C4, which fits. This would mean the -OH group must be at C2.\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Numbering (Lowest Locant Rule)**\n\nWe now have two possible structures that fit the description. The next step is to number the ring according to IUPAC rules to decide which structure is correct. The primary rule is to assign numbers to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\nIn both scenarios, the substituents are located at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Since this set of locants is the same for both possibilities, we have a tie.\nThe tie-breaking rule states that when a choice exists, numbering should be assigned to give the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent names alphabetically:\n1.  **C**yano\n2.  **D**imethylamino\n3.  **F**ormyl\n4.  **H**ydroxy\n5.  **M**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**. Therefore, the numbering should be chosen to give the 'cyano' group the lowest possible number (either 3 or 5). Since 3 is lower than 5, the cyano group must be at **C3**.\n\nThis confirms **Scenario B** is the correct one.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Structure**\n\nBased on our deductions, the positions are:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (Since -CN is at C3, -OH must be at C2 to be ortho to it)\n*   **C3:** -CN (Gets the lower number, 3, based on alphabetization)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3\n*   **C5:** -CHO (The other meta position for the remaining group)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (The other ortho position for the remaining group)\n\n**5. Construct the IUPAC Name**\n\nNow, we assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)** (The parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name perfectly matches option B. Let's verify the other options:\n*   A) Not alphabetized correctly.\n*   C) This name corresponds to our rejected \"Scenario A\" where cyano is at C5, violating the lowest locant rule for alphabetically first substituent.\n*   D) Not alphabetized correctly.\n\nThus, the only correct IUPAC name based on the description and rules is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is my reasoning and thinking process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, I will break down the description to place each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Base Structure:** A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) all *meta* to one another. The simplest way to draw this is to place the main group, the carboxylic acid, at position 1. Then, the other two groups would be at positions 3 and 5 to satisfy the *meta* relationship (1,3- and 1,5- relationships are meta; 3,5- is also meta).\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C3: -CHO (Carbaldehyde/Formyl)\n    *   C5: -CN (Cyano)\n\n2.  **Add Substituents Relative to the Carboxylic Acid:**\n    *   *Ortho* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, these two groups are at C2 and C6, but we don't know which is which yet.\n    *   *Para* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) is a methoxy group (-OCH3). The para position is C4. So, the -OCH3 group is at C4.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Resolve Ambiguity:**\n    *   The description states: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) group is at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   We already placed the methoxy (-OCH3) group at C4, which is consistent with this statement.\n    *   Therefore, the alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) group must be at the other ortho position, C6.\n    *   This means the remaining ortho-to-COOH position, C2, must be occupied by the dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group.\n\nThe final structure is now unambiguously determined:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxyl)\n\n### 2. Determine the Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules for functional groups, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority among all the groups present. Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted **benzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Number the Benzene Ring\n\n*   The carbon atom bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) is assigned **locant 1**.\n*   We need to number the remaining positions (2 through 6) to give the lowest possible set of locants to the other substituents. We can number either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Numbering clockwise:** Substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   **Numbering counter-clockwise:** Starting from C1, C6 would become C2, C5 would become C3, etc. The substituents would still be at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n*   Since both directions yield the same locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use a tie-breaker rule. The rule states that we assign numbering to give the lowest locants to substituents cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n### 4. Alphabetize the Substituents\n\nLet's list the substituents and alphabetize them. Note that when naming, the carbaldehyde group (-CHO) is named \"formyl\" and the nitrile group (-CN) is named \"cyano\".\n*   -CN: **c**yano\n*   -N(CH3)2: **d**imethylamino\n*   -CHO: **f**ormyl\n*   -OH: **h**ydroxy\n*   -OCH3: **m**ethoxy\n\nThe alphabetical order is: **cyano**, **dimethylamino**, **formyl**, **hydroxy**, **methoxy**.\n\n### 5. Apply the Numbering Tie-Breaker\n\nNow, let's compare the two numbering schemes based on the position of the alphabetically first substituent, \"cyano\".\n\n*   **Clockwise Numbering:** Based on our drawing, the -N(CH3)2 is at C2 and the **-CN is at C5**.\n*   **Counter-clockwise Numbering:** The -OH would be at C2 and the **-CN would be at C3**.\n\nSince **3 is lower than 5**, the counter-clockwise numbering scheme is correct.\n\nThe correct locants for each substituent are:\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)**\n\n### 6. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nWe list the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants, and finish with the parent name.\n\n1.  3-cyano-\n2.  6-(dimethylamino)-\n3.  5-formyl-\n4.  2-hydroxy-\n5.  4-methoxy-\n6.  benzoic acid\n\nCombining these in the correct order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 7. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical ordering in the name)\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical ordering in the name)\n*   D) **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** (Matches our derived name)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Chemical Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to build a model of the molecule.\n-   **Core:** A benzene ring.\n-   **Highest Priority Group:** The problem lists a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which, according to IUPAC rules, is the highest priority among the given functional groups. This means the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n-   **Substituent Positions relative to C1 (-COOH):**\n    -   *ortho* (C2 and C6): one hydroxyl (-OH) group and one dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group.\n    -   *para* (C4): one methoxy (-OCH₃) group.\n-   **Meta-related groups:** The carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group are all *meta* to one another. This means they are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the ring. Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n-   **Final constraint for positioning:** The methoxy group (-OCH₃) and the alcohol/hydroxyl group (-OH) are both *ortho* (adjacent) to the nitrile/cyano group (-CN).\n\nLet's use this information to determine the exact position of each substituent.\n1.  Place -COOH at **C1**.\n2.  Place -OCH₃ at **C4** (para to C1).\n3.  The -CHO and -CN groups are at **C3** and **C5**.\n4.  The -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ groups are at **C2** and **C6**.\n5.  Now use the final constraint: -OCH₃ (at C4) and -OH are ortho to -CN.\n    -   The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So -CN must be at C3 or C5, which is consistent.\n    -   Let's test if **-CN is at C3**. The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n    -   Let's test if **-CN is at C5**. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C6. This also works.\n\nWe have two potential arrangements which are actually the same molecule, just numbered differently from C1:\n-   **Arrangement A (Numbering Counter-Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n-   **Arrangement B (Numbering Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH\n\n### 2. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nThe principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We must number the remaining carbons to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants (numbers).\n-   In both Arrangement A and Arrangement B, the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n-   When the locant sets are identical, IUPAC rules state that we must give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nNow let's compare the two numbering arrangements based on the position of the alphabetically first substituent, \"cyano\":\n-   In Arrangement A (counter-clockwise), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n-   In Arrangement B (clockwise), the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the counter-clockwise numbering of Arrangement A is correct.\n\nSo, the correct assignment of substituents is:\n-   C1: -COOH\n-   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n-   C3: -CN (cyano)\n-   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n-   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n-   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n\n### 3. Assemble the Final Name\n\nTo write the final IUPAC name, list the substituents (with their locants) in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for clarity with complex/substituted substituents)\n3.  **5-formyl**\n4.  **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these parts alphabetically gives the name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 4. Compare with the Given Options\n\n-   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering.*\n-   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - *Correct numbering, but prefixes are listed numerically, not alphabetically.*\n-   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *This exactly matches our derived name.*\n-   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering and incorrect alphabetical order.*\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a systematic approach to IUPAC nomenclature. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Identify Substituents and the Parent Ring\n*   **Parent Ring**: Benzene\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents**:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as a 'formyl' prefix.\n    *   Cyano (-CN), named as a 'cyano' prefix.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as a 'hydroxy' prefix.\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\n### 2. Determine the Principal Functional Group\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the functional groups are ranked as follows:\nCarboxylic acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether.\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. This makes the parent molecule a **benzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Draw the Structure and Number the Ring\n\n1.  **Assign C1**: The carbon atom attached to the principal group (-COOH) is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Place the other groups based on the description**:\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": Methoxy (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ groups are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n3.  **Use the final clue to fix the positions**:\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\".\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile group (-CN) must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   If the -CN group were at C5, its ortho positions would be C4 and C6.\n    *   If the -CN group were at C3, its ortho positions would be C2 and C4.\n    *   The description states that both the methoxy (-OCH₃ at C4) and the alcohol/hydroxyl (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile. This is only possible if the **nitrile (-CN) is at C3**, which puts the **hydroxyl (-OH) at C2**.\n\n4.  **Finalize the Structure**:\n    *   **C1**: -COOH\n    *   **C2**: -OH (ortho to -COOH and ortho to -CN)\n    *   **C3**: -CN (meta to -COOH and ortho to -OCH₃ and -OH)\n    *   **C4**: -OCH₃ (para to -COOH and ortho to -CN)\n    *   **C5**: This leaves the remaining meta position for the carbaldehyde (-CHO).\n    *   **C6**: This leaves the remaining ortho position for the dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group.\n\n    The structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (Hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino)\n\n    This structure and numbering scheme satisfies all the conditions described in the question.\n\n### 4. Assemble the IUPAC Name\n\n1.  **Alphabetize the prefixes**: The prefixes must be listed in alphabetical order, not numerical order.\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n\n2.  **Combine prefixes with their locants and the parent name**:\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are often used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This exactly matches our derived name.\n*   B) This option uses incorrect numbering.\n*   C) This option incorrectly orders the substituents numerically instead of alphabetically.\n*   D) This option uses incorrect locants.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Molecule**\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to build a structural representation of the molecule. We will use a temporary numbering system on a benzene ring to place the groups, which may not be the final IUPAC numbering.\n\n*   **Core structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main groups:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group are all *meta* (1,3-positions) to one another. Let's place the primary functional group, the carboxylic acid, at position 1. This means the other two groups are at positions 3 and 5.\n    *   -COOH at C1\n    *   -CHO at C3\n    *   -CN at C5\n\n    ```\n        (C1)-COOH\n       /      \\\n     C6        C2\n    /          \\\n   (C5)-CN -- C4 -- (C3)-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Substituents relative to the carboxylic acid:**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* (1,2-positions) to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* (1,4-position) to the carboxylic acid. This places it at C4.\n\n    Let's update the drawing with this information:\n    ```\n          (C1)-COOH\n         /         \\\n    (C6)-(OH/NMe2) (C2)-(NMe2/OH)\n      |                |\n    (C5)-CN -------- (C4)-OCH3 -------- (C3)-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Final positioning clue:** The methoxy group and the alcohol group (-OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile group (-CN).\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is at C5. The positions *ortho* to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is already at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This confirms its placement.\n    *   Therefore, the alcohol (-OH) must be at the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   This forces the remaining dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group to be at C2.\n\n**The final, unambiguous structure is:**\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxy)\n\n**2. Determine the Parent Compound and IUPAC Numbering**\n\n*   **Parent Compound:** The IUPAC priority of functional groups is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > ... > Alcohol > Amine > Ether. The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest priority group, so the parent name is **benzoic acid**.\n*   **Numbering:**\n    *   The carbon atom bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) must be assigned locant 1 (C1).\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** C1-COOH, C2-NMe2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH. The locant set for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-NMe2. The locant set for the substituents is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Tie-breaker rule:** When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, we choose the scheme that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n**3. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Alphabetize the substituents:**\n    1.  **C**yano\n    2.  **D**imethylamino\n    3.  **F**ormyl (the prefix for a -CHO group when it's not the principal group)\n    4.  **H**ydroxy\n    5.  **M**ethoxy\n\n*   **Apply the tie-breaker:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering direction that gives the \"cyano\" group the lowest possible number.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering places the cyano group at C5.\n    *   Clockwise numbering places the cyano group at C3.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **we must use the clockwise numbering scheme**.\n\n*   **Assign the correct locants based on clockwise numbering:**\n    *   **hydroxy** is at C2\n    *   **cyano** is at C3\n    *   **methoxy** is at C4\n    *   **formyl** is at C5\n    *   **dimethylamino** is at C6\n\n*   **Construct the name:** List the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its correct locant, and then add the parent name.\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together, the correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**4.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name for the molecule described.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   The functional groups are: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂), and methoxy (-OCH₃).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is assigned the number **1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure from Positional Clues\n*   **-COOH** is at **C1**.\n*   **Methoxy (-OCH₃)** is *para* to the -COOH group, so it is at **C4**.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)** are *ortho* to the -COOH group, so they occupy positions **C2 and C6**.\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and **cyano (-CN)** are *meta* to the -COOH group (and to each other), so they occupy positions **C3 and C5**.\n\nSo far, the general layout is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH₃)₂\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n*   C4: -OCH₃\n\nThe final clue resolves the ambiguities:\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   \"Alcohol\" refers to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   \"Nitrile\" refers to the cyano (-CN) group.\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4. The cyano group must be ortho to it (at C3 or C5), which is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the cyano group.\n        *   If the cyano group is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. For the hydroxyl to be ortho, it must be at C2. This works.\n        *   If the cyano group is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. For the hydroxyl to be ortho, it must be at C6. This also works.\n\nWe have two scenarios that are mirror images. We can use IUPAC numbering rules to determine the single correct name.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n*   The primary rule is to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants (numbers). Starting from C1, both clockwise and counter-clockwise numbering result in the same locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   **Tie-breaker Rule:** When the locant set is identical, we choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes **first in alphabetical order**.\n\n### 4. Alphabetize Substituents and Apply Tie-Breaker\n*   The substituents (as prefixes) are:\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n*   The first in alphabetical order is **cyano**. Therefore, we must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lowest possible number.\n*   Comparing our two scenarios from step 2:\n    *   In the first scenario, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In the second scenario, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the first scenario's numbering is correct.\n\n### 5. Finalize the Structure and Name\nThe correct arrangement and numbering is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n*   C3: -CN (cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n*   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n*   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n\nNow, we construct the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their number, and ending with the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano-**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n3.  **5-formyl-**\n4.  **2-hydroxy-**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n6.  **benzoic acid**\n\nThe full, correct IUPAC name is:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Identify the Parent Compound and Substituents\n\n*   **Parent Compound:** The molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC rules, this is the principal functional group, and the parent name is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO) is named as a **formyl** group.\n    *   Cyano (-CN) is named as a **cyano** group.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH) is named as a **hydroxy** group.\n    *   Dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂) is named as a **(dimethylamino)** group.\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃) is named as a **methoxy** group.\n\n### 2. Draw the Structure Based on Positional Information\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring, starting with the principal functional group at C1.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH (This defines the parent benzoic acid).\n\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three groups to be mutually meta, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n*   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4. So, the **methoxy group is at C4**.\n\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6.\n\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   This is the key constraint to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to it, meaning the cyano group must be at C3 or C5. The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (ortho), which is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at C2 (ortho).\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to C1 (which is C6) must be occupied by the dimethylamino group.\n    *   And the remaining meta position (C5) must be occupied by the formyl group.\n    *   This gives **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂.\n\n*   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (ortho), which is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at C6 (ortho).\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to C1 (which is C2) must be occupied by the dimethylamino group.\n    *   And the remaining meta position (C3) must be occupied by the formyl group.\n    *   This gives **Structure II**: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\nBoth structures fully satisfy the description. Fortunately, as we will see, IUPAC rules lead to the same name for both. Let's name Structure I.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n*   **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n*   Numbering starts at C1. We can number clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW).\n*   The set of locants for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for both directions.\n*   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, we number in the direction that gives the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically: **C**yano, **D**imethylamino, **F**ormyl, **H**ydroxy, **M**ethoxy.\n*   Now, let's write the sequence of locants for this alphabetical list for both numbering directions:\n    *   **CW Numbering (2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH₃, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH₃)₂):**\n        *   Cyano is at 3.\n        *   Dimethylamino is at 6.\n        *   Formyl is at 5.\n        *   Hydroxy is at 2.\n        *   Methoxy is at 4.\n        *   The locant sequence is **{3, 6, 5, 2, 4}**.\n    *   **CCW Numbering (2-N(CH₃)₂, 3-CHO, 4-OCH₃, 5-CN, 6-OH):**\n        *   Cyano is at 5.\n        *   Dimethylamino is at 2.\n        *   ...and so on.\n        *   The locant sequence is **{5, 2, 3, 6, 4}**.\n*   We compare the two sequences term by term: {**3**, 6, 5, 2, 4} vs {**5**, 2, 3, 6, 4}. Since 3 is lower than 5, the first sequence is preferred.\n*   Therefore, the **Clockwise (CW) numbering is correct**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing the correct (CW) numbering, the locants are:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nList these alphabetically to construct the final name:\n3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option A. (If we were to name Structure II, the same procedure would also lead to this exact name, as the counter-clockwise direction would be chosen).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound:** The molecule is a substituted benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Map the Substituent Positions:** Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, with the -COOH group at C1.\n\n    *   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at C2 and C6, but we don't yet know which is where.\n    *   **\"a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: This means the carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Resolve Ambiguities:** The final piece of information is: **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"** The methoxy group is fixed at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) can be at C3 or C5.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n        *   The methoxy group at C4 is indeed ortho to C5. This works.\n        *   For the alcohol (hydroxyl group) to also be ortho to C5, it must be at C6.\n        *   This means the -OH is at C6.\n        *   The remaining ortho position (C2) must be occupied by the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   The remaining meta position (C3) must be occupied by the -CHO group.\n        *   This gives **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n        *   The methoxy group at C4 is indeed ortho to C3. This works.\n        *   For the alcohol (hydroxyl group) to also be ortho to C3, it must be at C2.\n        *   This means the -OH is at C2.\n        *   The remaining ortho position (C6) must be occupied by the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   The remaining meta position (C5) must be occupied by the -CHO group.\n        *   This gives **Structure II**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Naming Rules to Both Possible Structures:** The descriptive text is ambiguous and fits two different molecules. We must name both and then apply a tie-breaking rule. The locants for the substituents in both cases are the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant set is identical, IUPAC rules state that we choose the numbering scheme that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   First, let's alphabetize the substituent names:\n        *   **C**yano\n        *   **D**imethylamino\n        *   **F**ormyl (the prefix for -CHO when it's a substituent)\n        *   **H**ydroxy\n        *   **M**ethoxy\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is **Cyano**. We should choose the structure where the cyano group has the lower number.\n\n    *   **Naming Structure I (from Case 1):**\n        *   The cyano group is at **C5**.\n        *   The name is: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. (This matches option D).\n\n    *   **Naming Structure II (from Case 2):**\n        *   The cyano group is at **C3**.\n        *   The name is: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. (This matches option C).\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Name:** According to the IUPAC tie-breaking rule, we must give the lowest locant to the first group in alphabetical order (cyano). Structure II gives the cyano group locant 3, while Structure I gives it locant 5. Since 3 is lower than 5, Structure II and its corresponding name are correct.\n\n    The correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**.\n*   The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned locant number **1**.\n\n**2. Draw the Structure Based on the Positional Information**\n\nLet's place the substituents on the ring starting with C1 = -COOH.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at **C2 and C6** (we don't know which is which yet).\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups must be at **C3 and C5**. This also satisfies the condition that they are meta to each other (C3 and C5 are meta).\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\"**: This is the key constraint to finalize the structure.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group, so the -CN must be at **C3 or C5**.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the -CN group.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group:\n        *   **If -CN is at C3**: Its ortho positions are C2 and C4. We know -OCH3 is at C4. The -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n        *   **If -CN is at C5**: Its ortho positions are C4 and C6. We know -OCH3 is at C4. The -OH group must be at C6. This also works.\n\nIt turns out both possibilities describe valid structures (which are enantiomers of each other). However, they will have the same IUPAC name (without stereochemical descriptors) because the naming rules are unambiguous. Let's pick one of these valid structures to name.\n\nLet's use the structure where: -CN is at C3 and -OH is at C2.\nThis means the remaining groups are: -N(CH3)2 at C6 and -CHO at C5.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n*   **C1**: -COOH\n*   **C2**: -OH\n*   **C3**: -CN\n*   **C4**: -OCH3\n*   **C5**: -CHO\n*   **C6**: -N(CH3)2\n\n**3. Number the Ring According to IUPAC Rules**\n\n*   C1 is fixed. We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants to the substituents.\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Numbering clockwise gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since the locant sets are identical, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The numbering direction that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent that appears first alphabetically is chosen.\n\n**4. Alphabetize the Substituents and Apply the Tie-Breaker**\n\nThe substituents (other than the parent acid) are:\n*   cyano (-CN)\n*   dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) -> alphabetized under 'd'\n*   formyl (-CHO) -> the name for an aldehyde group as a substituent\n*   hydroxy (-OH)\n*   methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nIn alphabetical order, they are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nNow, let's check the locant for the first group in this list (\"cyano\") in both numbering directions:\n*   **Counter-clockwise numbering (as drawn above)**: -OH is at C2, **-CN is at C3**.\n*   **Clockwise numbering**: -N(CH3)2 is at C2, -CHO is at C3, -OCH3 is at C4, **-CN is at C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise direction is correct**. The locants are assigned as we determined in Step 2.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name**\n\n*   **Parent name**: benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents with correct locants**: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n*   **Arrange alphabetically**:\n    *   3-cyano-\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)-\n    *   5-formyl-\n    *   2-hydroxy-\n    *   4-methoxy\n*   **Combine**: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the written description into a chemical structure.\n\n*   **Core:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main Groups:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO, also named as the substituent \"formyl\"), and a cyano group (-CN). They are all *meta* (1,3-position) to one another. This implies a 1,3,5-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   **Assigning Initial Positions:** Let's place the highest priority group, the carboxylic acid (-COOH), at position C1. This makes the parent molecule a benzoic acid. The other two groups, -CHO and -CN, must be at C3 and C5 to satisfy the *meta-to-each-other* condition.\n*   **Placing Other Substituents:**\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2)\". The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3)\". The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n    *   **Crucial Constraint:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\". The nitrile (-CN) is at C5 (we could have placed it at C3, the result would be the same after renumbering).\n        *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. C4 is indeed ortho to C5. This is consistent.\n        *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the -OH group must be at **C6**.\n    *   **Finalizing the Structure:** Since the -OH group is at C6, the other group ortho to the carboxylic acid, the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2), must be at **C2**.\n\nThe final, unambiguous structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (Hydroxy)\n\n### 2. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, functional groups are prioritized. The order for the groups present is:\nCarboxylic Acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n### 3. Number the Benzene Ring\n\nWe must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n*   **C1** is fixed at the -COOH group.\n*   We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Path A (Clockwise):** C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CN, C6 is -OH. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Path B (Counter-clockwise):** C2 is -OH, C3 is -CN, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CHO, C6 is -N(CH3)2. The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince both numbering paths result in the same locant set, we must use a tie-breaker rule: the substituents are assigned the lowest possible locants based on their alphabetical order.\n*   The substituent names are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n*   We compare the two paths by looking at the locant assigned to the first substituent in the alphabetical list, which is \"cyano\".\n    *   In Path A (clockwise), \"cyano\" is at position 5.\n    *   In Path B (counter-clockwise), \"cyano\" is at position 3.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Path B (counter-clockwise) is the correct numbering scheme.**\n\nThe correct locants for the substituents are:\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **6-dimethylamino**\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nTo write the final name, list the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its correct locant, and then add the parent name.\n\n1.  **C**yano: **3-cyano**\n2.  **D**imethylamino: **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses used for clarity with complex substituents)\n3.  **F**ormyl: **5-formyl**\n4.  **H**ydroxy: **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **M**ethoxy: **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these alphabetically gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - This uses the incorrect (clockwise) numbering.\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This uses incorrect numbering and lists the substituents non-alphabetically.\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - This uses the correct numbering but lists the substituents non-alphabetically (by locant order).\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" prefix)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of Substituents\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description.\n\n*   **\"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"**\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1. The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups are at positions C3 and C5. For these three groups to be meta to each other, they must be in a 1,3,5-arrangement.\n\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at positions C2 and C6.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"**\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4.\n    *   The methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4.\n\nSo far, the partial structure is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2 (in some order)\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN (in some order)\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   This is the key to resolving the arrangement. \"Alcohol\" refers to the hydroxyl group (-OH), and \"nitrile\" refers to the cyano group (-CN).\n    *   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   Let's test the two possible positions for the nitrile (-CN) group:\n        1.  **If -CN is at C3:** The ortho positions are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho, so this works). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C2. This is a consistent arrangement.\n        2.  **If -CN is at C5:** The ortho positions are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho, so this works). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n\nThe description is slightly ambiguous as it can describe two molecules that are mirror images of each other (enantiomers). However, IUPAC naming rules will lead to a single, unambiguous name. Let's pick one of the valid structures (the first one we found) and apply the naming rules.\n\n**Structure:**\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n*   C3: -CN (cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\nThe principal group (-COOH) is at C1. We need to number the ring (from C2 to C6) to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n1.  There are two ways to number the ring: clockwise (C1 -> C2 -> C3...) or counter-clockwise (C1 -> C6 -> C5...).\n2.  In both cases, the set of locants for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. This is a tie.\n3.  To break the tie, we give the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n4.  Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n5.  The first group alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering direction that gives the cyano group the lowest possible number.\n    *   In our determined structure, the cyano group is at C3. If we numbered the other way, the dimethylamino group would be at C2 and the cyano group would be at C5.\n    *   Comparing the locant for \"cyano\": 3 is lower than 5.\n    *   Therefore, the correct numbering direction is the one that places the cyano group at C3. Our derived structure already uses this correct numbering.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\nNow, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nThe complete name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: substituents are not listed alphabetically)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: wrong numbering)\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: wrong numbering)\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct: matches our derived name)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct IUPAC name for a complex substituted benzene molecule. We must first deduce the structure of the molecule from the description and then apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name it.\n\n### Step 1: Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group on a benzene ring makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is assigned position **1**.\n\n2.  **Relative Positions of Key Groups:** \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   This means these three groups occupy positions 1, 3, and 5 relative to each other on the benzene ring.\n    *   Since the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, it is at position 1.\n    *   Therefore, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and the cyano group (-CN) must be at positions **3 and 5**.\n\n3.  **Positions of Other Substituents:**\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at positions **2 and 6**.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at position **4**.\n\n4.  **Final Structural Clue:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The ortho positions to C4 are C3 and C5. Since the nitrile (-CN) is at either C3 or C5, this condition is always met for the methoxy group.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6. It must be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), which is at C3 or C5. Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case A: If the nitrile (-CN) is at position 3.** For the alcohol to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at position 2 or 4. Since we know the alcohol is at C2 or C6, it **must be at C2**.\n        *   **Case B: If the nitrile (-CN) is at position 5.** For the alcohol to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at position 4 or 6. Since we know the alcohol is at C2 or C6, it **must be at C6**.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Full Structure:**\n    *   From Case A (nitrile at C3):\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl, the other meta group)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino, the other ortho group)\n    *   From Case B (nitrile at C5):\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   If you examine these two resulting structures, you will find they are identical. Structure B is just Structure A flipped horizontally. Therefore, the description points to a single, unique molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Applying IUPAC Nomenclature Rules\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** benzoic acid.\n2.  **Numbering:** The numbering starts at C1 (-COOH). We need to decide whether to number clockwise (1 -> 6 -> 5...) or counter-clockwise (1 -> 2 -> 3...). The rule is to choose the direction that gives the **lowest possible set of locants** to the substituents.\n    *   In our case, the substituents are at all other positions (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), so the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of the direction.\n3.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, the numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes **first in alphabetical order**.\n4.  **Alphabetical Order of Substituents:**\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n5.  **Comparing Numbering Directions:**\n    *   **Counter-clockwise (1 -> 2 -> 3...):** This gives the locants {2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino, 4-methoxy}.\n    *   **Clockwise (1 -> 6 -> 5...):** This gives the locants {6-hydroxy, 5-cyano, 3-formyl, 2-dimethylamino, 4-methoxy}.\n    *   Let's check the locant for the first substituent in the alphabetical list, which is \"cyano\".\n        *   Counter-clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **3**.\n        *   Clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise direction is correct**.\n\n6.  **Final Name Construction:** We use the locants from the counter-clockwise numbering and list the substituents in alphabetical order.\n    *   The correct locants are: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n    *   The name is constructed as: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 3: Matching with Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants and alphabetization.\n*   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants (results from choosing the wrong numbering direction).\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - This lists the substituents by number, not alphabetically, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule is based on a benzene ring. To determine the parent name, we must identify the functional group with the highest priority according to IUPAC rules. The groups present are:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl)\n    *   Cyano (-CN, prefix: cyano)\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH, prefix: hydroxy)\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix: dimethylamino)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH3, prefix: methoxy)\n\n    The priority order is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino.\n    Since the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position 1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents:**\n    Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting with C1 as the attachment point for the -COOH group.\n\n    *   **-COOH** is at position **1**.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and **cyano (-CN)** are meta to the -COOH. This means they are at positions 3 and 5.\n    *   **Methoxy (-OCH3)** is para to the -COOH. This places it at position **4**.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)** are ortho to the -COOH. This places them at positions 2 and 6.\n\n    Now we have to figure out the exact arrangement. We use the final piece of information: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at position 4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to the methoxy group. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So the cyano group must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n        *   **Case 1: Cyano at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since methoxy is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n        *   **Case 2: Cyano at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since methoxy is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n\n    The description also states that the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at positions 2 and 6.\n    *   In Case 1 (Cyano at C3), the hydroxyl is at C2. This means the dimethylamino group must be at C6.\n    *   In Case 2 (Cyano at C5), the hydroxyl is at C6. This means the dimethylamino group must be at C2.\n\n    Both cases are possible so far. Let's check the position of the carbaldehyde group. It must be at the remaining meta position (3 or 5).\n    *   In Case 1 (Cyano at C3), the carbaldehyde is at C5.\n    *   In Case 2 (Cyano at C5), the carbaldehyde is at C3.\n\n    This means we have two possible numbering schemes for the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring.\n\n    *   **Scheme A (Counter-clockwise):** 1-COOH, 2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH3, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH3)2\n    *   **Scheme B (Clockwise):** 1-COOH, 2-N(CH3)2, 3-CHO, 4-OCH3, 5-CN, 6-OH\n\n3.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Lowest Locant Rule):**\n    We need to choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest set of locants for the substituents. The set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for both schemes.\n    Since the locant sets are identical, we must use a tie-breaker rule: when two or more numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the direction is chosen that assigns the lowest number to the group cited first as a prefix in the name (i.e., first alphabetically).\n\n4.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    The prefixes for the substituents are:\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n\n    Alphabetically, \"cyano\" comes first. Therefore, we must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lowest possible number.\n\n    *   In Scheme A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Scheme B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use **Scheme A**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    Using the numbering from Scheme A, we have:\n    *   at C1: -COOH (the parent acid)\n    *   at C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   at C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   at C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   at C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   at C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n    Now, list the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their position numbers:\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy-**\n\n    Combine these alphabetically and add the parent name \"benzoic acid\" at the end.\n\n    The correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    This name matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Molecular Description\n\nFirst, let's break down the textual description into a list of substituents and their relative positions on a benzene ring.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main Functional Groups:**\n    1.  Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    2.  Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)\n    3.  Cyano group (-CN)\n    *   These three groups are **meta** to one another (e.g., at positions 1, 3, and 5).\n*   **Other Substituents (relative to the carboxylic acid):**\n    4.  Hydroxyl group (-OH), **ortho** to -COOH.\n    5.  Dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂), **ortho** to -COOH.\n    6.  Methoxy group (-OCH₃), **para** to -COOH.\n*   **Additional Positional Constraints:**\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is **ortho** to the cyano group (-CN).\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) is **ortho** to the cyano group (-CN).\n\n### 2. Determine the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we must identify the functional group with the highest priority to determine the parent name of the molecule. The priority order for the relevant groups is:\n\n**Carboxylic acid** > Aldehyde > Nitrile > Alcohol (Hydroxyl) > Amine > Ether (Methoxy)\n\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned the locant **1**.\n\n### 3. Draw the Structure\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the given information.\n\n1.  Place the **-COOH** group at position **C1**.\n2.  Since the methoxy group is **para** to the -COOH, place the **-OCH₃** group at position **C4**.\n3.  The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are **meta** to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C3 and C5.\n4.  The hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are **ortho** to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n\nOur ring currently looks like this:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃\n*   **C2/C6:** One is -OH, the other is -N(CH₃)₂\n*   **C3/C5:** One is -CHO, the other is -CN\n\nNow, we use the final constraints to determine the exact positions:\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4. Its ortho positions are C3 and C5. So the cyano group (-CN) must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) must also be ortho to the cyano group. Let's test the two possibilities for the position of -CN:\n        *   **Case A: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by -OCH₃, the -OH group must be at **C2**. This is a valid position for the -OH group.\n        *   **Case B: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by -OCH₃, the -OH group must be at **C6**. This is also a valid position for the -OH group.\n\nThese two cases (Case A and Case B) actually describe the same molecule, just viewed from a different perspective (they are enantiomers, but achiral due to a plane of symmetry if we consider the substituents themselves as points, but they are indeed the same molecule by rotation around the C1-C4 axis). Let's proceed with the structure from Case A, which is sufficient to determine the single correct IUPAC name.\n\nBased on Case A:\n*   If -CN is at C3 and -OH is at C2:\n    *   The remaining meta position, C5, must be the **-CHO** group.\n    *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must be the **-N(CH₃)₂** group.\n\nThe final, unique structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH\n*   **C3:** -CN\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃\n*   **C5:** -CHO\n*   **C6:** -N(CH₃)₂\n\n### 4. Number the Ring and Name the Molecule\n\nThe numbering starts with C1 for the -COOH group. We need to number the rest of the ring (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n\n*   Numbering clockwise from C1 gives substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1 also gives substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince there is a tie, IUPAC rules state that we choose the direction that assigns the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nNow let's see which position the first alphabetical substituent (cyano) gets in each numbering scheme:\n*   With our derived structure (C2=-OH, C3=-CN, etc.), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   If we were to number counter-clockwise, the positions would be C2=-N(CH₃)₂, C3=-CHO, C4=-OCH₃, C5=-CN, C6=-OH. In this case, the cyano group would be at C5.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering scheme is the one that assigns C3 to the cyano group. This corresponds to the structure as we derived it.\n\nThe final positions are:\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   3-cyano\n*   4-methoxy\n*   5-formyl\n*   6-dimethylamino\n\nFinally, we assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe full, correct IUPAC name is:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nOur derived name exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a systematic application of IUPAC nomenclature rules for substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core and Substituents:**\n    *   The core is a **benzene ring**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n        *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as 'formyl' when it's not the principal group.\n        *   Cyano (-CN), also known as nitrile.\n        *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as 'hydroxy'.\n        *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n        *   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\n2.  **Determine the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group:**\n    According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has the highest priority among the given functional groups. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n3.  **Draw the Structure based on Positional Information:**\n    *   Start by placing the -COOH group at **C1**.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH₃ is at C4**.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group\": The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, **-OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are at C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is at which position.\n    *   \"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5. Since all three are meta to each other, this 1,3,5-arrangement is confirmed. So, **-CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5**. We don't yet know which is at which position.\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\": This is the key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is at C4.\n        *   Case 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since methoxy is at C4, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2. This is a consistent arrangement.\n        *   Case 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since methoxy is at C4, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C6. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n\n    Let's write out the full structures for both cases:\n    *   **Structure from Case 1:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Structure from Case 2:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH₃)₂), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CN), C6(-OH)\n\n4.  **Apply Numbering Rules (Lowest Locants):**\n    *   The numbering must start from C1 (-COOH). We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise. The goal is to give the set of substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   For both structures derived above, the substituents are on carbons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Tie-breaker rule:** When two numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, we choose the direction that assigns the lowest number to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize Substituents:**\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n    The correct alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\n6.  **Apply the Tie-breaker and Finalize the Name:**\n    Let's analyze the numbering for the unique structure we have determined.\n    *   The structure is: C1(-COOH), C4(-OCH₃), C2/C6 (-OH, -NMe₂), C3/C5 (-CN, -CHO), with the specific constraints from step 3.\n    *   Let's consider the structure from Case 1 above: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Numbering Direction 1 (Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n    *   **Numbering Direction 2 (Counter-clockwise):** The substituents would be at: C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n    *   The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n        *   In Direction 1, 'cyano' is at position **3**.\n        *   In Direction 2, 'cyano' is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use **Direction 1**.\n\n7.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    Using the numbering from Direction 1:\n    *   Parent: benzoic acid\n    *   Substituents with locants:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Combine them alphabetically: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The generated name matches option B exactly.\n\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid: Incorrect numbering (violates the tie-breaker rule).\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid: **Correct.**\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid: Incorrect alphabetical order in the name.\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid: Incorrect alphabetical order in the name.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Molecule and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these.\n*   Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as **C1**.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents**\n\nLet's map out the positions of the other groups relative to C1:\n\n*   **Para (C4) Substituent:** The methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position **C4**.\n*   **Meta (C3 & C5) Substituents:** The carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and the cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid (C1) and also meta to each other. This places them at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n*   **Ortho (C2 & C6) Substituents:** The hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they are at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n\n**3. Use Additional Information to Fix the Structure**\n\nWe have one more piece of information: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be at either C3 or C5.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must be at either C2 or C6.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho). This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho, so it must be at **C6**.\n    *   If the hydroxyl is at C6, the dimethylamino group must be at **C2**.\n    *   If the cyano is at C5, the carbaldehyde group must be at **C3**.\n    *   This gives the structure: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n*   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho). This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho, so it must be at **C2**.\n    *   If the hydroxyl is at C2, the dimethylamino group must be at **C6**.\n    *   If the cyano is at C3, the carbaldehyde group must be at **C5**.\n    *   This gives the structure: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n\nNotice that these two cases describe the exact same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring. We have now unambiguously determined the constitution of the molecule. The final step is to apply the correct numbering rule.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\n*   **Rule 1: Lowest Locants.** We start at C1 (-COOH). We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   Clockwise numbering gives the substituent locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering also gives the locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since both directions give the same set of locants, we must use a tie-breaker rule.\n*   **Rule 2 (Tie-breaker): Alphabetical Priority.** When the locant set is identical, we give the lowest possible number to the substituent group that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents**\n\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   Cyano\n*   Dimethylamino\n*   Formyl (for the -CHO group)\n*   Hydroxy\n*   Methoxy\n\nIn alphabetical order, they are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nThe first group alphabetically is **cyano**. Therefore, we must choose the numbering direction that assigns the lowest number to the cyano group.\n\n*   **Numbering Direction 1 (from Case 1):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH. The cyano group is at **C5**.\n*   **Numbering Direction 2 (from Case 2):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2. The cyano group is at **C3**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering is the one from Direction 2.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\n\nUsing the correct numbering (C3-cyano), we list the substituents alphabetically with their locants:\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino) - parenthesis is used for complex substituents like dimethylamino.\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\", we get the full IUPAC name:\n\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\n\nFirst, we list all the functional groups present on the benzene ring:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, referred to as the 'formyl' group when a substituent)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules for priority of functional groups, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as locant number 1 (C1).\n\n**2. Place the Substituents on the Benzene Ring based on the Description**\n\nLet's map out the positions of the other groups relative to C1:\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4.\n    *   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   One of {C2, C6} is -OH (hydroxyl).\n    *   The other of {C2, C6} is -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino).\n\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: The carboxylic acid is at C1. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups must be at C3 and C5. Since C3 and C5 are also meta to each other, this condition is satisfied.\n    *   One of {C3, C5} is -CHO (formyl).\n    *   The other of {C3, C5} is -CN (cyano).\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\"**: This is the key clue to resolve the ambiguities. The nitrile group is -CN.\n    *   We know methoxy (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The -CN group must be ortho to C4, which means the -CN group must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) must also be ortho to the -CN group.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group's position:\n        *   **Scenario A: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. We know -OCH3 is at C4, which fits. This would mean the -OH group must be at C6.\n        *   **Scenario B: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. We know -OCH3 is at C4, which fits. This would mean the -OH group must be at C2.\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Numbering (Lowest Locant Rule)**\n\nWe now have two possible structures that fit the description. The next step is to number the ring according to IUPAC rules to decide which structure is correct. The primary rule is to assign numbers to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\nIn both scenarios, the substituents are located at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Since this set of locants is the same for both possibilities, we have a tie.\nThe tie-breaking rule states that when a choice exists, numbering should be assigned to give the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent names alphabetically:\n1.  **C**yano\n2.  **D**imethylamino\n3.  **F**ormyl\n4.  **H**ydroxy\n5.  **M**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**. Therefore, the numbering should be chosen to give the 'cyano' group the lowest possible number (either 3 or 5). Since 3 is lower than 5, the cyano group must be at **C3**.\n\nThis confirms **Scenario B** is the correct one.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Structure**\n\nBased on our deductions, the positions are:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (Since -CN is at C3, -OH must be at C2 to be ortho to it)\n*   **C3:** -CN (Gets the lower number, 3, based on alphabetization)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3\n*   **C5:** -CHO (The other meta position for the remaining group)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (The other ortho position for the remaining group)\n\n**5. Construct the IUPAC Name**\n\nNow, we assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)** (The parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name perfectly matches option B. Let's verify the other options:\n*   A) Not alphabetized correctly.\n*   C) This name corresponds to our rejected \"Scenario A\" where cyano is at C5, violating the lowest locant rule for alphabetically first substituent.\n*   D) Not alphabetized correctly.\n\nThus, the only correct IUPAC name based on the description and rules is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is my reasoning and thinking process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, I will break down the description to place each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Base Structure:** A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) all *meta* to one another. The simplest way to draw this is to place the main group, the carboxylic acid, at position 1. Then, the other two groups would be at positions 3 and 5 to satisfy the *meta* relationship (1,3- and 1,5- relationships are meta; 3,5- is also meta).\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C3: -CHO (Carbaldehyde/Formyl)\n    *   C5: -CN (Cyano)\n\n2.  **Add Substituents Relative to the Carboxylic Acid:**\n    *   *Ortho* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, these two groups are at C2 and C6, but we don't know which is which yet.\n    *   *Para* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) is a methoxy group (-OCH3). The para position is C4. So, the -OCH3 group is at C4.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Resolve Ambiguity:**\n    *   The description states: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) group is at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   We already placed the methoxy (-OCH3) group at C4, which is consistent with this statement.\n    *   Therefore, the alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) group must be at the other ortho position, C6.\n    *   This means the remaining ortho-to-COOH position, C2, must be occupied by the dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group.\n\nThe final structure is now unambiguously determined:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxyl)\n\n### 2. Determine the Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules for functional groups, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority among all the groups present. Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted **benzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Number the Benzene Ring\n\n*   The carbon atom bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) is assigned **locant 1**.\n*   We need to number the remaining positions (2 through 6) to give the lowest possible set of locants to the other substituents. We can number either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Numbering clockwise:** Substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   **Numbering counter-clockwise:** Starting from C1, C6 would become C2, C5 would become C3, etc. The substituents would still be at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n*   Since both directions yield the same locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use a tie-breaker rule. The rule states that we assign numbering to give the lowest locants to substituents cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n### 4. Alphabetize the Substituents\n\nLet's list the substituents and alphabetize them. Note that when naming, the carbaldehyde group (-CHO) is named \"formyl\" and the nitrile group (-CN) is named \"cyano\".\n*   -CN: **c**yano\n*   -N(CH3)2: **d**imethylamino\n*   -CHO: **f**ormyl\n*   -OH: **h**ydroxy\n*   -OCH3: **m**ethoxy\n\nThe alphabetical order is: **cyano**, **dimethylamino**, **formyl**, **hydroxy**, **methoxy**.\n\n### 5. Apply the Numbering Tie-Breaker\n\nNow, let's compare the two numbering schemes based on the position of the alphabetically first substituent, \"cyano\".\n\n*   **Clockwise Numbering:** Based on our drawing, the -N(CH3)2 is at C2 and the **-CN is at C5**.\n*   **Counter-clockwise Numbering:** The -OH would be at C2 and the **-CN would be at C3**.\n\nSince **3 is lower than 5**, the counter-clockwise numbering scheme is correct.\n\nThe correct locants for each substituent are:\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)**\n\n### 6. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nWe list the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants, and finish with the parent name.\n\n1.  3-cyano-\n2.  6-(dimethylamino)-\n3.  5-formyl-\n4.  2-hydroxy-\n5.  4-methoxy-\n6.  benzoic acid\n\nCombining these in the correct order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 7. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical ordering in the name)\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical ordering in the name)\n*   D) **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** (Matches our derived name)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Chemical Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to build a model of the molecule.\n-   **Core:** A benzene ring.\n-   **Highest Priority Group:** The problem lists a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which, according to IUPAC rules, is the highest priority among the given functional groups. This means the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n-   **Substituent Positions relative to C1 (-COOH):**\n    -   *ortho* (C2 and C6): one hydroxyl (-OH) group and one dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group.\n    -   *para* (C4): one methoxy (-OCH₃) group.\n-   **Meta-related groups:** The carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group are all *meta* to one another. This means they are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the ring. Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n-   **Final constraint for positioning:** The methoxy group (-OCH₃) and the alcohol/hydroxyl group (-OH) are both *ortho* (adjacent) to the nitrile/cyano group (-CN).\n\nLet's use this information to determine the exact position of each substituent.\n1.  Place -COOH at **C1**.\n2.  Place -OCH₃ at **C4** (para to C1).\n3.  The -CHO and -CN groups are at **C3** and **C5**.\n4.  The -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ groups are at **C2** and **C6**.\n5.  Now use the final constraint: -OCH₃ (at C4) and -OH are ortho to -CN.\n    -   The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So -CN must be at C3 or C5, which is consistent.\n    -   Let's test if **-CN is at C3**. The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n    -   Let's test if **-CN is at C5**. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C6. This also works.\n\nWe have two potential arrangements which are actually the same molecule, just numbered differently from C1:\n-   **Arrangement A (Numbering Counter-Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n-   **Arrangement B (Numbering Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH\n\n### 2. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nThe principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We must number the remaining carbons to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants (numbers).\n-   In both Arrangement A and Arrangement B, the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n-   When the locant sets are identical, IUPAC rules state that we must give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nNow let's compare the two numbering arrangements based on the position of the alphabetically first substituent, \"cyano\":\n-   In Arrangement A (counter-clockwise), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n-   In Arrangement B (clockwise), the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the counter-clockwise numbering of Arrangement A is correct.\n\nSo, the correct assignment of substituents is:\n-   C1: -COOH\n-   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n-   C3: -CN (cyano)\n-   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n-   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n-   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n\n### 3. Assemble the Final Name\n\nTo write the final IUPAC name, list the substituents (with their locants) in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for clarity with complex/substituted substituents)\n3.  **5-formyl**\n4.  **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these parts alphabetically gives the name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 4. Compare with the Given Options\n\n-   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering.*\n-   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - *Correct numbering, but prefixes are listed numerically, not alphabetically.*\n-   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *This exactly matches our derived name.*\n-   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering and incorrect alphabetical order.*\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a systematic approach to IUPAC nomenclature. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Identify Substituents and the Parent Ring\n*   **Parent Ring**: Benzene\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents**:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as a 'formyl' prefix.\n    *   Cyano (-CN), named as a 'cyano' prefix.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as a 'hydroxy' prefix.\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\n### 2. Determine the Principal Functional Group\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the functional groups are ranked as follows:\nCarboxylic acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether.\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. This makes the parent molecule a **benzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Draw the Structure and Number the Ring\n\n1.  **Assign C1**: The carbon atom attached to the principal group (-COOH) is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Place the other groups based on the description**:\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": Methoxy (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ groups are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n3.  **Use the final clue to fix the positions**:\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\".\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile group (-CN) must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   If the -CN group were at C5, its ortho positions would be C4 and C6.\n    *   If the -CN group were at C3, its ortho positions would be C2 and C4.\n    *   The description states that both the methoxy (-OCH₃ at C4) and the alcohol/hydroxyl (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile. This is only possible if the **nitrile (-CN) is at C3**, which puts the **hydroxyl (-OH) at C2**.\n\n4.  **Finalize the Structure**:\n    *   **C1**: -COOH\n    *   **C2**: -OH (ortho to -COOH and ortho to -CN)\n    *   **C3**: -CN (meta to -COOH and ortho to -OCH₃ and -OH)\n    *   **C4**: -OCH₃ (para to -COOH and ortho to -CN)\n    *   **C5**: This leaves the remaining meta position for the carbaldehyde (-CHO).\n    *   **C6**: This leaves the remaining ortho position for the dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group.\n\n    The structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (Hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino)\n\n    This structure and numbering scheme satisfies all the conditions described in the question.\n\n### 4. Assemble the IUPAC Name\n\n1.  **Alphabetize the prefixes**: The prefixes must be listed in alphabetical order, not numerical order.\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n\n2.  **Combine prefixes with their locants and the parent name**:\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are often used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This exactly matches our derived name.\n*   B) This option uses incorrect numbering.\n*   C) This option incorrectly orders the substituents numerically instead of alphabetically.\n*   D) This option uses incorrect locants.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Molecule**\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to build a structural representation of the molecule. We will use a temporary numbering system on a benzene ring to place the groups, which may not be the final IUPAC numbering.\n\n*   **Core structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main groups:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group are all *meta* (1,3-positions) to one another. Let's place the primary functional group, the carboxylic acid, at position 1. This means the other two groups are at positions 3 and 5.\n    *   -COOH at C1\n    *   -CHO at C3\n    *   -CN at C5\n\n    ```\n        (C1)-COOH\n       /      \\\n     C6        C2\n    /          \\\n   (C5)-CN -- C4 -- (C3)-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Substituents relative to the carboxylic acid:**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* (1,2-positions) to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* (1,4-position) to the carboxylic acid. This places it at C4.\n\n    Let's update the drawing with this information:\n    ```\n          (C1)-COOH\n         /         \\\n    (C6)-(OH/NMe2) (C2)-(NMe2/OH)\n      |                |\n    (C5)-CN -------- (C4)-OCH3 -------- (C3)-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Final positioning clue:** The methoxy group and the alcohol group (-OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile group (-CN).\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is at C5. The positions *ortho* to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is already at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This confirms its placement.\n    *   Therefore, the alcohol (-OH) must be at the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   This forces the remaining dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group to be at C2.\n\n**The final, unambiguous structure is:**\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxy)\n\n**2. Determine the Parent Compound and IUPAC Numbering**\n\n*   **Parent Compound:** The IUPAC priority of functional groups is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > ... > Alcohol > Amine > Ether. The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest priority group, so the parent name is **benzoic acid**.\n*   **Numbering:**\n    *   The carbon atom bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) must be assigned locant 1 (C1).\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** C1-COOH, C2-NMe2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH. The locant set for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-NMe2. The locant set for the substituents is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Tie-breaker rule:** When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, we choose the scheme that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n**3. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Alphabetize the substituents:**\n    1.  **C**yano\n    2.  **D**imethylamino\n    3.  **F**ormyl (the prefix for a -CHO group when it's not the principal group)\n    4.  **H**ydroxy\n    5.  **M**ethoxy\n\n*   **Apply the tie-breaker:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering direction that gives the \"cyano\" group the lowest possible number.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering places the cyano group at C5.\n    *   Clockwise numbering places the cyano group at C3.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **we must use the clockwise numbering scheme**.\n\n*   **Assign the correct locants based on clockwise numbering:**\n    *   **hydroxy** is at C2\n    *   **cyano** is at C3\n    *   **methoxy** is at C4\n    *   **formyl** is at C5\n    *   **dimethylamino** is at C6\n\n*   **Construct the name:** List the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its correct locant, and then add the parent name.\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together, the correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**4.
