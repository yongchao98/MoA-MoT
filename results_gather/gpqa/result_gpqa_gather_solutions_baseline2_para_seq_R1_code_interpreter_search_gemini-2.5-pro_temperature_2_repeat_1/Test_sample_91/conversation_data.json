Let's summarize the steps and verify the result.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Bond Count:**\n    *   The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    *   The molecular formula is C12H22.\n    *   Number of C-H bonds = 22.\n    *   Number of C=C bonds = 2.\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = 9.\n\n2.  **Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants (Elements):**\n    *   The formation reaction is `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22`.\n    *   Energy to atomize reactants = (12 * ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 * BE(H-H))\n    *   Energy = (12 * 1000) + (11 * 100) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n3.  **Enthalpy of Atomization of Product (Compound):**\n    *   This is the energy required to break all bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Energy = (9 * BE(C-C)) + (2 * BE(C=C)) + (22 * BE(C-H))\n    *   Energy = (9 * 200) + (2 * 300) + (22 * 400) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ**.\n\n4.  **Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):**\n    *   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants) - (Enthalpy of Atomization of Product)\n    *   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n5.  **Conversion to kJ/g:**\n    *   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n    *   ΔH_f (per gram) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThe Python code output confirms these calculations:\n*   Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\n*   Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.424... (The slight difference is due to using more precise atomic masses in the code).\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 11.44 kJ/g matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe chemical formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nFirst, we count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Bonds**\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`=`), so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms is one less than the number of carbon atoms. Total C atoms = 12, so there are 12 - 1 = 11 bonds in the carbon skeleton. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3.

Option A has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). We need to convert our result to kJ/g to check option B.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    Molar Mass = (12 * Atomic Mass of C) + (22 * Atomic Mass of H)\n    Using approximate integer masses: 12 * 12 g/mol + 22 * 1 g/mol = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

For this, we need the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂.\n\n*   Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂ = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn enthalpy of formation calculation involves determining the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.

Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\n*   **Molecule:** (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = **12 C**\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = **22 H**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₂H₂₂\n\nNow, we count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds. There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   2 bonds in (CH₃)₂C=\n    *   1 bond between =CH- and -CH₂-\n    *   1 bond between -CH₂- and -CH(CH₃)-\n    *   1 bond in -CH(CH₃)- (to the methyl group)\n    *   1 bond between -CH(CH₃)- and -CH₂-\n    *   1 bond between -CH₂- and -CH=\n    *   2 bonds in =C(CH₃)₂\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**2.

Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy released when all the gaseous atoms (12 C and 22 H) combine to form one mole of the gaseous compound. This is equal to the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total bond energy (ΔH₂)** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the net energy change of the process.\nΔH_f° = (Energy input to atomize elements) - (Energy released from forming bonds)\nΔH_f° = ΔH₁ - ΔH₂\nΔH_f° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g to Match Options**\n\nThe calculated molar enthalpy is 1900 kJ/mol. Options C and D are given in kJ/g.

The slight difference is due to rounding or the exact atomic masses used.\n\nThe code output also confirms the calculation:\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): 11.42\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires calculating the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of a given organic molecule. The standard way to do this using the provided data (bond energies and enthalpies of atomization) is to follow Hess's law. The overall formation reaction can be thought of as a two-step process:\n\n1.  Atomization of the elements in their standard states to form gaseous atoms.\n2.  Combination of these gaseous atoms to form one mole of the gaseous compound.\n\nThe formula for the enthalpy of formation is:\n**ΔHf = [Σ (Enthalpies of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nHere's a detailed step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecule's Structure and Composition**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the molecular formula and count the number of each type of chemical bond in the molecule: **(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2**.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms: 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (=C<) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH-) + 1 (in the branch -CH3) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (=C<) + 2 (in the final (CH3)2) = **12 C atoms**.\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms: 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H atoms**.\n    *   So, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Counting:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** Let's count them carefully from the structure:\n        *   Two `CH3` groups are attached to the first double-bonded carbon: 2 C-C bonds.\n        *   The bond between `=CH-` and `-CH2-`: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   The bond between `-CH2-` and `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   The branch `-CH3` on the `-CH-` group: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   The bond between `-CH(CH3)-` and `-CH2-`: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   The bond between `-CH2-` and `-CH=`: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   Two `CH3` groups are attached to the last double-bonded carbon: 2 C-C bonds.\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert these reactants into gaseous atoms:\n*   **For Carbon:** 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    *   Energy = 12 mol × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 × 1000 kJ = **12000 kJ**\n*   **For Hydrogen:** 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    *   Energy = 11 mol × Bond Energy(H-H) = 11 × 100 kJ = **1100 kJ**\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization for reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Sum of Bond Energies in the Product Molecule**\n\nThis is equivalent to the enthalpy of atomization of the compound C12H22. It's the energy released when the molecule is formed from its gaseous atoms, or equivalently, the energy required to break all its bonds.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n\nTotal bond energy in the product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nNow, we apply the main formula:\nΔHf = [Σ (Enthalpies of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **Step 5: Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g and kJ/mol.

Determine the Molecular Formula and Count the Bonds**\nThe molecule is (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.\n*   **Carbon (C) Atoms**: 2 (from (CH₃)₂) + 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (CH₂) + 2 (CH(CH₃)) + 1 (CH₂) + 1 (CH=) + 3 (=C(CH₃)₂) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) Atoms**: 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₂H₂₂\n\nNext, we count the types of bonds:\n*   **C-H Bonds**: There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C Bonds**: There are two double bonds visible in the structure, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C Bonds**: For an acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-to-carbon bonds is `(number of C atoms) - 1`. So, 12 - 1 = 11 total C-C links. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\nThe formation of the compound from its elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\n\nThe energy required to turn these reactants into gaseous atoms is:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of C: `12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to break bonds in 11 moles of H₂: `11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Energy for Reactant Atomization = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ**\n\n**3.

Option A has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). We need to convert our result to kJ/g to check option B.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    Molar Mass = (12 * Atomic Mass of C) + (22 * Atomic Mass of H)\n    Using approximate integer masses: 12 * 12 g/mol + 22 * 1 g/mol = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Calculating the Enthalpy of Atomization (ΔH_atom)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) can be calculated using the following relationship:\nΔH_f = (Σ Enthalpies of atomization of reactants) - (Σ Bond energies of products)\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization for Reactants**\n    The formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n    12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\n\n    The energy required to turn these reactants into gaseous atoms is:\n    *   Energy for Carbon: 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   Energy for Hydrogen: 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   **Total Reactant Atomization Enthalpy = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ**\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization for the Product (the molecule)**\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous product.\n    *   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n    *   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   **Total Product Atomization Enthalpy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ** (This corresponds to option D, but it's not the final answer).\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we combine the results from Step 3.\nΔH_f = (Total Reactant Atomization Enthalpy) - (Total Product Atomization Enthalpy)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **5. Unit Conversion**\n\nThe calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. We must check the options.\n*   A) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect)\n*   B) 1900 kJ/g (Incorrect unit, though the numerical value matches our intermediate result)\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g\n*   D) 11200 kJ/mol (Incorrect, this is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\n\nSince option C is given in kJ/g, we need to convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. For this, we need the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂.\n\n*   Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂ = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn enthalpy of formation calculation involves determining the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.

There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   2 bonds in (CH₃)₂C=\n    *   1 bond between =CH- and -CH₂-\n    *   1 bond between -CH₂- and -CH(CH₃)-\n    *   1 bond in -CH(CH₃)- (to the methyl group)\n    *   1 bond between -CH(CH₃)- and -CH₂-\n    *   1 bond between -CH₂- and -CH=\n    *   2 bonds in =C(CH₃)₂\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (12 moles of C(graphite) and 11 moles of H₂(gas)) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of C(gas) and 22 moles of H(gas)).\n\n*   Formation of 12 moles of C(g): 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Formation of 22 moles of H(g) from 11 moles of H₂(g): 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total energy input (ΔH₁)** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy released when all the gaseous atoms (12 C and 22 H) combine to form one mole of the gaseous compound. This is equal to the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total bond energy (ΔH₂)** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the net energy change of the process.\nΔH_f° = (Energy input to atomize elements) - (Energy released from forming bonds)\nΔH_f° = ΔH₁ - ΔH₂\nΔH_f° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g to Match Options**\n\nThe calculated molar enthalpy is 1900 kJ/mol. Options C and D are given in kJ/g. We need to convert our result.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂:**\n    *   M = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   M ≈ (12 × 12.01 g/mol) + (22 × 1.01 g/mol) ≈ 144.12 + 22.22 = 166.34 g/mol\n*   **Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔH_f° (kJ/g) = ΔH_f° (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔH_f° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166.34 g/mol ≈ **11.42 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C. The slight difference is due to rounding or the exact atomic masses used.\n\nThe code output also confirms the calculation:\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): 11.42\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires calculating the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of a given organic molecule. The standard way to do this using the provided data (bond energies and enthalpies of atomization) is to follow Hess's law. The overall formation reaction can be thought of as a two-step process:\n\n1.  Atomization of the elements in their standard states to form gaseous atoms.\n2.  Combination of these gaseous atoms to form one mole of the gaseous compound.\n\nThe formula for the enthalpy of formation is:\n**ΔHf = [Σ (Enthalpies of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nHere's a detailed step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecule's Structure and Composition**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the molecular formula and count the number of each type of chemical bond in the molecule: **(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2**.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms: 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (=C<) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH-) + 1 (in the branch -CH3) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (=C<) + 2 (in the final (CH3)2) = **12 C atoms**.\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms: 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H atoms**.\n    *   So, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Counting:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** Let's count them carefully from the structure:\n        *   Two `CH3` groups are attached to the first double-bonded carbon: 2 C-C bonds.\n        *   The bond between `=CH-` and `-CH2-`: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   The bond between `-CH2-` and `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   The branch `-CH3` on the `-CH-` group: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   The bond between `-CH(CH3)-` and `-CH2-`: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   The bond between `-CH2-` and `-CH=`: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   Two `CH3` groups are attached to the last double-bonded carbon: 2 C-C bonds.\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert these reactants into gaseous atoms:\n*   **For Carbon:** 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    *   Energy = 12 mol × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 × 1000 kJ = **12000 kJ**\n*   **For Hydrogen:** 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    *   Energy = 11 mol × Bond Energy(H-H) = 11 × 100 kJ = **1100 kJ**\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization for reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Sum of Bond Energies in the Product Molecule**\n\nThis is equivalent to the enthalpy of atomization of the compound C12H22. It's the energy released when the molecule is formed from its gaseous atoms, or equivalently, the energy required to break all its bonds.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n\nTotal bond energy in the product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nNow, we apply the main formula:\nΔHf = [Σ (Enthalpies of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **Step 5: Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g and kJ/mol.
