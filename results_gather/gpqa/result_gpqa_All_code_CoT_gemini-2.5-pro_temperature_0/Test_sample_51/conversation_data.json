    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Equation:** The problem asks for the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels at different temperatures. Since the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann equation is the appropriate tool. The ratio of the population of a higher energy level (N2) to a lower energy level (N1) is given by:\n    `N2 / N1 = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `g2` and `g1` are statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Factor:** We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. This is the ratio in the \"no spots\" case divided by the ratio in the \"with spots\" case.\n    *   `Ratio_nospots = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))`\n    *   `Ratio_spots = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n    *   `Factor = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`\n\n    When we divide these two expressions, the statistical weight term `(g2 / g1)` cancels out. Using the properties of exponents (`exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`), we get:\n    `Factor = exp( (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) )`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength (λ). The formula is `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n4.  **Identify the Temperatures:** The problem provides the effective temperatures for the two scenarios, which we will use as the characteristic temperatures for the photosphere in the Boltzmann equation.\n    *   `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spots = 5500 K`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:** We will write a Python script to define the constants (`h`, `c`, `k`), plug in the given values for `λ`, `T_nospots`, and `T_spots`, and calculate the final factor. The other information, such as the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage, is not needed for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J.s\nc = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23    # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Step 2: Define the given parameters from the problem\n# Wavelength of the transition in Angstroms\nlambda_angstrom = 1448.0\n# Temperature of the star's photosphere without spots in Kelvin\nT_nospots = 6000.0\n# Overall effective temperature of the star's photosphere with spots in Kelvin\nT_spots = 5500.0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the energy difference (delta_E)\n# Convert wavelength from Angstroms to meters\nlambda_meters = lambda_angstrom * 1e-10\n# Calculate energy difference using E = hc/lambda\ndelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_meters\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the factor using the Boltzmann equation ratio\n# The factor is Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots, which simplifies to:\n# Factor = exp( (-delta_E / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) )\nexponent = (-delta_E / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated factor is: {factor:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nAvailable choices:\")\nprint(\"A) ~1.1\")\nprint(\"B) ~2.9\")\nprint(\"C) ~4.5\")\nprint(\"D) ~7.8\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
