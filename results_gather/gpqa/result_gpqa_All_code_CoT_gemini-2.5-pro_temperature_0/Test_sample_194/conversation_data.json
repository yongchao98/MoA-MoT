    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the maximum possible orbital period for a second planet (Planet 2) in the system, with the condition that it must still produce both transits and occultations.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Conditions for Transit/Occultation:**\n    *   A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star. An occultation is when it passes behind. For a circular orbit, if a transit happens, an occultation will also happen half an orbit later.\n    *   The key parameter governing a transit is the impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance between the planet's center and the star's center during the transit, measured in units of the star's radius.\n    *   For the center of the planet to pass across the star's disk, the impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1 (`b <= 1`). This is the limiting condition for a transit to occur (specifically, a non-grazing transit). We will use `b_max = 1` as the condition for the outermost possible transiting orbit for Planet 2.\n\n3.  **Relate the Two Planets:**\n    *   The problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane. This is a crucial piece of information, as it means their orbital inclination (`i`) with respect to our line of sight is the same.\n    *   The formula for the impact parameter is `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit and `R_star` is the stellar radius.\n    *   For Planet 1: `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_star`.\n    *   For Planet 2: `b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_star`.\n    *   By taking the ratio of these two equations, we can eliminate the unknown `cos(i)` and the constant `R_star`: `b2 / b1 = a2 / a1`.\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`): `P² ∝ a³`.\n    *   For the two planets orbiting the same star, we can write this as a ratio: `(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Solve:**\n    *   We want to find the maximum period for Planet 2 (`P2_max`). This will correspond to its maximum possible semi-major axis (`a2_max`), which in turn corresponds to its maximum allowed impact parameter (`b2_max = 1`).\n    *   First, find the ratio of the semi-major axes: `a2_max / a1 = b2_max / b1 = 1 / b1`.\n    *   Now, substitute this into the Kepler's Law equation: `(P2_max / P1)² = (1 / b1)³`.\n    *   Finally, solve for `P2_max`: `P2_max = P1 * (1 / b1)^(3/2)`.\n\n    *Note: The radii of the star and the planets are not needed for the final calculation under the `b_max = 1` assumption, which is a common simplification for this type of problem and leads directly to one of the answers.*\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters for the first planet\nP1_days = 3.0  # Orbital period of Planet 1 in days\nb1 = 0.2       # Transit impact parameter of Planet 1\n\n# The condition for the second planet to transit is that its impact parameter, b2,\n# must be less than or equal to 1 (meaning its center passes over the stellar disk).\n# The maximum possible period occurs at the maximum possible impact parameter.\nb2_max = 1.0\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1) is equal to the ratio of the impact parameters (b2/b1)\n# because the planets share the same orbital plane (same inclination 'i') and orbit the same star.\n# a2_max / a1 = b2_max / b1\naxis_ratio = b2_max / b1\n\n# According to Kepler's Third Law, (P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3.\n# We can solve for the maximum period of the second planet, P2_max.\n# P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)\nP2_max_days = P1_days * (axis_ratio ** 1.5)\n\n# Print the final result and the available choices\nprint(f\"The maximum orbital period of the second planet is: {P2_max_days:.1f} days\")\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 12.5\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 7.5\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 33.5\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 37.5\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
