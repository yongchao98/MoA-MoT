    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak at `3400–2500 cm-1` is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at `1720 cm-1` corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1` indicate the presence of a C=C bond in an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   The remaining signals (`2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`) must describe the other substituent on the ring. Let's piece it together:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` is a -CH3 group next to a -CH2 group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` is a -CH2 group next to the -CH3 and a -CH group. This confirms an ethyl fragment (-CH2CH3).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` is a -CH3 group next to a -CH group.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is a -CH group attached to the benzene ring, the ethyl group, and the methyl group.\n        *   Assembling these fragments gives a `sec-butyl` group: -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3).\n    *   Conclusion from NMR: The compound has a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\n*   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   The reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The sec-butyl group at position 4 is an alkyl group and is unaffected by the reaction.\n*   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n\nThe calculated product, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, matches option (B).\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product of the reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analysis of the starting material (Compound X)\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the starting material (Compound X)\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"IR Data Analysis:\")\n    print(\" - 3400–2500 cm-1 (broad): O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\" - 1720 cm-1 (strong): C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\" - 1610 & 1450 cm-1: C=C stretches of an aromatic ring.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"1H NMR Data Analysis:\")\n    print(\" - 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\")\n    print(\" - 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) & 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\")\n    print(\" - The remaining signals describe a sec-butyl group [-CH(CH3)(CH2CH3)].\")\n    print(\"Conclusion from NMR: Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analysis of the reaction\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the reaction\")\n    print(\"------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Reagents: Red Phosphorus (Red P) and Hydroiodic Acid (HI).\")\n    print(\"Reaction Type: This is a strong reduction reaction.\")\n    print(\"Effect: This combination reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH3).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Determining the final product\n    print(\"Step 3: Determining the final product\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\")\n    print(\"Transformation: The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH3 group.\")\n    print(\"Final Product: The resulting molecule is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Matching with options\n    print(\"Step 4: Matching with the given options\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\")\n    print(\"B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\")\n    print(\"C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\")\n    print(\"D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final product, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, corresponds to option B.\")\n\n# Execute the analysis\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\nprint(\"<<<B>>>\")\n```"
