    "My plan is to solve this multi-step synthesis and spectroscopy problem by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the structure of Product 1:** The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The reaction with hot KOH and the resulting IR spectrum (1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a ketone) strongly suggest that Product 1 is **adamantanone**. The provided NMR data for Product 1 seems inconsistent with this structure and may be erroneous or a red herring; the IR data is more definitive for the functional group.\n\n2.  **Determine the structure of Product 3:** The overall reaction sequence must be chemically logical. Step 3 is an ozonolysis, which cleaves a C=C double bond. This means Product 2 must be an alkene. Step 2 supposedly converts the ketone (Product 1) into this alkene (Product 2). While the given reagent, aluminum isopropoxide, typically causes reduction, for the problem to be solvable, we must infer the intended transformation. A common way to convert a ketone to an alkene is a Wittig reaction. If we assume an appropriate reaction (like a Wittig) converts adamantanone to **2-methyleneadamantane** (Product 2), then ozonolysis in Step 3 would cleave the C=CH₂ bond, regenerating **adamantanone**. Therefore, Product 3 is adamantanone.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3 (Adamantanone):** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n    *   In adamantanone, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons alpha to the carbonyl group (at positions C-1 and C-3).\n    *   Let's analyze the coupling of the proton at C-1. It is coupled to the protons on the two adjacent methylene (CH₂) groups at C-8 and C-9.\n    *   Due to the molecule's rigid, symmetric structure, the four neighboring protons on these two CH₂ groups are not all equivalent. They form two distinct sets of two equivalent protons.\n    *   Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons would produce a triplet (based on the n+1 rule).\n    *   This triplet is then split again by the second pair of equivalent protons, also into a triplet.\n    *   The resulting theoretical pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n4.  **Select the final answer:** Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n# The problem describes a three-step synthesis. While there are some ambiguities\n# in the reaction descriptions, a logical deduction points to a specific final product.\n# - Reaction 1 (1,3-dibromoadamantane -> Product 1): The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is\n#   characteristic of a ketone in a strained ring. This strongly indicates that\n#   Product 1 is adamantanone.\n# - Reaction 2 & 3 (Product 1 -> Product 2 -> Product 3): Step 3 is ozonolysis,\n#   which requires an alkene (Product 2). For the overall problem to be consistent,\n#   the sequence must lead to a final product whose NMR can be analyzed. The most\n#   plausible pathway is one where ozonolysis regenerates the initial ketone.\n#   This means Product 2 is likely 2-methyleneadamantane, and Product 3 is adamantanone.\nfinal_product = \"Adamantanone\"\n\n# Step 2: Identify the most deshielded proton in the final product.\n# In adamantanone, the protons alpha to the carbonyl group are the most deshielded.\n# These are the two equivalent bridgehead protons (CH) at positions C1 and C3.\nmost_deshielded_proton_location = \"Alpha-bridgehead proton (e.g., at C1)\"\n\n# Step 3: Determine the coupling pattern of this proton.\n# The proton at C1 is coupled to the protons on the two adjacent methylene (CH2) groups.\n# In the rigid adamantane cage, these four neighboring protons are not all equivalent.\n# Due to the molecule's symmetry, they can be grouped into two pairs of equivalent protons.\n# - Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons gives a triplet (n=2, so n+1=3).\n# - This signal is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons,\n#   also resulting in a triplet.\n# The final pattern is therefore a triplet of triplets.\ncoupling_pattern = \"triplet of triplets\"\nfinal_choice = \"D\"\n\n# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final answer.\nprint(\"Analysis of the problem:\")\nprint(f\"1. The final product (Product 3) is determined to be {final_product}.\")\nprint(f\"2. The most deshielded proton is the {most_deshielded_proton_location}.\")\nprint(f\"3.
