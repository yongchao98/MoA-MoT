    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity (K):** The Doppler effect tells us that the observed shift in a spectral line's wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity of the source (the star, in this case). Therefore, the amplitude of the velocity variation, known as the RV semi-amplitude (K), is proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude (K) of its host star is given by a formula derived from Kepler's and Newton's laws. The key relationship for our problem is:\n    *   `K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)`\n    *   This relationship holds true because the problem states that the masses of the stars are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the masses of the planets are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). We also assume the orbital inclinations are comparable for this analysis.\n    *   From this proportionality, we can write the ratio: `K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`.\n\n3.  **Combine and Solve for the Period Ratio (T₂ / T₁):** We now have two different expressions for the same ratio, `K₂ / K₁`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    *   `Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for our target ratio, `T₂ / T₁`, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   `(Δλ₂ / Δλ₁)^3 = T₁ / T₂`\n    *   Finally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get the desired ratio:\n    *   `T₂ / T₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We will now plug the given values into the formula and calculate the result.\n    *   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom\n    *   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5  # Wavelength shift for planet #1 in miliangstrom\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7  # Wavelength shift for planet #2 in miliangstrom\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is related to the ratio of the\n# wavelength shifts (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) to the power of 3.\n# T2 / T1 = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)^3\nperiod_ratio = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) ** 3\n\n# The available choices\nchoices = {\n    \"A\": 0.85,\n    \"B\": 1.40,\n    \"C\": 0.36,\n    \"D\": 1.96\n}\n\n# Print the calculated result and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the orbital periods (T2 / T1) is: {period_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ {choices['A']}\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ {choices['B']}\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ {choices['C']}\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ {choices['D']}\")\n\n# Determine the closest choice\nclosest_choice = min(choices, key=lambda k: abs(choices[k] - period_ratio))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
