    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound is likely a carboxylic acid that also contains a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12.01 for C + 16.00 for O + 16.00 for O + 1.01 for H ≈ 45).\n    *   *Conclusion from MS:* This strongly supports the conclusion that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we know the compound must be a carboxylic acid (containing a -COOH group) and must also contain a C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n    *   We are left with B (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).\n    *   Now, let's use the concept of the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to distinguish between B and C. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   We know our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means the correct formula must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **Option B (C6H12O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. It cannot also have a C=C double bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option C (C6H10O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. This option is consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The unknown compound must have the formula C6H10O2.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H10O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H12O\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the spectroscopic data step-by-step:\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze FTIR and Mass Spec data for functional groups\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Analyze FTIR and Mass Spectrometry data.\")\n    print(\" - FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 cm-1 (O-H stretch) and strong peak at 1700 cm-1 (C=O stretch).\")\n    print(\" - Mass Spec: Fragment at m/z = 45, which corresponds to the [COOH]+ fragment.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The compound is a carboxylic acid, so it must contain two oxygen atoms.\")\n\n    # Filter options based on the number of oxygen atoms\n    possible_options_step1 = {k: v for k, v in options.items() if 'O2' in v}\n    print(f\"Filtering out options without 2 oxygens.
