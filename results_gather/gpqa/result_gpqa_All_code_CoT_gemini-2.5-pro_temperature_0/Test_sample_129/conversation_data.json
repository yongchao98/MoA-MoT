    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the key physical principles:** The problem involves the concept of cosmological redshift and the limitations of ground-based optical astronomy.\n2.  **Define the constants:**\n    *   The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of hydrogen is `λ_rest ≈ 1216` Angstroms (Å). This is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n    *   Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most light with wavelengths shorter than about 3500 Å. This is our minimum observable wavelength, `λ_observed_min`.\n3.  **Formulate the equation:** The relationship between rest wavelength (`λ_rest`), observed wavelength (`λ_observed`), and redshift (`z`) is given by the formula:\n    `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n4.  **Set up the condition:** For the Lyα line to be detectable, its observed wavelength must be greater than or equal to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength:\n    `λ_observed ≥ λ_observed_min`\n    Substituting the redshift formula, we get:\n    `λ_rest * (1 + z) ≥ λ_observed_min`\n5.  **Solve for the lower limit of redshift (z):** We need to find the minimum `z` that satisfies this condition. We can rearrange the inequality to solve for `z`:\n    `1 + z ≥ λ_observed_min / λ_rest`\n    `z ≥ (λ_observed_min / λ_rest) - 1`\n6.  **Calculate the value:** We will plug the values for `λ_rest` and `λ_observed_min` into this formula to calculate the minimum required redshift.\n7.  **Compare with options:** The calculated value will be compared against the given choices to find the best estimate for the lower limit.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants\n# Rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms\nlambda_rest = 1216\n\n# Minimum wavelength observable by ground-based optical telescopes due to atmospheric cutoff (Angstroms)\n# This is the lower end of the visible spectrum accessible from the ground.\nlambda_observed_min = 3500\n\n# Calculate the lower limit on the redshift (z) using the formula:\n# z = (lambda_observed / lambda_rest) - 1\nz_min = (lambda_observed_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n# Print the calculated minimum redshift\nprint(f\"The rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha is {lambda_rest} Angstroms.\")\nprint(f\"The atmospheric cutoff for ground-based optical telescopes is approximately {lambda_observed_min} Angstroms.\")\nprint(f\"To be observed, the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted to at least this wavelength.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated lower limit on the redshift (z) is: {z_min:.2f}\")\n\n# Let's check the observed wavelength for each option to see which one is the most plausible lower limit.\noptions = {'A': 2.4, 'B': 3, 'C': 1.9, 'D': 1.2}\nprint(\"\\nChecking the observed wavelength for each option:\")\nfor choice, z_val in options.items():\n    observed_wavelength = lambda_rest * (1 + z_val)\n    print(f\"For option {choice}) z = {z_val}, the observed wavelength is {observed_wavelength:.1f} Angstroms.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated minimum redshift is approximately 1.88. Option C (1.9) is the closest value that places the Lyman-alpha line just within the observable range (~3526 Angstroms).\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: C\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
