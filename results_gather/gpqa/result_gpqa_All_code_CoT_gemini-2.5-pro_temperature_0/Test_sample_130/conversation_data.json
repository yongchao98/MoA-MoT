    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**: First, we need to determine the structures of the two starting materials.\n    *   **Dienophile**: The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This high degree of symmetry points to maleic acid, which dehydrates to form **maleic anhydride**. The NMR data is consistent: the two equivalent alkene protons give a single ¹H peak, and the two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons give two ¹³C peaks.\n    *   **Diene**: The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**: The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition typically yields two major stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The *endo* product, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are tucked under the newly formed ring, is usually the kinetically favored and thus the **major product**. The *exo* product is the **minor product**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Product Structures for NOESY Spectroscopy**: The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the spatial relationships between protons in the two products, which is what a 2D NOESY experiment reveals. A cross-peak in a NOESY spectrum indicates that two sets of protons are physically close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   **Proton Assignments**: Both products have a plane of symmetry. We can identify four main types of protons:\n        1.  **Me_vinyl**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm).\n        2.  **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm).\n        3.  **H_anhydride**: The two protons on the five-membered anhydride ring (2H singlet, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls to ~3.5 ppm).\n        4.  **H_bridge**: The two protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major)**: In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the **Me_vinyl** protons (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor)**: In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side of the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_vinyl** protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Instead, they are close to the **Me_bridgehead** protons.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. Based on our analysis, this specific interaction corresponds to the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons in the endo adduct. Matching our chemical shift and integration assignments to the options provided:\n    *   H_anhydride: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   Me_vinyl: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step 1: Define the problem and the options provided.\nproblem_description = \"\"\"\nA dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. \nThis anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, \nwas reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). \nBoth products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. \nA cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak?\n\"\"\"\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\",\n    \"B\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\",\n    \"C\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\",\n    \"D\": \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"\n}\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the reaction and products based on chemical principles.\n# Reactants: Maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n# Reaction: Diels-Alder.\n# Products: Endo (major) and Exo (minor) adducts.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the spatial proximity of protons for NOESY.\n# Proton types and estimated chemical shifts:\n# - Me_vinyl (vinylic methyls): 6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm\n# - Me_bridgehead (bridgehead methyls): 6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm\n# - H_anhydride (protons on anhydride ring): 2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm\n\n# NOE interactions:\n# - In the major (endo) product, H_anhydride protons are close to Me_vinyl protons.\n# - In the minor (exo) product, H_anhydride protons are far from Me_vinyl protons.\n\n# The question asks for the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor.\n# This corresponds to the interaction between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl.\n\n# Step 4: Match the interacting protons to the given options.\n# Interacting protons: H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet).\n# This matches the description in option B.\n\nfinal_answer = \"B\"\n\n# Step 5: Print the final answer.\nprint(f\"The reasoning leads to the conclusion that the cross-peak in the major product connects the vinylic methyl protons and the anhydride ring protons.\")\nprint(f\"Based on the provided options, the correct choice is:\")\nprint(f\"B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: {final_answer}\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
