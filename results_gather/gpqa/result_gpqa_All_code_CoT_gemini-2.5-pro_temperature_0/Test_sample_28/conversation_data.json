    "To determine which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the gene's protein product. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** First, we'll establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the original gene sequence into its amino acid sequence. The gene starts with `ATG` (the start codon) and ends with `TGA` (a stop codon).\n2.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** We will examine each mutant sequence to identify the type of mutation and its effect on the resulting protein.\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid, which might or might not disable the protein.\n    *   An **in-frame deletion/insertion** removes or adds an entire amino acid, which also might or might not disable the protein.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three) changes the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon, which terminates protein synthesis prematurely, resulting in a truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n3.  **Compare the Effects:** The most severe disruptions are frameshift and nonsense mutations, as they are most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. We will identify which mutant has the most disruptive mutation.\n\nLet's execute the analysis with Python.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_mutations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the DNA codon table for translation ('*' = STOP codon)\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M', 'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K', 'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V', 'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E', 'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S', 'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'*', 'TAG':'*', 'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'*', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n\n    def translate(seq):\n        protein = \"\"\n        for i in range(0, len(seq) - (len(seq) % 3), 3):\n            codon = seq[i:i+3]\n            amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown\n            if amino_acid == '*':\n                protein += '*'\n                break\n            protein += amino_acid\n        return protein\n\n    # Gene sequences\n    intact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Gene Mutations:\\n\")\n\n    # Intact Gene\n    print(f\"Intact Gene:        ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(intact_gene)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is the original, functional protein.\\n\")\n\n    # Mutant 1\n    print(f\"Mutant 1:           ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(mutant_1)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is a missense mutation (Leucine -> Tyrosine).
