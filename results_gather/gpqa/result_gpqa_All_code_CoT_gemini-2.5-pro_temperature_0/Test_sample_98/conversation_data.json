    "My plan is to identify the correct chemical structure by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR) for each of the four options.\n\n1.  **Analyze FTIR Data**: The peaks at 3000 cm⁻¹ (broad O-H) and 1700 cm⁻¹ (strong C=O) strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group type but doesn't distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze 1H NMR Data**: The key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) described.\n    *   A signal is described as a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   I will examine the structure of each candidate molecule to predict the splitting patterns of its methine (CH) protons, as these are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting. I will use the n+1 rule, where a proton's signal is split by its 'n' neighboring protons.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate**:\n    *   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n    *   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n    *   **C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n    *   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The molecule whose predicted splitting patterns match both the observed `dtq` and `dtt` signals will be the correct answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the provided spectroscopic data.\n# The FTIR data (broad peak at 3000 cm-1 for O-H and strong peak at 1700 cm-1 for C=O) confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options fit this description.\n# The 1H NMR data provides the crucial information. We are looking for a molecule that has protons with the following multiplicities:\n# 1. A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\n# 2. A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\n# We will analyze the methine (CH) protons in each candidate molecule, as they are the most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns for each candidate molecule.\n# We use the n+1 rule for splitting. For a proton coupled to multiple different groups of neighbors, the multiplicities are multiplied.\n\n# Let's analyze Candidate C, as it is the most likely suspect.\n# Candidate C: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\n# Let's label the key protons on the main chain for clarity:\n# CH3(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH2(d)-COOH\n\n# Analysis of Proton H(b):\n# - It is adjacent to the 3 protons of the CH3 group (a). This coupling gives a quartet (3+1=4).\n# - It is adjacent to the 1 proton of the CH group (c). This coupling gives a doublet (1+1=2).\n# - It is adjacent to the 2 protons of the CH2 group in its attached ethyl (Et) substituent. This coupling gives a triplet (2+1=3).\n# - The resulting multiplicity for H(b) is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). This matches the first signal described.\n\n# Analysis of Proton H(c):\n# - It is adjacent to the 1 proton of the CH group (b). This coupling gives a doublet (1+1=2).\n# - It is adjacent to the 2 protons of the CH2 group (d). This coupling gives a triplet (2+1=3).\n# - It is adjacent to the 2 protons of the CH2 group in its attached ethyl (Et) substituent. This coupling gives another triplet (2+1=3).\n# - The resulting multiplicity for H(c) is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). This matches the second signal described.\n\n# Step 3: Conclusion\n# Candidate C is the only molecule that has protons matching both the 'doublet of triplets of quartets' and the 'doublet of triplets of triplets' signals observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. The other candidates do not produce this specific combination of signals.\n# - Candidate A produces a 'dtt' but not a 'dtq'.\n# - Candidate B produces a 'dtq' but not a 'dtt'.\n# - Candidate D produces a 'dtq' but not a 'dtt'.\n\nfinal_answer = \"C\"\n\nprint(f\"Based on the analysis, the unknown compound is C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.\")\nprint(f\"This is because its structure is the only one that accounts for both complex 1H NMR signals:\")\nprint(f\"1. A 'doublet of triplets of quartets' (dtq).\")\nprint(f\"2. A 'doublet of triplets of triplets' (dtt).\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct choice is {final_answer}.\")\n<<<C>>>\n```"
