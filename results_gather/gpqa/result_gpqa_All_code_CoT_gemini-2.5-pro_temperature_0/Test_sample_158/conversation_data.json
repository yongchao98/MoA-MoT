    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Physical Process:**\nThe problem describes a quasar spectrum with a peak at 790 nm and a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths. This is a classic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line, which has a rest-frame wavelength of 121.6 nm. The flux drop is caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium between us and the quasar (the Lyman-alpha forest).\n\n**2. Calculate the Redshift (z):**\nThe redshift relates the observed wavelength (λ_obs) to the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest`. We can use this to find the redshift of the quasar.\n\n**3. Use the Comoving Distance Formula:**\nFor the given flat Lambda-CDM cosmological model, the comoving distance (D_c) is calculated by integrating over redshift. The formula is:\n`D_c = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')`\nwhere:\n*   `D_H = c / H₀` is the Hubble distance.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `H₀` is the Hubble constant.\n*   `E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z)³ + Ω_Λ)` is the function describing the evolution of the Hubble parameter.\n\n**4. Execute the Calculation:**\nI will write a Python script to perform these calculations. The script will:\n*   Define the given cosmological parameters and physical constants.\n*   Calculate the redshift `z`.\n*   Use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function to numerically solve the integral for the comoving distance.\n*   Convert the final distance to Gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n*   Compare the result with the given options to find the closest value.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Define the constants and cosmological parameters.\n# Observed wavelength of the Lyman-alpha peak in nm.\nlambda_obs = 790.0\n# Rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in nm.\nlambda_rest = 121.6\n# Hubble constant in km s^-1 Mpc^-1.\nH0 = 70.0\n# Matter density parameter.\nOmega_m = 0.3\n# Dark energy density parameter.\nOmega_lambda = 0.7\n# Speed of light in km/s.\nc = 299792.458\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the redshift (z).\nz = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n# Step 3: Define the function to be integrated for comoving distance.\ndef integrand(z_prime):\n    \"\"\"The integrand 1/E(z) for the comoving distance calculation.\"\"\"\n    E_z = np.sqrt(Omega_m * (1 + z_prime)**3 + Omega_lambda)\n    return 1.0 / E_z\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the comoving distance.\n# Calculate the Hubble distance in Mpc.\nD_H = c / H0\n# Perform the numerical integration from 0 to z.\nintegral_value, _ = quad(integrand, 0, z)\n# Calculate the comoving distance in Mpc.\nDc_Mpc = D_H * integral_value\n# Convert the distance to Gpc.\nDc_Gpc = Dc_Mpc / 1000.0\n\n# Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.\noptions = {'A': 9.0, 'B': 7.0, 'C': 6.0, 'D': 8.0}\n# Find the option with the minimum absolute difference from the calculated value.\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - Dc_Gpc))\n\n# Print the results.\nprint(f\"The calculated redshift of the quasar is: z = {z:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated comoving distance is: {Dc_Gpc:.2f} Gpc\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 9 Gpc (Difference: {abs(Dc_Gpc - options['A']):.2f})\")\nprint(f\"B) 7 Gpc (Difference: {abs(Dc_Gpc - options['B']):.2f})\")\nprint(f\"C) 6 Gpc (Difference: {abs(Dc_Gpc - options['C']):.2f})\")\nprint(f\"D) 8 Gpc (Difference: {abs(Dc_Gpc - options['D']):.2f})\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe closest value is {options[closest_option]} Gpc.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct option is {closest_option}.\")\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
