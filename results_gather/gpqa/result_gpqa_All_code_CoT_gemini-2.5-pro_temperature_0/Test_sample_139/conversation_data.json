    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Chemical Riddle:** I will analyze the clues provided to identify the unknown substances, particularly Substance X.\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting point of B.** The melting point of B is ~277 K, which is approximately 4°C. This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O). So, B is D₂O.\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B.** B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This implies G is a deuterated hydrate or hydroxide, like a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating.\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction.** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. This is a classic pattern for a reactive metal hydride/deuteride reacting with water/heavy water.\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W.** Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. If the reaction involves deuterated compounds, a likely candidate for W is deuterium gas, D₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons).\n    *   **Clue 5: Putting it together.** If X is a deuteride and it reacts with Y=D₂O, the reaction would be: `Metal-Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) -> Metal-Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`. This is consistent with all clues so far.\n    *   **Clue 6: Organic Chemistry Context.** X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its reaction with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates X is a strong reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygens).\n    *   **Clue 7: Identifying X.** A very common strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits all the clues perfectly. It reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and precipitates of LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The problem asks for the cumulative atomic mass of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Mass of all Hydrogen atoms: There are 4 Deuterium (D) atoms. The mass of one D atom is ~2 amu. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all Aluminum atoms: There is 1 Aluminum (Al) atom. The mass of the stable isotope of Al is ~27 amu. Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The final sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the counts and masses of the identified atoms and perform the final summation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Identify Substance X as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4) based on the chemical clues.\n#    - Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of Deuterium, D).\n#    - Heaviest element: Aluminum (present as 1 atom of Al).\n# 2. Define the atomic masses for the isotopes involved.\n#    - Mass of Deuterium (D) is approximately 2.\n#    - Mass of Aluminum (Al) is approximately 27.\n# 3. Calculate the cumulative mass as requested.\n#    - Sum = (number of D atoms * mass of D) + (number of Al atoms * mass of Al)\n\n# Number of atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen, as Deuterium)\nnum_lightest_element_atoms = 4\n# Mass of the isotope of the lightest element (Deuterium)\nmass_lightest_isotope = 2\n\n# Number of atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum)\nnum_heaviest_element_atoms = 1\n# Mass of the isotope of the heaviest element (Aluminum-27)\nmass_heaviest_isotope = 27\n\n# Calculate the total mass for the lightest element's atoms\ntotal_mass_lightest = num_lightest_element_atoms * mass_lightest_isotope\n\n# Calculate the total mass for the heaviest element's atoms\ntotal_mass_heaviest = num_heaviest_element_atoms * mass_heaviest_isotope\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The cumulative atomic mass is: {cumulative_mass}\")\nprint(\"The correct option is A.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
