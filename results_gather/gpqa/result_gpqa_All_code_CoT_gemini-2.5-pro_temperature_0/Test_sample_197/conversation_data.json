    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The mole fraction of a specific complex can be determined using the stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the species:** The cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free Co²⁺ ion and the complexes [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n2.  **Formulate the mole fraction equation:** The fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is given by the concentration of that complex divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species. This can be expressed in terms of the stability constants and the ligand concentration:\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n3.  **Use the given values:** We are given the stability constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄) and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is not needed for this calculation as it cancels out.\n4.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute the given values into the formula to find the fraction α₂, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given concentration of thiocyanate ligand [SCN-]\nscn_conc = 0.1  # M\n\n# The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of all cobalt-containing species:\n# c(Co) = [Co2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4]2-\n# Using stability constants, we can express each term relative to [Co2+]:\n# c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n# The concentration of the target complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II), is:\n# [Co(SCN)2] = beta2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2\n\n# The percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is ([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) * 100.\n# The [Co2+] term cancels out, so we can calculate the fraction directly.\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the fraction (often denoted as Φ)\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc**1 + beta2 * scn_conc**2 + beta3 * scn_conc**3 + beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# Calculate the numerator term for the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator_CoSCN2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2) of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nalpha_2 = numerator_CoSCN2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 42.3%\")\nprint(\"B) 38.1%\")\nprint(\"C) 25.6%\")\nprint(\"D) 16.9%\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option D.\")\n\n<<<D>>>\n```"
