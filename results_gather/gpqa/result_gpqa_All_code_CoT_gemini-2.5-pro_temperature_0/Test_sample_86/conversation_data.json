    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deciphering the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached. A benzene ring itself has 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This is one of the two substituents.\n\nLet's combine these facts:\n*   Substituent 1: A halogen atom (-X). This has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   Substituent 2: Must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nSo, the compound is a halo-acetophenone.\n\n**2. Determining the Substitution Pattern from NMR Data:**\n\nThe problem states the ring is di-substituted, which means the two groups can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. Let's look at the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) of the NMR options:\n\n*   **A)** 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) -> Two signals, each representing 2 protons. This symmetry (two sets of two equivalent protons) is characteristic of a **para (1,4) substitution**.\n*   **B)** No signals in the aromatic region. Incorrect.\n*   **C)** One signal for 1 proton. Incorrect for a di-substituted ring.\n*   **D)** 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) -> Also indicates a **para (1,4) substitution**.\n\nSo, the compound is a **para-haloacetophenone** (or 4-haloacetophenone).\n\n**3. Predicting the Full 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nNow let's predict the full spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone and compare it with options A and D.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons**: We've established this will be two doublets, each for 2 protons, in the 7-8 ppm range. Both A and D match this.\n*   **Substituent Protons**: The only other protons are in the acetyl group's methyl (-CH₃).\n    *   These 3 protons are on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group, but not adjacent to any other proton-bearing carbon.\n    *   Therefore, they should appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**.\n    *   The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (R-CO-CH₃) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Final Options:**\n\n*   **Option A**: `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`\n    *   Aromatic part: Matches the para-substitution pattern.\n    *   Aliphatic part: `2.3 (3H, s)` perfectly matches the predicted signal for the acetyl methyl group in terms of chemical shift, integration (3H), and splitting (singlet). This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option D**: `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`\n    *   This option has a signal at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. It also lacks the 3H singlet for the methyl group. This does not match our deduced structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a 4-haloacetophenone, and its 1H NMR spectrum is correctly described by option A.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided chemical information to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n    1.  **Analyze the compound description:**\n        - Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring: A benzene ring with two groups.\n        - 8 total carbon atoms: 6 in the ring, 2 in the substituents.\n        - FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X).\n\n    2.  **Deduce the structure:**\n        - One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n        - The other must have 2 carbons and a C=O group. This is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n        - The compound is a halo-acetophenone.\n\n    3.  **Analyze the NMR options for substitution pattern:**\n        - The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each for 2H, is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution. This points to options A and D.\n\n    4.  **Predict the full spectrum and compare:**\n        - The structure is 4-haloacetophenone.\n        - It should have:\n            - Two aromatic doublets for 2H each (para pattern).\n            - One singlet for the 3H of the methyl group (-CH3), typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n    5.  **Evaluate the final candidates:**\n        - **Option A:** 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). This perfectly matches the prediction for 4-haloacetophenone.\n        - **Option D:** Contains a signal at 9.9 ppm (aldehyde) and lacks the 3H methyl singlet. This is incorrect.\n\n    Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    correct_option = 'A'\n    print(f\"The reasoning leads to the conclusion that the compound is a 4-haloacetophenone.\")\n    print(f\"The predicted 1H NMR spectrum for this structure consists of:\")\n    print(f\"- Two doublets in the aromatic region (around 7.5-8.0 ppm), each integrating to 2H.\")\n    print(f\"- One singlet (from the -COCH3 group) in the aliphatic region (around 2.3 ppm), integrating to 3H.\")\n    print(f\"This prediction perfectly matches the data provided in option A.\")\n    print(f\"The correct choice is: {correct_option}\")\n\nsolve_nmr_puzzle()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
