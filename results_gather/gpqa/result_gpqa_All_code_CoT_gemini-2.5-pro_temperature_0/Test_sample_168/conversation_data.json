    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Original Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V):**\n    *   The problem states that the total energy spectrum of the two E particles is *continuous*.\n    *   Why is it continuous? In any decay, the total energy released is fixed, determined by the mass difference between the initial and final states. This energy is then distributed among the final products.\n    *   In this case, the final state has multiple particles (2B, 2E, 2V). Let's focus on the light particles that share most of the kinetic energy: 2E and 2V.\n    *   Because the total available kinetic energy is shared between the E particles and the V particles, the energy of the E particles is not a single, fixed value. It can range from nearly zero (if the V particles take almost all the energy) to a maximum value (if the V particles take the minimum possible energy). This range of possible energies is what makes the spectrum continuous.\n    *   The endpoint, Q, represents this maximum possible total energy for the two E particles.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Variant Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M):**\n    *   The initial (2A) and final heavy particles (2B) are the same, so the total energy released by the heavy particle transition is identical to the original decay.\n    *   The final light particles are now 2E and one exotic particle M.\n    *   The total released energy is now shared among the 2E particles and the single M particle.\n    *   Since the energy is still being shared among multiple final-state particles (2E and M), the energy of the E particles is still not fixed. It can vary depending on how much energy the M particle carries away.\n    *   Therefore, the energy spectrum of the E particles will **remain continuous**. This immediately eliminates options A and D, which state the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n3.  **Compare the Endpoints (Q vs. the new endpoint Q'):**\n    *   The endpoint is the maximum energy the E particles can have. This occurs when the *other* light particles in the decay carry away the *minimum* possible energy.\n    *   **Original Decay:** The other light particles are two V particles. Like neutrinos, these particles have mass (`m_V > 0`). The minimum energy they must carry away is their rest mass energy, which is `2 * m_V * c^2`. So, some of the total released energy is \"spent\" just to create the mass of the two V particles. The endpoint Q is the total energy released minus the energy needed to create the V particles' mass (and any minimal kinetic energy).\n    *   **Variant Decay:** The other light particle is M, which is explicitly stated to be *massless* (`m_M = 0`). The minimum energy a massless particle can have is zero (zero kinetic energy). No energy needs to be \"spent\" to create its rest mass.\n    *   **Comparison:** In the variant decay, the energy that was previously required to create the mass of the two V particles is now available as kinetic energy for the final products. This means there is more total kinetic energy to be shared. Consequently, the maximum possible energy that the E particles can have is higher than before.\n    *   Therefore, the endpoint **increases**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The spectrum remains continuous.\n    *   The endpoint increases.\n    *   This corresponds to option **B**.\n\nI will now generate the Python code to print this explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_decay_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a nuclear decay problem and determines the change in the energy spectrum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the nature of the energy spectrum.\n    # In the original decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V), the final state has multiple light particles (2E, 2V)\n    # sharing the available energy. This sharing results in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles.\n    # In the variant decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M), the energy is still shared between multiple light\n    # particles (2E, M). Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous. This eliminates options A and D.\n    \n    # Step 2: Compare the energy endpoints.\n    # The endpoint of the E particle spectrum corresponds to the maximum energy the E particles can have.\n    # This occurs when the other emitted particles carry away the minimum possible energy.\n    # The total energy released (let's call it E_release) is the same in both cases because the\n    # initial (2A) and final heavy (2B) particles are the same.\n\n    # Case 1 (Original): 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V\n    # The other emitted particles are two V particles. These particles have mass (m_V > 0).\n    # The minimum energy they must carry away is their combined rest mass energy, 2 * m_V * c^2.\n    # So, a portion of E_release is consumed just to create the mass of the V particles.\n    # The endpoint Q is proportional to E_release - (2 * m_V * c^2).\n\n    # Case 2 (Variant): 2A -> 2B + 2E + M\n    # The other emitted particle is M, which is massless (m_M = 0).\n    # The minimum energy a massless particle can carry is zero.\n    # The new endpoint Q' is proportional to E_release - 0.\n\n    # Step 3: Conclusion.\n    # Since m_V > 0, the term (2 * m_V * c^2) is positive.\n    # This means Q' > Q. The endpoint of the spectrum increases because the energy that was\n    # previously needed to create the mass of the two V particles is now available as kinetic energy.\n    # The correct option is that the spectrum remains continuous and the endpoint increases.\n\n    final_choice = \"B\"\n    explanation = \"The spectrum remains continuous because the final state still involves multiple particles (2E and M) sharing the decay energy. The endpoint increases because the variant decay emits a single massless particle (M) instead of two massive particles (2V). The energy that would have been converted into the rest mass of the two V particles is now available as kinetic energy, raising the maximum possible energy for the E particles.\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis of the decay process:\")\n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_choice}>>>\")\n\nsolve_decay_problem()\n```"
