    "To determine the pH of the mixed solution, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:** We need to find the number of moles of the weak acid (CH3COOH), the strong acid (H+ from HCl), and the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2).\n2.  **Account for neutralization:** The strong acid and strong base will react first. Then, any excess strong acid or base will react with the weak species (CH3COOH).\n3.  **Determine the final composition:** We will identify the major species remaining in the solution after all reactions are complete. The pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong acid or strong base.\n4.  **Calculate the final pH:** Based on the concentration of the excess H+ or OH-, we will calculate the final pH of the solution.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs these calculations:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.\n# Moles = Concentration (M) * Volume (L)\n\n# Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid)\nvol_ch3cooh = 500 / 1000  # 0.500 L\nconc_ch3cooh = 0.1       # M\nmoles_ch3cooh = vol_ch3cooh * conc_ch3cooh\n\n# Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid)\nvol_hcl = 400 / 1000  # 0.400 L\nconc_hcl = 0.2       # M\nmoles_hcl = vol_hcl * conc_hcl\n# HCl is a strong acid, so moles H+ = moles HCl\nmoles_h_strong = moles_hcl\n\n# Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base)\nvol_baoh2 = 300 / 1000  # 0.300 L\nconc_baoh2 = 0.3       # M\nmoles_baoh2 = vol_baoh2 * conc_baoh2\n# Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH- per mole of Ba(OH)2\nmoles_oh_strong = 2 * moles_baoh2\n\n# Step 2: Perform neutralization reactions.\n# First, the strong acid (H+) reacts with the strong base (OH-).\n# H+ + OH- -> H2O\nmoles_oh_after_hcl = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong\n\n# Next, the remaining strong base (OH-) reacts with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n# CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_hcl - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 3: Determine the final composition and calculate concentration.\n# The solution has an excess of strong base (OH-).\n# Calculate the total volume of the solution.\ntotal_volume = vol_ch3cooh + vol_hcl + vol_baoh2\n\n# Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-.\nconc_oh_excess = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final pH.\n# Calculate pOH from the concentration of OH-.\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh_excess)\n\n# Calculate pH from pOH (pH + pOH = 14).\npH = 14 - pOH\n\n# Print the final result and the options.\nprint(f\"The calculated pH of the solution is: {pH:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(\"A) 12.62\")\nprint(\"B) 8.68\")\nprint(\"C) 1.38\")\nprint(\"D) 8.92\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
