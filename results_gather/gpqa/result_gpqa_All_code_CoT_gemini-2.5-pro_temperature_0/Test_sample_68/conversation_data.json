    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Physics Problem:** The question asks for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of particle decays. The most characteristic length scale for a decaying particle is its mean decay length in the laboratory frame ($L$). Let's calculate this length and then check if it satisfies the condition. The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than the mean decay length $L$ before decaying is given by the exponential decay law, $P(x > L) = e^{-L/L} = e^{-1} \\approx 0.368$, or 36.8%. Since 36.8% is \"at least 30%\", the mean decay length is a reasonable value for the required resolution.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   Proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$): $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Rest mass energy ($mc^2$): $3.41$ GeV\n    *   Energy in the Bubble Chamber: $27$ GeV. This is often ambiguous. It could be total energy or kinetic energy. Let's assume it's the kinetic energy (KE), as this is common in such problems, and we will see it leads to an answer that matches one of the options.\n    *   Speed of light (c): $\\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Energy ($E_{total}$):** The total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the rest mass energy.\n    $E_{total} = KE + mc^2$\n\n4.  **Calculate Relativistic Momentum ($p$):** We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    $E_{total}^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n    We can solve for the momentum term, $pc$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$):** The mean decay length in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels, on average, before decaying. It is given by $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is its lifetime in the lab frame. A more direct formula using the quantities we have is:\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:** Substitute the known values into the formula to find the length $L$ in meters and compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given constants\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nm_c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\nE_kin = 27.0  # Kinetic energy in GeV\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total energy\n# We assume the 27 GeV is kinetic energy, as this leads to one of the options.\nE_total = E_kin + m_c2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the relativistic momentum term (pc)\n# From the relation E_total^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\npc = math.sqrt(E_total**2 - m_c2**2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the mean decay length (L) in the lab frame\n# L = (pc / mc^2) * c * tau_0\nmean_decay_length = (pc / m_c2) * c * tau_0\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and the options\nprint(f\"The calculated mean decay length is: {mean_decay_length:.2e} m\")\nprint(\"The given options are:\")\nprint(f\"A) 2.08e-3 m\")\nprint(f\"B) 2.08e-6 m\")\nprint(f\"C) 2.08e-9 m\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.08e-1 m\")\n\n# The calculated value of 2.13e-6 m is closest to option B.\n# The small discrepancy is likely due to the precise values of constants used when creating the problem.\n```\n<<<B>>>"
