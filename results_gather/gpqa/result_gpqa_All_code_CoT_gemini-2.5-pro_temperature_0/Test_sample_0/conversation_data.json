    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt or τ) to the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is given by ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ, where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant. This means a state with a shorter lifetime has a larger \"spread\" or uncertainty in its energy.\n\n2.  **Establish the Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (or \"widths\"). So, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.\n\n3.  **Calculate Energy Uncertainties:**\n    *   I will use the value of the reduced Planck constant in electron-volt-seconds (eV·s), which is approximately ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. This avoids an extra conversion step from Joules.\n    *   I will calculate the energy uncertainty for the first state (ΔE1) using its lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   I will calculate the energy uncertainty for the second state (ΔE2) using its lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n\n4.  **Determine Minimum Energy Difference:**\n    *   I will sum the two energy uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to find the minimum energy difference required to resolve the two levels.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   I will compare this calculated minimum energy difference with the four given options (A, B, C, D).\n    *   The correct option will be the one that is significantly larger than the calculated minimum required separation.\n\n6.  **Final Output:** The code will print the step-by-step calculations and then identify the correct choice from the list.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16  \n# Lifetime of the first state in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9  \n# Lifetime of the second state in seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  \n\n# The options for the energy difference in eV\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-8,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"This problem uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\")\nprint(\"The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the lifetime of a state (τ) are related by ΔE * τ ≈ ħ.\")\nprint(\"To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (widths).\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state\n# ΔE = ħ / τ\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 1 (τ1): {tau1:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 2 (τ2): {tau2:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the minimum required energy difference for resolution\n# The condition is |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\nmin_energy_diff = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(\"The minimum energy difference required to resolve the two states is the sum of their uncertainties:\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required difference = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = {min_energy_diff:.3e} eV\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Compare the minimum required difference with the given options\nprint(\"Now, we check which option is greater than this minimum required difference:\")\ncorrect_option = None\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    is_resolvable = value > min_energy_diff\n    print(f\"Option {option}) {value:.1e} eV: Is it > {min_energy_diff:.3e} eV? -> {is_resolvable}\")\n    if is_resolvable:\n        correct_option = option\n\nprint(f\"\\nBased on the calculations, the only energy difference large enough to resolve the two states is option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer Choice: {correct_option}\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
