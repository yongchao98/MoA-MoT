    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the Equilibrium:** The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. The reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.\n2.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant (K_f) for Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- <=> [Ca-EDTA]^2-, which is K_f = 5x10^10. The reaction we are interested in is the dissociation, so we need the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant: K_d = 1 / K_f.\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions that form at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of EDTA^4- will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]^2- complex will be its initial concentration (0.02 M) minus 'x'.\n    *   [Ca-EDTA]^2- = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca^2+] = x\n    *   [EDTA^4-] = x\n4.  **Write the K_d Expression:** The expression for the dissociation constant is K_d = ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]. Substituting the terms from the ICE table, we get K_d = (x * x) / (0.02 - x).\n5.  **Simplify and Solve:** Since the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation constant K_d will be very small. This implies that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. The equation simplifies to K_d ≈ x^2 / 0.02.\n6.  **Calculate 'x':** Rearrange the simplified equation to solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of calcium ions.\n7.  **Compare with Options:** Match the calculated value of 'x' with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values\ninitial_conc_complex = 0.02  # M\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant for Ca-EDTA\n\n# The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n# The equilibrium reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n# The equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f).\nK_d = 1 / K_f\n\n# Let x be the equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions.\n# From the stoichiometry, [EDTA^4-] will also be x.\n# The equilibrium concentration of the complex will be (initial_conc_complex - x).\n# The expression for K_d is: K_d = ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]\n# K_d = (x * x) / (initial_conc_complex - x)\n\n# Since K_f is very large, K_d is very small, meaning x will be very small compared to 0.02.\n# We can simplify the equation by approximating (initial_conc_complex - x) ≈ initial_conc_complex.\n# So, K_d ≈ x^2 / initial_conc_complex\n\n# Now, we solve for x:\n# x^2 ≈ K_d * initial_conc_complex\nx_squared = K_d * initial_conc_complex\n\n# x is the square root of x_squared\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The concentration of calcium ions is x.\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of calcium ions [Ca^2+] is: {x:.2e} M\")\n\n# The provided options are:\n# A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n# B) 2.0x10^-2 M\n# C) 6.3x10^-7 M\n# D) 5.0x10^-3 M\n# The calculated value 6.32e-07 M matches option C.\nprint(\"The correct option is C.\")\n<<<C>>>"
