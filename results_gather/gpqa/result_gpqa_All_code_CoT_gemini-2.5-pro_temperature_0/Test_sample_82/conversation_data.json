    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: First, we calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after it's diluted with water. The number of moles of acetic acid remains the same, but the total volume increases.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = Initial Volume × Initial Concentration.\n    *   New concentration = Initial moles / New Total Volume.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration**: This point is in the buffer region of the titration curve, where both the weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO⁻) are present. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   pKa is calculated as -log10(Ka).\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid. So, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n    *   First, calculate the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (moles of acid = moles of base).\n    *   Then, calculate the total volume of the solution and the concentration of the acetate ion.\n    *   Calculate Kb for the acetate ion using the relationship Ka × Kb = Kw (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   Set up an equilibrium calculation for the hydrolysis reaction (CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻) to find the concentration of OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate pOH from the [OH⁻] concentration.\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n4.  **Final Comparison**: Compare the calculated pH values with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Constants ---\nvol_acid_initial_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nvol_water_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_naoh = 0.1  # M\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid ---\n# Convert volumes from cm3 to L\nvol_acid_initial_L = vol_acid_initial_cm3 / 1000\nvol_water_L = vol_water_cm3 / 1000\n\n# Calculate initial moles of acetic acid\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_initial * vol_acid_initial_L\n\n# Calculate the new volume and concentration after dilution\nvol_acid_diluted_L = vol_acid_initial_L + vol_water_L\nconc_acid_diluted = moles_acid / vol_acid_diluted_L\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region) ---\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25 / 0.75\nratio_A_HA = 0.25 / 0.75\n\n# Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_A_HA)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n# Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point\n# Moles of NaOH needed = moles of acid\nvol_naoh_eq_L = moles_acid / conc_naoh\n\n# Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq_L = vol_acid_diluted_L + vol_naoh_eq_L\n\n# Calculate the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at the equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acid\n\n# Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] from hydrolysis\n# Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-] => Kb = x^2 / (conc_acetate - x)\n# We can approximate that conc_acetate - x ≈ conc_acetate\n# So, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\n\n# Calculate pH from pOH\npH_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\n# --- Step 4: Print the results ---\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 4.57; 6.92\")\nprint(\"B) 4.73; 7.00\")\nprint(\"C) 3.17; 6.73\")\nprint(\"D) 4.26; 8.52\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
