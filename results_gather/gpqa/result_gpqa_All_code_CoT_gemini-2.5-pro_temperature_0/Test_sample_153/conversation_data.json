    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotope, ³⁵Cl) is 156 g/mol.\n*   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32 or 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The 's' (singlet) indicates it has no adjacent protons, and '1H' confirms it's a single proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\n*   **Summary:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156, contains one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group. It perfectly matches all the data: MW of 156 (for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂), contains one Cl, has a carboxylic acid group, and would produce the para-substitution pattern (two doublets) in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid. Also, its aromatic protons are all unique, which would lead to a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the ortho-substitution would make all four aromatic protons chemically distinct, leading to a complex spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only structure that fits all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectral data:\")\n    \n    # Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n    print(\"\\n1.
