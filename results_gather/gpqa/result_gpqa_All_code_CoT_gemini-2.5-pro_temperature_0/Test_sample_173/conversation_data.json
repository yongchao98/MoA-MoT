    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Initial Values:** Set up the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `E_M`, in GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Masses:** Use the given relationships (`m1 = 2*m2` and `m1 + m2 = 0.99*M`) to determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n3.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):** The total kinetic energy released, `Q`, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical):** In the non-relativistic approximation, the total kinetic energy `Q` is shared between the fragments inversely proportional to their masses. We will calculate the kinetic energy `T1` for the more massive fragment (`m1`).\n5.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic):** Using the principles of energy and momentum conservation in special relativity, we will derive and calculate the correct kinetic energy `T1` for the more massive fragment. The total energy of the first fragment (`E1`) can be found using the formula: `E1 = ( (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ) / (2 * M*c^2)`. The kinetic energy is then `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2`.\n6.  **Find the Difference:** Calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values of `T1`.\n7.  **Convert to MeV and Conclude:** Convert the result from GeV to MeV and select the corresponding option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define Initial Values\n# Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus in GeV\nE_M_GeV = 300.0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n# We have two equations:\n# 1) m1c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 2) m1c2 = 2 * m2c2\n# Substitute (2) into (1):\n# 2 * m2c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 3 * m2c2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\nm2c2_GeV = (0.99 * E_M_GeV) / 3.0\nm1c2_GeV = 2.0 * m2c2_GeV\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n# Q is the energy released, which becomes the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\nQ_GeV = E_M_GeV - (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n# In classical mechanics, momentum p is conserved (p1=p2=p), and T = p^2/(2m).\n# So, T1/T2 = m2/m1.\n# Also, T1 + T2 = Q.\n# This leads to T1 = Q * m2 / (m1 + m2).\n# In terms of rest-mass energies: T1 = Q * m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2)\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV * m2c2_GeV / (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic)\n# From relativistic energy-momentum conservation for a two-body decay from rest:\n# The total energy of the first fragment is E1 = (E_M^2 + (m1c2)^2 - (m2c2)^2) / (2 * E_M)\nE1_GeV = (E_M_GeV**2 + m1c2_GeV**2 - m2c2_GeV**2) / (2 * E_M_GeV)\n# The kinetic energy is T1 = E1 - m1c2\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1_GeV - m1c2_GeV\n\n# Step 6: Find the Difference\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\n\n# Step 7: Convert to MeV and Print the Result\n# 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Initial rest-mass energy (M*c^2): {E_M_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2): {m1c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2): {m2c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Total kinetic energy released (Q): {Q_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is {difference_MeV:.2f} MeV.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```"
