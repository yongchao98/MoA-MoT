    "To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most commonly associated with the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality like axial chirality, while lacking elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The single bond connecting the two phenyl rings can have restricted rotation if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'). In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. This steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely, locking them in a non-planar conformation. This phenomenon, known as atropisomerism, results in axial chirality, making the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable. Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydroxyl group (-OH), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). Since C2 is bonded to four distinct substituents, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl rings. It is sp2 hybridized and trigonal planar. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_optical_isomerism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds for optical isomerism and determines the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary to hold the analysis for each compound\n    analysis = {\n        \"1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\": \"Shows optical isomerism.
