    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle.** The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is related to its orbital period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes of its components (K1 + K2). The key relationship, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`. The fact that the systems are eclipsing tells us the inclination angle is close to 90 degrees, which simplifies the relationship and allows for a direct comparison.\n\n2.  **Set up the ratio.** We need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio `M_total_1 / M_total_2`. Using the proportionality from step 1, the ratio can be written as:\n    `Ratio = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³)`\n    Since this is a ratio, the constant of proportionality and the units will cancel out, so we can use the given values directly.\n\n3.  **Assign variables.** I will assign the given values for periods and radial velocities to variables in the Python code.\n    *   `P1 = 2` years\n    *   `K1a = 10` km/s, `K1b = 5` km/s\n    *   `P2 = 1` year\n    *   `K2a = 15` km/s, `K2b = 10` km/s\n\n4.  **Calculate and print the result.** I will implement the formula in Python, calculate the final numerical value, and print it. This result will then be compared to the given options to select the correct one.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # Period in years\nK1a = 10.0  # Radial velocity amplitude of star 1a in km/s\nK1b = 5.0   # Radial velocity amplitude of star 1b in km/s\n\n# Define the parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # Period in years\nK2a = 15.0  # Radial velocity amplitude of star 2a in km/s\nK2b = 10.0  # Radial velocity amplitude of star 2b in km/s\n\n# The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binary is proportional to P * (K_total)^3.\n# We can calculate the ratio of the masses without needing the proportionality constant.\n\n# Calculate the total radial velocity amplitude for each system\nK1_total = K1a + K1b\nK2_total = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the proportional mass for each system\n# Mass_1 is proportional to P1 * (K1_total)^3\n# Mass_2 is proportional to P2 * (K2_total)^3\nproportional_mass_1 = P1 * (K1_total)**3\nproportional_mass_2 = P2 * (K2_total)**3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2\nmass_ratio = proportional_mass_1 / proportional_mass_2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The sum of radial velocity amplitudes for system_1 is: {K1_total} km/s\")\nprint(f\"The sum of radial velocity amplitudes for system_2 is: {K2_total} km/s\")\nprint(f\"The mass of system_1 is proportional to: {proportional_mass_1}\")\nprint(f\"The mass of system_2 is proportional to: {proportional_mass_2}\")\nprint(f\"The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is: {mass_ratio:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ 0.4\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ 0.7\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ 0.6\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ 1.2\")\nprint(\"The calculated value is closest to option A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
