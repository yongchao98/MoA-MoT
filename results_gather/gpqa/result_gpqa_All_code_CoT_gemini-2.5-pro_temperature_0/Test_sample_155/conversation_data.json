    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   The overall process is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a meso compound. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single meso diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (Z)-oct-4-ene with the same reagents.\n    *   This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers. Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Mixture:** The chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n    *   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\n4.  **Predict the Standard HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   Standard (achiral) HPLC separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) pair) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like the meso compound and either of the enantiomers) have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Therefore, we expect two peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n5.  **Predict the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer to the other two and will also have a unique retention time, appearing as a third peak.\n    *   Therefore, we expect three distinct peaks for the three stereoisomers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the products of two stereospecific reactions and predicts the\n    number of peaks observed in standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n    # (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n    # A trans-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a meso compound.\n    reaction1_product = \"Meso-octane-4,5-diol ((4R,5S)-diol)\"\n    print(\"--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+\")\n    print(f\"Product 1: A single meso compound ({reaction1_product}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n    # (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n    # A cis-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    reaction2_products = [\"(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\", \"(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\"]\n    print(\"Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+\")\n    print(f\"Product 2: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: {reaction2_products[0]} and {reaction2_products[1]}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 3: Combine the products\n    # The final mixture contains three unique stereoisomers.\n    final_mixture = [reaction1_product] + reaction2_products\n    print(\"Combined Product Mixture contains 3 stereoisomers:\")\n    for i, compound in enumerate(final_mixture):\n        print(f\"  {i+1}. {compound}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 4: Predict Standard (Achiral) HPLC results\n    # Achiral HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n    # The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair.\n    # The two enantiomers will elute together.\n    standard_hplc_peaks = 2\n    print(\"Standard (Achiral) HPLC Analysis:\")\n    print(\" - Peak 1: The meso compound.\")\n    print(\" - Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) + (4S,5S)).\")\n    print(f\"Total peaks in standard HPLC: {standard_hplc_peaks}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 5: Predict Chiral HPLC results\n    # Chiral HPLC separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    chiral_hplc_peaks = 3\n    print(\"Chiral HPLC Analysis:\")\n    print(\" - Peak 1: The meso compound.\")\n    print(\" - Peak 2: One enantiomer, e.g., (4R,5R)-diol.\")\n    print(\" - Peak 3: The other enantiomer, e.g., (4S,5S)-diol.\")\n    print(f\"Total peaks in chiral HPLC: {chiral_hplc_peaks}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 6: Determine the correct option\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\",\n        \"B\": \"4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\",\n        \"C\": \"2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\",\n        \"D\": \"2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\"\n    }\n\n    final_answer = None\n    for choice, description in options.items():\n        if f\"{standard_hplc_peaks} peaks in standard HPLC and {chiral_hplc_peaks} peaks in chiral HPLC\" == description:\n            final_answer = choice\n            break\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The analysis shows {standard_hplc_peaks} peaks in standard HPLC and {chiral_hplc_peaks} peaks in chiral HPLC.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to option {final_answer}.\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_hplc_problem()\n```"
