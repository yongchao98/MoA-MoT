    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** I will break down the key elements of the biological experiment described:\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus capsid proteins delivered orally.\n    *   **Location:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut crucial for mucosal immunity.\n    *   **Cells:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. This indicates clonal expansion of lymphocytes (likely B cells) that have recognized the antigen.\n    *   **Key Observation:** \"High variability\" is found in the \"variable heavy chain gene.\" This gene determines the antigen-binding specificity of antibodies.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options:** I will assess each choice in the context of the scenario:\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process alters the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA), which changes the antibody's function but does *not* affect the variability of the antigen-binding (variable) region.\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system involving a cascade of proteins. It does not involve genetic modification of lymphocyte variable genes.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within germinal centers (found in Peyer's patches). It deliberately introduces a high rate of point mutations into the variable region genes. The goal is to generate B cells with higher affinity for the antigen. This perfectly matches the observation of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a proliferating cell population in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. It is not the cause of the increased variability seen during an active immune response.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines the problem and options, contains the reasoning as a string, and then prints the analysis and the final correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_immunology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a biological scenario and determines the correct immunological process.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?\"\n\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"class switching recombination\",\n        \"B\": \"complement activation\",\n        \"C\": \"somatic hypermutation\",\n        \"D\": \"VDJ recombination\"\n    }\n\n    reasoning = \"\"\"\n    1.  The experiment describes an active immune response to an antigen (rotavirus protein) within Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs.\n    2.  The isolation of a 'proliferating cell population' points to the clonal expansion of B cells in a germinal center reaction.\n    3.  The key finding is 'high variability' specifically in the 'variable heavy chain gene'. This gene region is responsible for binding to the antigen.\n    4.  Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) is the biological mechanism that introduces point mutations at a high rate into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in activated B cells. This process is essential for affinity maturation, where B cells producing higher-affinity antibodies are selected.\n    5.  Other options are incorrect: Class switching affects the constant region, not the variable region's variability. V(D)J recombination creates initial diversity in the bone marrow before antigen encounter. Complement activation is a separate protein-based system.\n    6.  Therefore, the observed high variability is a direct result of somatic hypermutation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    correct_choice = \"C\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the question...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Question:\", question)\n    print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}) {value}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nReasoning:\")\n    print(reasoning)\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The process taking place is '{options[correct_choice]}'.\")\n    print(f\"The correct choice is: {correct_choice}\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer\nsolve_immunology_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
