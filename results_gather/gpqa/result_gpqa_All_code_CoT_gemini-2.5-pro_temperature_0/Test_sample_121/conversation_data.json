    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Trace the reaction sequence:** Determine the chemical structure of each intermediate product (1, 2, 3) and the final product (4).\n2.  **Analyze the final structure:** Examine the structure of product 4 for any elements of symmetry.\n3.  **Count distinct hydrogens:** Based on the symmetry, identify all groups of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens. The number of these groups corresponds to the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n4.  **Provide the code:** Write a Python script that prints the final count and the corresponding multiple-choice option.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) undergoes alpha-bromination. This reaction replaces one of the alpha-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (a carboxylic acid) reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (H2SO4). This is a Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an SN2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reaction 4:** This is a tandem deprotonation-alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, which is the most acidic position.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine atoms on 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    3.  The excess NaH removes the second proton from the same carbon.\n    4.  The new carbanion performs an intramolecular attack on the other end of the pentane chain, closing a ring. This forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n**Analysis of Final Product (4) for 1H NMR:**\n\nThe final product is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. To count the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we look for symmetry.\n\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4, the cyano group, and the ester group (considering time-averaging from free rotation).\n*   Due to this symmetry and the rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring at room temperature, we can identify the following distinct sets of hydrogens:\n    1.  **-CH3 protons:** The three hydrogens on the methyl part of the ethyl ester are equivalent. (1 signal)\n    2.  **-OCH2- protons:** The two hydrogens on the methylene part of the ethyl ester are equivalent. (1 signal)\n    3.  **C2/C6 protons:** The four hydrogens on carbons 2 and 6 of the ring are equivalent to each other. (1 signal)\n    4.  **C3/C5 protons:** The four hydrogens on carbons 3 and 5 of the ring are equivalent to each other. (1 signal)\n    5.  **C4 protons:** The two hydrogens on carbon 4 of the ring are equivalent to each other. (1 signal)\n\nCounting these distinct groups gives a total of 5 signals.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of distinct hydrogen signals for the final product.\n\n# The final product of the reaction sequence is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n# We need to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in this molecule.\n\n# 1. Protons on the ethyl group (-COOCH2CH3):\n#    - The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent. (Signal 1)\n#    - The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are equivalent. (Signal 2)\n#\n# 2. Protons on the cyclohexane ring:\n#    - The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4.\n#    - Due to symmetry and rapid chair-flipping, the 4 protons on C2 and C6 are equivalent. (Signal 3)\n#    - The 4 protons on C3 and C5 are equivalent. (Signal 4)\n#    - The 2 protons on C4 are equivalent. (Signal 5)\n\n# Total number of signals is the sum of these distinct environments.\nnum_signals = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\nchoice = 'B'\n\nprint(f\"The number of distinct hydrogen signals is: {num_signals}\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to choice: {choice}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
