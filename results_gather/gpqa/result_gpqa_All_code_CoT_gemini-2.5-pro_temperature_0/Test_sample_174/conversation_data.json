    "An oscillating spheroid-shaped charge distribution acts as an oscillating electric dipole. The radiated power per unit solid angle from such a dipole is not uniform in all directions. We can determine the answer by analyzing the angular and wavelength dependence of the radiation.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this case). The maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°`.\n    We need to find the fraction of this maximum power at `θ = 30°`. This fraction will be `sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)`.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence:** The same formula for radiated power shows its dependence on the oscillation frequency:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n    where `ω` is the angular frequency. The relationship between angular frequency (`ω`), speed of light (`c`), and wavelength (`λ`) is `ω = 2πc / λ`.\n    Therefore, the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`, which is `λ⁻⁴`. This gives us the functional form of `f` with respect to `λ`.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:** We will write a Python script to calculate the fraction from Step 1 and then combine it with the result from Step 2 to select the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the angular dependence part\n# The angle is given in degrees\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# Convert degrees to radians for the sin function\ntheta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)\n\n# The radiated power is proportional to sin^2(theta)\n# The maximum power A is proportional to sin^2(90 degrees), which is 1.\n# So, the fraction of A at theta = 30 degrees is sin^2(30 degrees).\nfraction = math.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\nprint(f\"The angle is {theta_deg} degrees.\")\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power radiated at this angle is sin^2({theta_deg}) = {fraction:.2f}.\")\n\n# Step 2: Determine the wavelength dependence\n# The radiated power per unit solid angle (dP/dOmega) for an oscillating electric dipole\n# is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (omega^4).\n# Since omega is proportional to 1/lambda, dP/dOmega is proportional to (1/lambda)^4 or lambda^(-4).\nwavelength_dependence = \"lambda^(-4)\"\nprint(f\"The radiated power has a wavelength dependence of the form: {wavelength_dependence}.\")\n\n# Step 3: Match the results with the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": (3/4, \"lambda^(-6)\"),\n    \"B\": (1/4, \"lambda^(-4)\"),\n    \"C\": (1/2, \"lambda^(-4)\"),\n    \"D\": (1/4, \"lambda^(-3)\")\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing our results with the options:\")\nfor choice, values in options.items():\n    if math.isclose(values[0], fraction) and values[1] == wavelength_dependence:\n        correct_choice = choice\n        break\n\nprint(f\"The calculated fraction is {fraction:.2f} and the wavelength dependence is {wavelength_dependence}.\")\nprint(f\"This matches option {correct_choice}.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct option is {correct_choice}.\")\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(f'<<<B>>>')\n```"
