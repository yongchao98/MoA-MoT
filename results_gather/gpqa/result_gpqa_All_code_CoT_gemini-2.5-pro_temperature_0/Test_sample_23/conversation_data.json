    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of Z**: We'll use the given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) to find the empirical and molecular formula of the hydrocarbon Z. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be an alkane or a cycloalkane. The mass fraction strongly suggests a CnH2n formula, characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Z and Mixture Y**: Based on the chemical properties described (common solvent, product of hydrogenation, part of a disproportionation reaction), we can deduce the specific structure of Z. The properties of mixture Y (does not decolorize bromine water, hydrogenates to Z) allow us to identify its two components, one of which is Z. The most plausible scenario involves a C6 carbon skeleton, making Z cyclohexane and the other component of Y benzene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**: The reaction where mixture X forms mixture Y is a disproportionation, specifically a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is dehydrogenated to form benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**: By setting up a hydrogen balance for the disproportionation reaction, we can create an equation relating the number of hydrogen atoms in the two components of mixture X. Solving this equation will give the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules, which is the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by following a logical deduction based on the provided information.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.\n    # Z is a hydrocarbon (CnHm) with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    # Mass fraction H = (mass of H) / (total mass)\n    # Using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1:\n    # 0.1428 is approximately 1/7.\n    # For a formula CnHm, the mass fraction of H is m / (12n + m).\n    # m / (12n + m) = 1/7  => 7m = 12n + m => 6m = 12n => m = 2n.\n    # The formula for Z is CnH2n.
