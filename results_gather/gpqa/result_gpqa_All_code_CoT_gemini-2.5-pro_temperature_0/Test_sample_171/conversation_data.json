    "This problem can be solved by applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_j`) to a lower state (`N_i`) is given by:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `g` represents the statistical weights of the levels, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars:** We can write this equation for each star:\n    *   Star 1: `(N_j / N_i)_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   Star 2: `(N_j / N_i)_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n    (Here, `C` is the constant ratio of statistical weights `g_j / g_i`).\n\n3.  **Using the Problem's Condition:** We are told that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This means:\n    `(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2`\n\n4.  **Combining the Equations:**\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n    The constant `C` cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n5.  **Solving for Temperature:** To solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    Using logarithm rules, this simplifies to:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n    Rearranging the terms to solve for `ln(2)`:\n    `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ((T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Using the Given Values:** The problem provides `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`. This means the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1.\n\n7.  **Final Result:** Substituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1` into our equation gives the final relationship:\n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n    This matches option D.\n\nThe following Python code will print the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks to identify the correct equation relating the temperatures\n# of two stars, T_1 and T_2, based on the excitation of iron atoms.\n\n# Step 1: Define the relationship from the problem statement.\n# The excitation ratio in star 1 is twice that in star 2.\n# Let R be the excitation ratio (N_excited / N_lower_state).\n# R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n# Step 2: Use the Boltzmann equation for the excitation ratio R.\n# R = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T)), where C is a constant (g_j/g_i).\n# For star 1: R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n# For star 2: R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n# Step 3: Substitute the Boltzmann equations into the relationship from Step 1.\n# C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n# The constant C cancels out.\n# exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n# Step 4: Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2 by taking the natural log.\n# ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))\n# -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))\n# -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n# Step 5: Rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2).\n# ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n# ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n# ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n\n# Step 6: Use the given physical constants.\n# ΔE is given as approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.\n# The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n# Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n\n# Step 7: Substitute this value into the equation.\n# ln(2) = 1 * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n# ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n# Step 8: Compare this result with the given options.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\",\n    \"B\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\",\n    \"C\": \"ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\",\n    \"D\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\"\n}\n\n# The derived equation matches option D.\ncorrect_option = \"D\"\n\nprint(\"The derivation leads to the equation: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"The correct choice is: {options[correct_option]}\")\nprint(\"<<<D>>>\")\n```"
