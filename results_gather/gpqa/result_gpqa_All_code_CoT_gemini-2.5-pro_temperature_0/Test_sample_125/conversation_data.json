    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** I will determine the structure of the starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and predict the products formed when it is reduced with LAH. This involves identifying any new chiral centers created and determining the stereochemical relationship between the products (e.g., enantiomers, diastereomers).\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** I will analyze the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4. I will determine the stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol, identifying any enantiomeric pairs or meso compounds.\n3.  **Count the Products:** I will count the total number of unique stereoisomers produced from both reactions combined.\n4.  **Predict Normal-Phase HPLC Results:** I will determine the number of peaks expected on a normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column. This type of chromatography separates constitutional isomers and diastereomers but does not resolve enantiomers.\n5.  **Predict Chiral HPLC Results:** I will determine the number of peaks expected on a chiral HPLC column. This technique can separate all different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n6.  **Select the Answer:** Finally, I will match the predicted number of peaks for both HPLC methods to the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and provides the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis of two chemical reactions\n    and predicts the number of peaks observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step analysis of the problem:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.\")\n    print(\"Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\")\n    print(\"The starting material is a ketone with an existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has an (S) configuration.\")\n    print(\"LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, creating a new chiral center at C3.\")\n    print(\"Because a new chiral center is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the two products are diastereomers.\")\n    print(\"The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\")\n    print(\"Result of Reaction I: 2 products (a pair of diastereomers).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.\")\n    print(\"Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\")\n    print(\"The starting material, pentane-2,4-dione, is an achiral molecule.\")\n    print(\"NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, creating the product pentane-2,4-diol, which has two new chiral centers (C2 and C4).\")\n    print(\"The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\")\n    print(\"- (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are a pair of enantiomers.\")\n    print(\"- (2R, 4S) is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral.\")\n    print(\"Result of Reaction II: 3 products (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Combine products\n    print(\"Step 3: Combine the products from both reactions.\")\n    print(\"The final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 unique stereoisomers.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Predict Normal-Phase HPLC results\n    print(\"Step 4: Predict the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\")\n    print(\"Normal-phase (achiral) HPLC separates compounds with different physical properties (like polarity).
