    "My plan to identify compound E is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Compound A**: I will use Hint (a), which describes a Wittig reaction. By reversing this reaction, I can determine the structure of the starting carbonyl compound, A.\n2.  **Verify the Structure of A**: I will use the IR data from Hint (b) to confirm the ring size of compound A. Ketones in five-membered rings have a characteristic C=O stretching frequency around 1750 cm⁻¹, which is different from other ring sizes.\n3.  **Trace the Reaction Sequence**: I will follow the reaction from A to E.\n    *   A → B: Cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   B → C: Reduction of the nitrile to a primary amine.\n    *   C → D → E: Diazotization of the primary amine followed by a Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement. This type of rearrangement typically involves ring expansion.\n4.  **Determine the Structure of E**: I will analyze the Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement to predict the structure of the resulting ketone, E, including the new ring size and the position of the substituents.\n5.  **Verify the Structure of E**: I will use the IR data for E from Hint (b) (~1715 cm⁻¹), which is characteristic of a six-membered ring ketone (cyclohexanone), to confirm my predicted structure.\n6.  **Select the Final Answer**: I will compare my deduced structure for E with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct match.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# Step 1: Deduce the structure of Compound A from Hint (a).\n# The reaction is a Wittig reaction.
