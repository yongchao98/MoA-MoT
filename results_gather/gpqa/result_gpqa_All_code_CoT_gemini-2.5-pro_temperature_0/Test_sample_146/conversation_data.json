    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The core principle is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n2.  **Calculate the initial energy ($E_{initial}$):** The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both particles are effectively at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV, and an antiproton has the same rest mass.\n3.  **Calculate the final energy ($E_{final}$):** The final state consists of four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). The total final energy is the sum of the energies of these four particles. By symmetry, each of these four particles will have the same energy, which we'll call $E_A$. So, $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n4.  **Equate initial and final energies:** From the conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$. This allows us to solve for the energy of a single particle A, $E_A$.\n5.  **Relate energy to velocity:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $m_A c^2$ is the rest mass energy of particle A (given as 300 MeV). We can use this to calculate $\\gamma$.\n6.  **Solve for velocity:** The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the velocity, $v$, as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$.\n7.  **Compare with options:** Finally, I will compare the calculated velocity with the given multiple-choice options to determine the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given physical constants in units of MeV.\n# Rest mass energy of a proton (and antiproton).\nmp_c2 = 938.27\n# Rest mass energy of particle A.\nmA_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total initial energy.\n# The system starts with a proton and an antiproton, both considered at rest.\n# E_initial = (m_p * c^2) + (m_p_bar * c^2)\nE_initial = 2 * mp_c2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the energy of a single final particle A.\n# The initial energy is equally distributed among the four final particles (2 A+ and 2 A-).\n# E_initial = 4 * E_A\nE_A = E_initial / 4\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for particle A.\n# The total energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m * c^2.\n# So, gamma = E_A / (m_A * c^2).\ngamma = E_A / mA_c2\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the velocity v as a fraction of c (beta = v/c).\n# The Lorentz factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2).\n# Rearranging for v/c gives: v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\n# Step 6: Print the result and the options.\nprint(f\"The calculated velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c.\")\nprint(\"Comparing this to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 0.86c\")\nprint(\"B) 0.96c\")\nprint(\"C) 0.77c\")\nprint(\"D) 0.91c\")\nprint(\"The calculated value matches option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
