    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the major isomer of product 3.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction Sequence:**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: Cyclooctatetraene + Maleic Anhydride → Product 1**\n    *   This is a Diels-Alder reaction. Cyclooctatetraene first undergoes a thermal valence isomerization to its reactive form, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene.\n    *   Maleic anhydride is a *cis*-dienophile. This is a crucial point, as the stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained in the product. Therefore, the two groups derived from the anhydride (which will become ester groups later) must be *cis* to each other in the final product.\n    *   Let's examine the options based on this fact. The two ester groups are on carbons 10 and 11.\n        *   A, C, D: (10S, 11R) - This configuration is *cis*.\n        *   B: (10R, 11R) - This configuration is *trans*.\n    *   Therefore, **Option B can be eliminated** because it does not have the correct *cis* stereochemistry originating from maleic anhydride.\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is also stereoselective. Under thermal conditions (heating), the kinetically favored *endo* product is predominantly formed. In this adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the cyclobutene ring of the bicyclo[4.2.0]octatriene skeleton.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Methanol/H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification. The anhydride ring is opened by two molecules of methanol to form a dimethyl ester.\n    *   This reaction does not affect the stereocenters of the carbon skeleton. Product 2 is a dimethyl ester with the two ester groups in a *cis* relationship, and these groups are *anti* to the cyclobutene ring.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Cyclopentadiene → Product 3**\n    *   This is a second Diels-Alder reaction. Product 2 acts as the dienophile (using its cyclobutene double bond), and cyclopentadiene is the diene.\n    *   This reaction is also governed by the *endo* rule for kinetic control. The cyclopentadiene will add to the less sterically hindered face of the cyclobutene double bond, which is the face opposite to the bulky part of the molecule containing the ester groups.\n    *   The *endo* transition state places the methylene bridge of the cyclopentadiene on the same side as the ester groups.\n    *   Therefore, the major final product (Product 3) is the *endo,endo* adduct, characterized by a *syn* relationship between the ethano-diester bridge (from the first reaction) and the methano bridge (from the second reaction).\n\n**Identifying the Correct Structure:**\n\nNow we must identify which of the remaining options (A, C, D) represents this *syn* (*endo,endo*) isomer. By inspecting the 3D structures corresponding to the provided names and SMILES strings:\n\n*   **Structure A** shows the ethano-diester bridge and the methano bridge on the **same side** of the central ring system. This is the *syn* isomer, consistent with the expected *endo,endo* kinetic product.\n*   **Structures C and D** both show the ethano-diester bridge and the methano bridge on **opposite sides** of the central ring system. These are *anti* isomers, which would be minor products.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the principles of stereoselectivity in consecutive Diels-Alder reactions, the major product is the *syn* isomer, which corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the solution based on the chemical reasoning outlined above.\n\n# Step 1: The reaction starts with maleic anhydride, a cis-dienophile.\n# This means the resulting dicarboxylate groups must be cis.\n# Option B has a trans-dicarboxylate configuration and is therefore incorrect.\n\n# Step 2: The two sequential Diels-Alder reactions are under kinetic control,\n# favoring the 'endo' transition state in both cases.\n\n# Step 3: This 'endo,endo' reaction pathway results in a final product where the\n# ethano-dicarboxylate bridge and the methano bridge are on the same side\n# of the molecule (a 'syn' relationship).\n\n# Step 4: Analysis of the provided stereoisomers reveals that only structure A\n# has this 'syn' configuration. Structures C and D are 'anti' isomers.\n\n# Step 5: Therefore, the major isomer formed is A.\n\nmajor_isomer_choice = \"A\"\nname = \"dimethyl (1S,4R,4aR,4bR,5S,8R,8aS,8bS,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate\"\nsmiles = \"O=C(OC)[C@@H]1[C@@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@H]4[C@@H]3[C@H]5C=C[C@@H]4C5)[C@@H]2[C@@H]1C(OC)=O\"\n\nprint(f\"The major isomer of product 3 is choice {major_isomer_choice}.\")\nprint(f\"Name: {name}\")\nprint(f\"SMILES: {smiles}\")\nprint(f\"<<<{major_isomer_choice}>>>\")\n```"
