    "An optically active compound must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound step-by-step.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. This molecule has no chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The molecule itself is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer (an enantiomer). A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3. Such a compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair (the other being the (2S,3S) enantiomer). Therefore, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1, which is a chiral center (bonded to H, OH, C2, and C6, which are all different). Since a single enantiomer is specified, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation, but this does not make it achiral. Since it is not superimposable on its mirror image (the all-trans isomer), it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are 4 optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef count_optically_active_compounds():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are\n    optically active based on their structural properties and stereochemical descriptors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a meso compound.\n    # Chiral molecules are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    compounds_analysis = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\",\n            \"is_active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Achiral.
