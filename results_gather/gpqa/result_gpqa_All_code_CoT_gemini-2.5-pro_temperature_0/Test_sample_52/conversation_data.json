    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** We will break down the information from FTIR and 1H NMR to identify the key structural fragments of the molecule.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The presence of only two signals for aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which gives a `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** There are two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the `-CH3` is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment is a propenyl group, `C3H5`.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are two `-CH3` signals. We've already identified one in the propenyl group. This means there is one other `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No -CH2- Groups:** This is a critical constraint that helps eliminate potential structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:** We will combine the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and count the atoms to find its chemical formula.\n    *   Fragment 1: `C6H4` (para-substituted benzene ring)\n    *   Fragment 2: `-COO-` (ester group)\n    *   Fragment 3: `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl group)\n    *   Fragment 4: `-CH3` (a second methyl group)\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the other methyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the other methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester)\n\n    The assembled formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** We'll calculate the DoU from both the structure and the formula to ensure they match.\n    *   **DoU from structure:** 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6\n    *   **DoU from formula C11H12O2:** `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6`\n    The DoU values match, confirming our structure is plausible.\n\n4.  **Select the Final Answer:** We will compare our derived formula with the given options. The formula C11H12O2 corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the information to identify molecular fragments.\n# Aromatic ring: Di-substituted with 2 H signals implies a para-substituted C6H4 ring.\n# FTIR: An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n# Vinyl group: A doublet and a doublet of quartets in the vinyl region indicates a -CH=CH-CH3 group.\n# Methyl groups: Two -CH3 signals are observed. One is part of the -CH=CH-CH3 group, so there is one additional -CH3 group.\n# No -CH2- groups are present.\n\n# Step 2: Assemble the fragments and calculate the molecular formula.\n# Fragment 1: C6H4 (ring)\n# Fragment 2: COO (ester)\n# Fragment 3: C3H5 (from -CH=CH-CH3)\n# Fragment 4: CH3 (the second methyl group)\n\n# Calculate the total number of atoms\nnum_carbons = 6 + 1 + 3 + 1\nnum_hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3\nnum_oxygens = 2\n\nformula = f\"C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}O{num_oxygens}\"\n\n# Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).\n# DoU from structure = 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6\n# DoU from formula = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n# The DoU matches, confirming the formula.\n\n# Step 4: Compare the result with the given options.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C12H14O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C12H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C11H12O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C11H14O2\"\n}\n\nfinal_answer = \"\"\nfor choice, f in options.items():\n    if f == formula:\n        final_answer = choice\n        break\n\nprint(f\"Based on the spectroscopic data, the fragments of the molecule are:\")\nprint(\"- A para-substituted aromatic ring (C6H4)\")\nprint(\"- An ester group (COO)\")\nprint(\"- A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3, which is C3H5)\")\nprint(\"- An additional methyl group (CH3)\")\nprint(\"\\nSumming the atoms from these fragments:\")\nprint(f\"Carbons: 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 = {num_carbons}\")\nprint(f\"Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = {num_hydrogens}\")\nprint(f\"Oxygens: 2\")\nprint(f\"The resulting molecular formula is {formula}.\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {final_answer}.\")\nprint(f\"The correct choice is {final_answer}).\")\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```"
