    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify Compound X:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra:** The first step is to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. We will use the provided 1H and 13C NMR data to piece together the molecule's structure.\n    *   **13C NMR Analysis:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O). The signals in the δ 126-145 ppm range are typical for aromatic and alkene carbons. The presence of two signals integrating to 2 carbons each (δ 126.9 and 129.1) strongly suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The signals at δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm are in the aliphatic region and correspond to two different methyl (CH3) groups.\n    *   **1H NMR Analysis:** The pair of doublets at δ 7.08 (2H) and δ 7.71 (2H) is a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring. The two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H) confirm the presence of two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. One of these must be the substituent on the para-position of the benzene ring, forming a para-tolyl group. The other must be attached to a part of the molecule with no adjacent protons, such as the ketone's carbonyl carbon (an acetyl group). The two doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) indicate two protons on a double bond that are coupled to each other, part of a conjugated system.\n    *   **Structure Assembly:** Combining these pieces—a para-tolyl group, a ketone, a disubstituted double bond, and an acetyl methyl group—the only structure that fits all the data is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n2.  **Relate Product to Starting Material (Compound X):** The reaction is a rearrangement, meaning the product has the same molecular formula (C11H12O) as the starting material, Compound X. The atoms are simply rearranged.\n    *   The product, 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, contains a **para-tolyl group** (a toluene ring substituted at the 4-position).\n    *   Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a para-tolyl group.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:** We will now examine the given options to see which one has the required para-tolyl group.\n    *   A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n    *   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n    *   C) 2-styrylepoxide: Ambiguous name, but typically implies a phenyl group. Also, the most likely structure (2-styryloxirane) has a formula of C10H10O, which does not match.\n    *   D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: The name \"4-methylstyryl\" explicitly indicates a styryl group with a methyl at the 4-position of the benzene ring. This is a **para-tolyl group**. This is the only option that matches the skeleton of the product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the structural analysis, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the product's NMR data to deduce its structure.\n# 1H NMR: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n# 13C NMR: δ 21.3, 28.4, 126.9 (2C), 127.1, 129.1 (2C), 130.3, 141.5, 144.1, 197.7.\n\n# Interpretation of NMR data:\n# - The 13C signal at 197.7 ppm indicates a ketone (C=O).\n# - The 1H signals at 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d) and the 13C signals at 126.9 (2C) and 129.1 (2C) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.\n# - One of the 3H singlets in the 1H NMR (e.g., 2.31 ppm) and a methyl carbon signal (e.g., 21.3 ppm) correspond to the methyl group on this ring, making it a para-tolyl group.\n# - The other 3H singlet (2.28 ppm) and methyl carbon signal (28.4 ppm) correspond to a methyl group next to the ketone, forming an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH3).\n# - The 1H signals at 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) are vinylic protons in a conjugated system.\n# - The deduced product structure is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n# Step 2: Relate the product structure to the starting material options.\n# The reaction is an isomerization, so the starting material must have the same molecular skeleton as the product.\n# The product contains a para-tolyl group. Therefore, the starting material must also contain a para-tolyl group.\n\n# Step 3: Evaluate the given options.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane\", # Contains a phenyl group.\n    \"B\": \"2-methyl-3-styryloxirane\", # Contains a phenyl group.\n    \"C\": \"2-styrylepoxide\", # Contains a phenyl group and likely wrong formula.\n    \"D\": \"2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane\" # Contains a 4-methylstyryl group, which has a p-tolyl moiety.\n}\n\n# The only option with a 4-methyl (para-methyl) substituent on the benzene ring is D.\ncorrect_option = \"D\"\n\n# Step 4: Print the final answer.\nprint(\"Based on the analysis, the product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\")\nprint(\"This product contains a para-tolyl group.\")\nprint(\"Of the choices provided, only option D, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, contains a para-tolyl group.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, Compound X must be option D.\")\nprint(f\"The correct choice is: {correct_option}\")\n\n<<<D>>>\n```"
