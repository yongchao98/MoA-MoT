    "To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we need to analyze the structure of the mathematical expression provided. In quantum field theory calculations, each loop in a diagram introduces a specific factor into the amplitude's expression.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the part of the expression that depends on the number of loops. In calculations for a D-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral typically contributes a factor of `1 / (4pi)^(D/2)`.\n2.  The problem specifies a four-dimensional spacetime, so we set D=4. This means each loop contributes a factor of `1 / (4pi)^(4/2) = 1 / (4pi)^2`.\n3.  The given expression contains the term `1/(4pi)^6`.\n4.  Let 'L' be the number of loops. The total factor from L loops would be `(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L)`.\n5.  By equating the term from the expression with the general formula, we get `(4pi)^(2L) = (4pi)^6`.\n6.  Solving the equation `2L = 6` for L will give us the number of loops.\n7.  The code will perform this simple calculation and present the result.\n\n```python\n# The expression for the size estimate of the Feynman diagram is:\n# alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2\n\n# In quantum field theory on a 4-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a\n# Feynman diagram contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2 to the overall expression\n# after integrating over the loop momentum.\n\n# If a diagram has 'L' loops, the combined factor from all loops is (1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L).\n\n# The given expression has a factor of 1/(4pi)^6.\n# We can find the number of loops, L, by equating the exponents:\n# 2 * L = 6\n\n# Let's define the exponent from the expression.\nexponent_from_expression = 6\n\n# The exponent contribution per loop is 2.\nexponent_per_loop = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of loops.\nnumber_of_loops = exponent_from_expression / exponent_per_loop\n\nprint(\"The problem is to find the number of loops in a Feynman diagram from its mathematical expression.\")\nprint(\"The key insight is that each loop in a 4D quantum field theory contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2.\")\nprint(\"The given expression contains the term 1/(4pi)^6.\")\nprint(\"Let L be the number of loops.
