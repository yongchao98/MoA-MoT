    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nDBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\nA DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the DBE and the presence of two oxygen atoms, this is very likely an ester group. The frequency is a bit low for a simple alkyl ester, suggesting conjugation with the aromatic ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which aligns with the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule contains:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an ester, but the ethyl group is on the acid side (propionate), not the alcohol side. The NMR would show a -O-C6H4-NH2 pattern, and the propionate group would have different shifts.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H peak in the IR and NMR.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a para-substituted ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the correct chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given Data\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    ir_data = [\"3420 cm-1 (N-H stretch)\", \"3325 cm-1 (N-H stretch)\", \"1720 cm-1 (C=O stretch)\"]\n    nmr_data = {\n        \"1.20 ppm\": \"t, 3H\",\n        \"4.0 ppm\": \"bs, 2H\",\n        \"4.5 ppm\": \"q, 2H\",\n        \"7.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\",\n        \"8.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\"\n    }\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"B\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\",\n        \"C\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"D\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step Analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.
