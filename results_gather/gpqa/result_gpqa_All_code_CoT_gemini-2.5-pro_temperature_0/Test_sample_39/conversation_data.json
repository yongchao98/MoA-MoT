    "The user is asking to interpret a common phrase used in a synthetic organic chemistry lab and select the best explanation from a list of choices.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. The key phrase is \"my compounds are on top of each other.\" This is a colloquialism used by chemists.\n2.  **Interpret the phrase:** \"On top of each other\" implies a failure to separate two or more substances. In a lab setting, this most often refers to a purification technique.\n3.  **Consider the most common purification technique:** The most ubiquitous purification method in synthetic organic chemistry is chromatography (e.g., Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography). In these techniques, compounds are separated and visualized as \"spots\" (on a TLC plate) or collected as fractions that correspond to \"peaks\" (on a chromatogram from HPLC or GC). If the compounds are not separated, their spots or peaks will overlap, literally appearing \"on top of each other.\"\n4.  **Identify the principle of chromatography:** Standard chromatography separates compounds based on their differential polarity. A mixture is passed through a stationary phase (often polar, like silica gel) using a mobile phase (a solvent). Compounds with different polarities will travel at different rates.\n5.  **Connect the problem to the principle:** If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will interact with the stationary and mobile phases in almost the same way. They will travel at the same rate, and thus will not be separated. This perfectly explains why they would be \"on top of each other.\"\n6.  **Evaluate the other options:**\n    *   A) Similar optical rotations are a property of chiral molecules but not the basis for most common separation techniques.\n    *   B) While non-covalent interactions are related to polarity, \"similar polarities\" is the more direct and specific cause for failed chromatographic separation.\n    *   D) Similar boiling points would be a problem for separation by distillation, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of overlapping spots in chromatography.\n7.  **Conclusion:** The most likely reason is that the compounds have similar polarities, leading to a failed chromatographic separation. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_chemistry_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a common phrase from a chemistry lab to determine the underlying scientific issue.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"What is the second chemist most likely referring to when they say their 'compounds are on top of each other'?\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.\",\n        \"B\": \"The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.\",\n        \"C\": \"The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.\",\n        \"D\": \"The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.\"\n    }\n\n    # Explanation of the reasoning\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    In the context of a synthetic organic chemistry lab, the phrase 'on top of each other' is a common colloquialism for a failed purification attempt, specifically using chromatography (like Thin Layer Chromatography or column chromatography).\n\n    1.  Chromatography separates compounds based on a physical property. In the most common forms, this property is polarity.\n    2.  Compounds are visualized as spots or peaks. If they are not separated, these spots/peaks overlap, appearing 'on top of each other'.\n    3.  This happens when the compounds have very similar polarities, causing them to move through the chromatography system at the same rate.\n    4.  While similar boiling points (D) make separation by distillation difficult, the phrase itself is much more characteristic of a chromatographic result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    correct_choice = \"C\"\n\n    print(question)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}) {value}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {correct_choice}\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_riddle()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
