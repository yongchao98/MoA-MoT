    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its orbital distance (a) from its star, assuming constant stellar luminosity and planetary albedo. This can be written as: T_eq ∝ 1 / √a.\n2.  **Formulate the temperature ratio.** For two planets, Planet_4 and Planet_2, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is T_4 / T_2 = (1/√a_4) / (1/√a_2) = √(a_2 / a_4).\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law.** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), which is the orbital distance for a circular orbit. This is expressed as P² ∝ a³. From this, we can derive the relationship for the orbital distance: a ∝ P^(2/3).\n4.  **Relate the distance ratio to the period ratio.** Using the relationship from Kepler's Law, the ratio of the orbital distances is a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3).\n5.  **Combine the formulas.** Substitute the expression for the distance ratio into the temperature ratio formula:\n    T_4 / T_2 = √((P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)) = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2)) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3).\n6.  **Calculate the final value.** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the period for Planet_2 (P_2) is 2 units, and the period for Planet_4 (P_4) is 3.5 units. We will plug these values into the derived formula and calculate the result using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of orbital periods for the planets are given.\n# Planet_1: 1\n# Planet_2: 2\n# Planet_3: 2.5\n# Planet_4: 3.5\n# Planet_5: 5\n\n# Assign the period ratio values for Planet 2 and Planet 4\nP2_ratio = 2.0\nP4_ratio = 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T4 / T2) is related to the\n# ratio of their orbital periods (P2 / P4) by the formula:\n# T4 / T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods\nperiod_ratio_2_over_4 = P2_ratio / P4_ratio\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\ntemperature_ratio_4_over_2 = period_ratio_2_over_4 ** (1/3)\n\n# The given options are:\n# A) ~0.75\n# B) ~0.69\n# C) ~0.57\n# D) ~0.83\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of the orbital periods (P2/P4) is: {period_ratio_2_over_4:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T4/T2) is: {temperature_ratio_4_over_2:.4f}\")\nprint(\"Comparing this result to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~0.75\")\nprint(\"B) ~0.69\")\nprint(\"C) ~0.57\")\nprint(\"D) ~0.83\")\nprint(\"The calculated value is approximately 0.83, which corresponds to option D.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe correct choice is D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
