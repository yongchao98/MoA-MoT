    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel):** I will use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, since both astronauts are moving in the same direction. The formula is:\n    `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n    I will substitute the given speeds `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c` into this formula to find the relative speed.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E_total):** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts (`E_total = E1 + E2`). The relativistic energy for each astronaut is given by `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    *   First, I'll calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ1`) for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c).\n    *   Then, I'll calculate their energy (`E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c^2`).\n    *   Next, I'll calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ2`) for the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c).\n    *   Then, I'll calculate their energy (`E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c^2`).\n    *   Finally, I'll add `E1` and `E2` to get the total energy of the system.\n\n3.  **Compare and Select the Answer:** I will compare my calculated values for `v_rel` and `E_total` with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Let c = 1 and m = 1 for calculation purposes. The final answer will be in terms of c and mc^2.\nc = 1\nm = 1\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate Relative Speed (v_rel) ---\n# Formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)\nv_rel_numerator = v1 - v2\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - (v1 * v2) / (c**2)\nv_rel = v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate Total Energy (E_total) ---\n# Energy formula: E = gamma * m * c^2\n# Lorentz factor (gamma) formula: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\n# Energy of Astronaut 1 (E1)\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1**2 / c**2))\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * (c**2)\n\n# Energy of Astronaut 2 (E2)\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2**2 / c**2))\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * (c**2)\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\n# --- Step 3: Compare and Print the Result ---\nprint(\"Calculations:\")\nprint(f\"Relative speed (v_rel) = {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Total energy (E) = {E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\")\nprint(f\"B) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\")\nprint(f\"C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\")\nprint(f\"D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option B.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice:\")\nprint(\"B\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
