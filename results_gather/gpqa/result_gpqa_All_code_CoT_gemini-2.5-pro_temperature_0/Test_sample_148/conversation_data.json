    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, but both have the *same mass spectrum*, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This is a critical piece of information. It tells us that the two species being observed are **isomers**â€”molecules with the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. This immediately rules out explanations involving molecules of a different mass.\n    *   **Option B (Precursor Contamination):** A precursor would have a different chemical structure and almost certainly a different mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Option D ('Double Coupling'):** This side reaction would create a larger molecule with a higher mass. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data:** We are left with options A (diastereoisomers) and C (enantiomers).\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for the same proton.\n    *   The LC separates the compound into two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Option C (Enantiomers):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral environment (like a typical NMR solvent or a standard LC column), they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a *single* peak in the NMR and a *single* peak in the LC. To distinguish them, you would need a chiral environment (e.g., a chiral LC column or a chiral shift reagent in the NMR). Since this is not mentioned, we can conclude the species are not enantiomers.\n    *   **Option A (Diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. This means they will have different NMR spectra (giving two sets of peaks) and can be separated by standard chromatography (giving two LC peaks). This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the observations.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:** The two species are isomers (same mass) but are not enantiomers (as they are distinguishable by standard NMR and LC). Therefore, they must be diastereoisomers. In the context of a peptide, this is very commonly caused by restricted rotation around an amide (peptide) bond, leading to a mixture of *cis* and *trans* isomers. These *cis/trans* isomers are a type of diastereomer, and they often interconvert slowly enough to be observed as separate species by NMR and LC.\n\n```python\n# The problem describes a situation where a single compound gives rise to two distinct species that can be observed separately.\n# Let's analyze the evidence to select the best explanation.\n\n# Evidence 1: Both species have the same mass spectrum (LC-MS).\n# This means they are isomers (same molecular formula).\n# This rules out Option B (precursor) and Option D (double coupling product), as they would have different masses.\n\n# Evidence 2: The two species are separated by LC and show distinct peaks in the 1H NMR.\n# This means they have different physical properties.\n# Enantiomers (Option C) have identical properties in an achiral environment and would not be separated by standard LC or distinguished by standard NMR.\n# Diastereoisomers (Option A) have different physical properties and would be separated by LC and show different NMR spectra.\n\n# Conclusion: The only explanation that fits all the evidence is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n# In peptides, this is often due to cis/trans isomerism around an amide bond.\n\ncorrect_answer = 'A'\n\nprint(\"Based on the analysis of the NMR and LC-MS data, the most likely explanation is:\")\nprint(f\"Choice {correct_answer}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
