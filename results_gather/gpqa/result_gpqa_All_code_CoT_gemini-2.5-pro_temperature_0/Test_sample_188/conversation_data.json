    "My plan is to analyze each of the given particles (Pion, Phonon, Magnon, Skyrmion) and determine its physical origin. The core concept here is Goldstone's Theorem, which states that spontaneously breaking a continuous symmetry results in the appearance of massless (or nearly massless) excitations known as Goldstone bosons. I will check if each particle is a Goldstone boson.\n\n1.  **Pion:** I will check its role in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and its relation to chiral symmetry breaking.\n2.  **Phonon:** I will analyze its origin in crystal lattices and its connection to translational symmetry.\n3.  **Magnon:** I will examine its role in magnetic materials (like ferromagnets) and its relation to rotational symmetry of spin.\n4.  **Skyrmion:** I will investigate its nature as a topological excitation and determine if it fits the description of a Goldstone boson.\n\nThe particle that is not a Goldstone boson resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking will be the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_particle_physics_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n    This function explains the physical origin of each particle in the list and\n    determines which one is not a Goldstone boson resulting from spontaneous\n    symmetry breaking (SSB).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The question asks to identify which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\")\n    print(\"This is closely related to Goldstone's Theorem, which states that SSB of a continuous symmetry gives rise to massless particles called Goldstone bosons.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's analyze each option:\")\n\n    # Dictionary to hold information about each particle\n    particles = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"name\": \"Pion\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Pions are the pseudo-Goldstone bosons that arise from the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
