    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Construct the Operator:** First, we will construct the matrix representation of the operator $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$. The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so in spherical coordinates, we can represent it as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle with the z-axis. The operator $P_{\\vec{n}}$ is the dot product $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$.\n2.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:** We are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_{\\vec{n}}|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$.\n3.  **Solve for the Eigenvector:** We will solve the system of linear equations resulting from the eigenvalue equation to find the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$ of the eigenvector.\n4.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:** The eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its inner product with itself is 1 (i.e., $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$). We will apply this condition to find the exact values of $a$ and $b$.\n5.  **Compare with Options:** Finally, we will compare our calculated normalized eigenvector with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nI will now write the Python code to perform these calculations symbolically.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_eigenvector_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the normalized eigenvector for a quantum operator P along a direction n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the operator matrix (we can ignore the constant hbar/2 for finding the eigenvector)\n    # The direction vector n is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta))\n    # The operator P_n is proportional to sigma_x*sin(theta) + sigma_z*cos(theta)\n    theta = sympy.Symbol('theta')\n    \n    # Matrix is [[cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)]]\n    # We need to solve M*v = 1*v, where v = [a, b]\n    \n    # Step 2 & 3: Set up and solve the system of equations\n    # a*cos(theta) + b*sin(theta) = a\n    # a*sin(theta) - b*cos(theta) = b\n    # From the first equation, we solve for the ratio b/a\n    # b*sin(theta) = a*(1 - cos(theta))\n    # b/a = (1 - cos(theta)) / sin(theta)\n    \n    # Let's represent the unnormalized eigenvector as [1, b/a]\n    a_un = 1\n    b_un = (1 - sympy.cos(theta)) / sympy.sin(theta)\n    \n    # We can simplify b_un using half-angle identities\n    # 1 - cos(theta) = 2*sin(theta/2)**2\n    # sin(theta) = 2*sin(theta/2)*cos(theta/2)\n    # So, b_un simplifies to tan(theta/2)\n    t2 = sympy.Symbol('theta/2')\n    b_un_simplified = sympy.tan(t2)\n    \n    # So, the unnormalized eigenvector is proportional to [1, tan(theta/2)]\n    \n    # Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector\n    # The norm squared is a_un**2 + b_un**2 = 1**2 + tan(theta/2)**2 = sec(theta/2)**2\n    # The normalization constant N is 1 / sqrt(sec(theta/2)**2) = |cos(theta/2)|\n    # We choose the positive root, N = cos(theta/2)\n    \n    norm_factor = sympy.cos(t2)\n    \n    # The normalized components are:\n    a_norm = norm_factor * 1\n    b_norm = norm_factor * b_un_simplified # cos(theta/2) * tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)\n    \n    # The simplified normalized eigenvector components are:\n    final_a = sympy.cos(t2)\n    final_b = sympy.sin(t2)\n    \n    # Step 5: Print the result and compare with options\n    print(\"The components of the normalized eigenvector are:\")\n    print(f\"First component: {final_a}\")\n    print(f\"Second component: {final_b}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis corresponds to the form (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\")\n    print(\"Comparing this with the given options:\")\n    print(\"A) (cos(theta), exp(i*phi)*sin(theta))\")\n    print(\"B) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\")\n    print(\"C) (sqrt(2/3)*hbar, sqrt(1/3)*hbar)\")\n    print(\"D) (sqrt(2/3)*hbar*cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3)*hbar*sin(theta/2))\")\n    print(\"\\nThe correct option is B.\")\n\nsolve_eigenvector_problem()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
