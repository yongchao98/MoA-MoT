    "The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the fields observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$. This is the time at which a signal, traveling at the speed of light $c$, would have to be emitted from the charge's position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Retarded Time:** The time delay is the light travel time: $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\n2.  **Notation:** Let's use the notation from the problem description:\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the field point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** To match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator:\n    *   $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n    *   Substituting this back into the potential equations:\n        *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n        *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   Option A: Incorrect. These are static potentials.\n    *   Option B: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong ($+$ instead of $-$).\n    *   Option C: Correct. The expressions for both V and $\\vec{A}$ match our derived formulas.\n    *   Option D: Incorrect. It uses the static potential for V. Although the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct, the expression for V itself is wrong for a moving charge.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n# These are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n# The standard formulas are:\n# V(r, t) = (1 / (4*pi*epsilon_0)) * [q / (d - (d_vec . v_vec) / c)]\n# A(r, t) = (mu_0 / (4*pi)) * [q * v_vec / (d - (d_vec . v_vec) / c)]\n\n# where:\n# d_vec is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time (tr) to the observation point (r).\n# d is the magnitude of d_vec.\n# v_vec is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n# c is the speed of light.\n\n# We can rewrite the denominator:\n# d - (d_vec . v_vec) / c = (1/c) * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec)\n\n# Substituting this back into the potential equations:\n# V(r, t) = (1 / (4*pi*epsilon_0)) * [q / ((1/c) * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))]\n# V(r, t) = (q*c) / (4*pi*epsilon_0 * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\n\n# A(r, t) = (mu_0 / (4*pi)) * [q * v_vec / ((1/c) * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))]\n# A(r, t) = (mu_0 * q * c * v_vec) / (4*pi * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\n\n# Now we compare these results with the given options.\n# Option A uses static potentials, which is incorrect.\n# Option B has a '+' sign in the denominator, which is incorrect.\n# Option C matches our derived expressions for both V and A.\n# Option D uses the static potential for V, which is incorrect.\n\n# Therefore, the correct choice is C.\n\ncorrect_choice = 'C'\nprint(f\"The correct expressions for the scalar potential V and vector potential A are given in option C.\")\nprint(f\"V(r,t) = qc / (4*pi*epsilon_o * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\")\nprint(f\"A(r,t) = (mu_o * q * c * v_vec) / (4*pi * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to choice: {correct_choice}\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
