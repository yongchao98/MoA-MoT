    "This problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV`. This is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Divergence Theorem:** The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f` over a volume `V` to the surface integral of the field over the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    This theorem is powerful because it allows us to solve the problem by evaluating a simpler surface integral. Although the field `f` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), the theorem can be applied over the surface `S` where the field is well-defined.\n\n2.  **Define the Vector Field and Surface Element:**\n    *   The vector field is given by `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The integration is over the surface of a sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, `r = R`, so the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   The differential surface element vector `dS` for a sphere in spherical coordinates is directed radially outward: `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r_hat`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r_hat]`\n    *   Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    Notice that the `R^2` terms cancel out, making the result independent of the radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    *   We now need to integrate `sin(θ) dθ dφ` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration in spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    *   The integral is: `∫_0^(2π) dφ ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ`\n    *   The inner integral `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The outer integral becomes `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^(2π) = 2(2π) - 0 = 4π`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The value of the integral is `4π`. This corresponds to option C. The following Python code will use the `sympy` library to perform this integration symbolically and confirm the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import sin, pi, integrate\n\n# This problem can be solved using the Divergence Theorem, which states:\n# ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)\n# We will evaluate the surface integral on the right side.\n\n# The vector field on the surface of the sphere (radius R) is f = (1/R^2) * r_hat.\n# The differential surface element is dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r_hat.\n# The dot product f ⋅ dS simplifies to sin(θ) * dθ * dφ.\n\n# We need to integrate this over the surface of the sphere.\n# The limits for θ (polar angle) are 0 to π.\n# The limits for φ (azimuthal angle) are 0 to 2π.\n\n# Define the symbolic variables\ntheta, phi = sympy.symbols('theta phi')\n\n# The integrand is sin(theta)\nintegrand = sin(theta)\n\n# First, integrate with respect to theta from 0 to pi\nintegral_over_theta = integrate(integrand, (theta, 0, pi))\n\n# Then, integrate the result with respect to phi from 0 to 2*pi\ntotal_integral = integrate(integral_over_theta, (phi, 0, 2*pi))\n\n# The result is the value of the integral.\n# Let's compare it to the given options.\n# A) 0\n# B) 4/3 * pi * R\n# C) 4 * pi\n# D) 1\n\nprint(\"The value of the integral is:\", total_integral)\nprint(\"This corresponds to option C.\")\nprint(\"Choice: C\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
