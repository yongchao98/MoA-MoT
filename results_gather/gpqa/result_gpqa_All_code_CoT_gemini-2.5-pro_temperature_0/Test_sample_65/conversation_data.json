    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM). It includes all possible higher-dimensional operators that can be formed from the SM fields, consistent with the symmetries of the SM. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry & Poincare Symmetry:** The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory, which means it is fundamentally based on the principles of special relativity. Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations, is a fundamental spacetime symmetry of the SM. SMEFT is constructed to preserve this fundamental structure. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, thus respecting both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry.\n\n2.  **CP Symmetry (Charge-Parity):** CP symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model, specifically by a complex phase in the CKM matrix of the weak interaction. Since the SM itself violates CP, its effective field theory extension (SMEFT) is not required to preserve it. In fact, SMEFT introduces many new operators that can lead to additional sources of CP violation, which are actively searched for in experiments. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n3.  **CPT Symmetry (Charge-Parity-Time):** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be symmetric under the combined transformation of CPT. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry. Therefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n```python\ndef solve_smeft_symmetries():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n    \"\"\"\n    symmetries = {\n        1: \"Lorentz Symmetry\",\n        2: \"Poincare symmetry\",\n        3: \"CP symmetry\",\n        4: \"CPT symmetry\"\n    }\n\n    # Explanation\n    print(\"Analyzing the required symmetries for SMEFT operators:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"1. {symmetries[1]}: Required.
