    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Establish the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet orbiting a star is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a), assuming the star's properties and the planet's albedo are constant. This can be written as: T_eq ∝ 1/√a.\n2.  **Use Temperature Ratios to find the Orbital Distance Ratio:** From the relationship above, the ratio of orbital distances between two planets (j and i) can be expressed in terms of their temperature ratios: (a_j / a_i) = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)². We are given the temperature ratios between Planet1/Planet2 and Planet2/Planet3. We can combine these to find the temperature ratio between Planet1/Planet3, and then use that to find the orbital distance ratio a3/a1.\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its orbital distance (a), or P² ∝ a³. This means the orbital period is proportional to the orbital distance to the power of 3/2 (P ∝ a^(3/2)).\n4.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio:** Using the relationship from Kepler's Law, we can find the ratio of the orbital periods (P3/P1) from the ratio of the orbital distances (a3/a1) that we calculated in step 2.\n5.  **Note on Extra Information:** The problem provides mass ratios and a specific albedo value. These are not needed for the calculation because the planet masses are negligible compared to the star's mass in Kepler's law, and the albedo is the same for all three planets, so it cancels out when we take ratios.\n\nI will now implement this plan in Python to find the numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the given ratios ---\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2\nT_ratio_12 = 1.4\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3\nT_ratio_23 = 2.3\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the overall temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet3 ---\n# T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\nT_ratio_13 = T_ratio_12 * T_ratio_23\n\n# --- Step 3: Relate temperature ratio to orbital distance and period ratios ---\n# The relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and orbital distance (a) is T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a).\n# This leads to the ratio of orbital distances: a3/a1 = (T_eq1/T_eq3)^2.\n# Kepler's Third Law states P ∝ a^(3/2), where P is the orbital period.\n# Therefore, the ratio of orbital periods P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).\n# Substituting the first relation into the second gives:\n# P3/P1 = ((T_eq1/T_eq3)^2)^(3/2) = (T_eq1/T_eq3)^3\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the final factor for the orbital periods ---\nperiod_factor = T_ratio_13 ** 3\n\n# --- Step 5: Print the result and compare with the given options ---\nprint(f\"The orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately: {period_factor:.1f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result to the options provided:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 4.4\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 3.2\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 33.4\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 10.4\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value most closely matches option C.\")\n<<<C>>>\n```"
