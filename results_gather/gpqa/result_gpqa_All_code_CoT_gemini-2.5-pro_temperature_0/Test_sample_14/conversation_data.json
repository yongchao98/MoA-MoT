    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2 and find the ratio `Prob_1 / Prob_2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of a transit is the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   `Probability ∝ R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:** We need to express the semi-major axis `a` in terms of the given quantities (orbital period `P` and stellar mass `M_s`). Kepler's Third Law states:\n    *   `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n    *   Rearranging for `a`, we get: `a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\n    *   Therefore, `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine the Formulas:** Substitute the expression for `a` into the probability formula:\n    *   `Probability ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n    *   `Probability ∝ R_s / (M_s^(1/3) * P^(2/3))`\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** Now, we can write the ratio of the probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2:\n    *   `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = [R_s1 / (M_s1^(1/3) * P1^(2/3))] / [R_s2 / (M_s2^(1/3) * P2^(2/3))]`\n    *   `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Values:** From the problem description:\n    *   The stars have the same radii: `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n    *   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive: `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`, so `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`\n    *   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter: `P1 / P2 = 1/3`, so `P2 / P1 = 3`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Plug these values into the ratio formula and compute the result using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the ratios of the physical properties based on the problem description.\n# Let's denote the properties of Planet_1's system with subscript 1\n# and Planet_2's system with subscript 2.\n\n# R_s1 / R_s2: Both host stars have the same radii.\nratio_R_s = 1.0\n\n# M_s1 / M_s2: The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2.\nratio_M_s = 2.0\n\n# P1 / P2: The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2.\nratio_P = 1.0 / 3.0\n\n# The ratio of transit probabilities is given by:\n# Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)\n# This is equivalent to:\n# Ratio = (ratio_R_s) * (1 / ratio_M_s)^(1/3) * (1 / ratio_P)^(2/3)\n\n# Calculate the probability ratio\nprob_ratio = ratio_R_s * (1 / ratio_M_s)**(1/3) * (1 / ratio_P)**(2/3)\n\n# Since the ratio is greater than 1, Planet_1 is preferred.\n# We now find the closest option.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1.5,\n    \"B\": 1.65,\n    \"C\": 2.25,\n    \"D\": 2.7\n}\n\n# Find the option with the value closest to our calculated ratio\nclosest_option = min(options.keys(), key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - prob_ratio))\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to Planet_2 is: {prob_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"This means Planet_1 has a probability of transiting that is ~{prob_ratio:.2f} times higher than Planet_2.\")\nprint(f\"The closest choice is B, which states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the correct choice is B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
