    "My plan is to analyze each of the provided physical theories in the context of high-energy physics and the need for a procedure called regularization.\n\n1.  **Define Regularization:** First, I'll clarify what \"regularization\" means in this context. It's a technique used in quantum field theory to handle infinite quantities that arise in calculations, particularly those involving loops in Feynman diagrams which correspond to high-energy (or short-distance) phenomena.\n2.  **Analyze Each Option:**\n    *   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** I will check if this theory, which describes how light and matter interact, produces infinities that need regularization.\n    *   **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** I will do the same for this theory, which describes the strong nuclear force.\n    *   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** I will consider if this classical theory (Maxwell's equations) has the same kind of high-energy problems as quantum theories.\n    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** I will analyze if this modern theoretical framework is designed to avoid the high-energy infinities seen in other theories.\n3.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that stores these analyses in a data structure. The script will then iterate through the options, print the analysis for each, and programmatically determine which theory does not require regularization. Finally, it will print the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_physics_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes physical theories to determine which one does not require\n    regularization at high energies.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary to store information about each theory.\n    # The 'explanation' key is central to answering the question.\n    theories_info = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Quantum Electrodynamics',\n            'explanation': 'This is a quantum field theory (QFT).
