    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy's frame (which we can consider stationary) and the ejecta's frame (which is moving).\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity `v` between the frames is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `t0 = 50` s. This is the \"proper time\".\n    *   The speed of light `c` is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n3.  **Apply the time dilation formula:** A clock in a moving frame appears to run slower when observed from a stationary frame. The time `t` measured in the Galaxy's frame is related to the proper time `t0` by the formula:\n    `t = t0 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  **Calculate the distance:** The distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity `v` multiplied by the time `t` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `distance = v * t`\n5.  **Combine and compute:** We will substitute the time dilation formula into the distance formula and calculate the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Information ---\n# Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (v) in km/s\nv = 60000\n\n# Time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time, t0) in seconds\nt0 = 50\n\n# Speed of light (c) in km/s\nc = 300000\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Step 1: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (t)\n# According to the theory of special relativity, time in the stationary frame (Galaxy)\n# is dilated relative to the moving frame (ejecta).\n# The formula for time dilation is: t = t0 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\n# Calculate the ratio v/c squared\nv_over_c_squared = (v / c)**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the Lorentz factor\ndenominator = math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time 't' in the Galaxy's frame\nt_galaxy = t0 / denominator\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\n# The distance is the velocity (v) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (t_galaxy).\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = v * t_galaxy\n\n# --- Output the result ---\nprint(f\"The calculated time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is: {t_galaxy:.4f} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is: {distance_in_galaxy_frame:.0f} km.\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 3 000 000 km\")\nprint(\"B) 3 060 000 km\")\nprint(\"C) 2 880 000 km\")\nprint(\"D) 2 940 000 km\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated distance is closest to option B.\")\n\n# --- Final Answer ---\n# The calculated value is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n# Comparing this to the options, 3,060,000 km is the closest choice.\nfinal_choice = \"B\"\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: {final_choice}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
