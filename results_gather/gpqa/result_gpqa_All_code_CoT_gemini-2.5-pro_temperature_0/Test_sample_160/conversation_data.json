    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the definitions of λ1 and λ2.**\n    *   `λ1` is the mean free path for gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   `λ2` is the mean free path for electrons colliding with gas molecules.\n    *   The number of gas molecules per unit volume (`n`) and the temperature are the same in both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for mean free path (MFP).**\n    *   The general formula for the MFP of a particle moving through a field of target particles is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `n` is the number density of targets and `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\n3.  **Determine the formula for λ1 (gas-gas collisions).**\n    *   In a gas, the target molecules are also moving. This relative motion increases the effective collision rate, which is accounted for by a `sqrt(2)` factor in the denominator.\n    *   The collision cross-section, `σ_gg`, for two identical spherical molecules of diameter `d` colliding is `π * d^2`.\n    *   Therefore, `λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * π * d^2)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the formula for λ2 (electron-gas collisions).**\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them extremely fast compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules. Thus, we can consider the gas molecules to be stationary targets, and the `sqrt(2)` factor is not needed.\n    *   An electron's physical size is negligible compared to a gas molecule. The collision is effectively a point particle (the electron) hitting a spherical target (the gas molecule). The cross-section, `σ_eg`, is determined by the target's size, which is `π * r^2`, where `r` is the radius of the gas molecule.\n    *   Since the diameter `d = 2r`, we can write the cross-section as `σ_eg = π * (d/2)^2 = (π * d^2) / 4`.\n    *   Therefore, `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * (π * d^2) / 4) = 4 / (n * π * d^2)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio λ2 / λ1.**\n    *   `λ2 / λ1 = [4 / (n * π * d^2)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * π * d^2)]`\n    *   The `(n * π * d^2)` terms cancel out.\n    *   `λ2 / λ1 = 4 / (1 / sqrt(2)) = 4 * sqrt(2)`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the result and choose the correct option.**\n    *   `sqrt(2)` is approximately 1.414.\n    *   `λ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656`.\n    *   This means `λ2 ≈ 5.656 * λ1`.\n    *   Comparing this result to the given options, `λ2` is clearly much larger than `λ1`. Option D, `λ2 >= 1.22*λ1`, is the only one that fits this conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_microscope_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the physics of mean free path for two different scenarios\n    and determines the relationship between them.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem asks to compare λ1 (mean free path of gas-gas collisions)\n    # with λ2 (mean free path of electron-gas collisions).\n\n    # The mean free path (λ) is given by λ = 1 / (n * σ), where n is the number density\n    # of target particles and σ is the collision cross-section.
