    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** We'll start by using the information from the experiment to determine the chemical nature and amount (in moles) of each gaseous product formed when the salt mixture was heated.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ (a drying agent) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   The fact that the weight of the Ca(OH)₂ solution did not change means no acidic gases (like CO₂) were produced.\n    *   The weight increase of the red-hot copper is due to its reaction with oxygen (O₂), forming CuO. This increase is the mass of the oxygen.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, which passed through all tubes unreacted, can be identified by calculating its molar mass from the given volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). We'll also verify the law of conservation of mass.\n\n2.  **Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture:** Based on the moles of H₂O, O₂, and gas C, we can calculate the total moles of hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N) atoms in the original mixture. This will give us the overall empirical formula for the combined salts (A+B).\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:** The problem states that A and B are salts that decompose into only gaseous products. The presence of H₂O and N₂ as products strongly suggests they are ammonium salts. Since the mixture is equimolar, we can deduce the specific formulas of the two ammonium salts (A and B) that would combine to match the overall empirical formula we found.\n\n4.  **Verify the Identification:** We will use the total initial mass (7.20 g) and the fact that the mixture is equimolar to confirm that our identified salts are correct. We'll calculate the moles of the mixture.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** Once salts A and B are identified, we will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan with the Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the Products\n# Given data\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_H2O = 3.60      # g, from tube #1\nmass_O2 = 0.80       # g, from tube #3\nvolume_gas_C_STP = 2.24 # L\n\n# Molar masses and constants\nM_H = 1.008\nM_N = 14.007\nM_O = 15.999\nM_H2O = 2 * M_H + M_O\nM_O2 = 2 * M_O\nM_N2 = 2 * M_N\nV_molar_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\n\n# Calculate moles of each product\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C_STP / V_molar_STP\n\n# Check conservation of mass to identify gas C\n# Assuming gas C is N2, let's calculate its mass\nmass_gas_C_assumed_N2 = moles_gas_C * M_N2\ntotal_product_mass = mass_H2O + mass_O2 + mass_gas_C_assumed_N2\n\n# The total product mass (7.20 g) matches the initial mixture mass.\n# This confirms that gas C is Nitrogen (N2).\n\n# Step 2: Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture\n# Calculate total moles of each element from the products\nmoles_H_total = moles_H2O * 2\nmoles_O_total = moles_H2O * 1 + moles_O2 * 2\nmoles_N_total = moles_gas_C * 2\n\n# The molar ratio of elements in the mixture is H:N:O\n# H : N : O  ~=  0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25\n# To get integers, we multiply by 20, giving a ratio of 8:4:5.\n# So the overall formula of (A+B) is H8N4O5.\n\n# Step 3: Identify Salts A and B\n# The products (N2, H2O) suggest ammonium salts.\n# The overall formula H8N4O5 contains 8 H atoms, which corresponds to two ammonium ions, (NH4)2.\n# (NH4)2 = N2H8.\n# Subtracting this from the total formula leaves the anions: H8N4O5 - N2H8 = N2O5.\n# The two anions must sum to N2O5. The most common and logical choice is nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-).\n# So, Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) and Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\n\n# Step 4: Verify the Identification (optional but good practice)\nM_NH4NO3 = 2*M_N + 4*M_H + 3*M_O\nM_NH4NO2 = 2*M_N + 4*M_H + 2*M_O\n# Moles of mixture n = mass_mixture / (M_NH4NO3 + M_NH4NO2)\n# n = 7.20 / (80.04 + 64.04) = 7.20 / 144.08 ~= 0.05 mol.\n# This is consistent with our product moles:\n# moles_O2 = 0.025 mol (from 0.05 mol NH4NO3)\n# moles_N2 = 0.05 (from NH4NO3) + 0.05 (from NH4NO2) = 0.1 mol\n# moles_H2O = 0.1 (from NH4NO3) + 0.1 (from NH4NO2) = 0.2 mol\n# The identification is correct.\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n# Salt A: NH4NO3\natoms_in_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3  # N + H4 + N + O3\n# Salt B: NH4NO2\natoms_in_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2  # N + H4 + N + O2\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"Salt A is identified as Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in one formula unit of A: {atoms_in_A}\")\nprint(f\"Salt B is identified as Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2).\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in one formula unit of B: {atoms_in_B}\")\nprint(f\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n\n# Match with options\noptions = {'A': 13, 'B': 17, 'C': 19, 'D': 15}\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    if value == total_atoms:\n        final_answer = choice\n        break\n\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {final_answer}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer: {final_answer}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
