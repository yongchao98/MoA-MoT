    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Apply the Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the relativistic oscillator is constant. The total energy ($E_{total}$) is the sum of its rest energy ($mc^2$), its relativistic kinetic energy ($K$), and its potential energy ($U$).\n2.  **Calculate the Total Energy at Maximum Displacement:** At the maximum amplitude, $x=A$, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v=0$ and its kinetic energy is $K=0$. The potential energy is $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. Therefore, the total energy of the system is $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n3.  **Calculate the Total Energy at the Equilibrium Position:** At the equilibrium position, $x=0$, the potential energy is $U(0)=0$. The speed is at its maximum, $v=v_{max}$. The total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the maximum kinetic energy. In terms of the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max} = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$, the total energy is $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n4.  **Equate the Energies and Solve:** By equating the expressions for the total energy from steps 2 and 3, we can solve for $\\gamma_{max}$.\n5.  **Derive the Final Expression:** Using the relationship between $\\gamma_{max}$ and $v_{max}$, we can derive the final expression for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.\n6.  **Compare with Options:** Finally, we will compare our derived formula with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_relativistic_oscillator():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step derivation for the maximum speed\n    of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator and identifies the correct formula\n    from the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The derivation is presented as a series of print statements.\n    # The problem does not require numerical calculation, but a symbolic derivation.\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step derivation for the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Principle of Conservation of Energy\n    print(\"1.
