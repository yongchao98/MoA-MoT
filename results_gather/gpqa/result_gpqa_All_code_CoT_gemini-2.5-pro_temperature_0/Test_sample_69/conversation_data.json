    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify the compounds**: I will deduce the chemical identities of the substances labeled A through H by analyzing the described reactions one by one. The key is to find a consistent set of compounds that fits all the clues.\n2.  **Start with the clearest clues**: The reaction `D + B -> H` (where H is a solvent) and the hydrolysis reaction `C + H₂O -> A + F + G` are the most informative starting points.\n3.  **Formulate a hypothesis**: Based on common chemical reactions, I'll propose identities for the compounds. For instance, `B = Cl₂` (chlorine gas) is a good starting assumption.\n4.  **Test the hypothesis**: I will check if the proposed set of compounds is consistent with all the given information, including physical states (solid, gas), color (bright red), and properties (strong/weak acid, hazardous product).\n5.  **Identify Compound E**: Once the identities of C and D are established, I can determine the product E from the reaction `C + 2D -> E`.\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry**: After identifying the chemical structure of the hazardous product E, I will determine its molecular geometry and the corresponding point group (molecular symmetry group).\n7.  **Select the Final Answer**: I will match the determined point group with the given options (A, B, C, D).\n\n**Execution of the plan:**\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)`**\n    Let's assume `B` is chlorine (`Cl₂`). A common reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene (`C₂H₄`).\n    `C₂H₄ (g) + Cl₂ (g) -> C₂H₄Cl₂ (l)`\n    Here, `D = C₂H₄` (ethene), `B = Cl₂` (chlorine), and `H = C₂H₄Cl₂` (1,2-dichloroethane), which is a common solvent. This is a very strong fit.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This is a hydrolysis reaction where `C` disproportionates to reform `A`. This suggests `A` is an element. If `B` is `Cl₂`, then `C` is likely a chloride. The formation of a strong acid `F` points to `HCl`.\n    Let's test sulfur chlorides. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O -> S + SO₂ + 4HCl`\n    In this reaction:\n    *   `A` is elemental sulfur (`S`), a solid.\n    *   `F` is hydrochloric acid (`HCl`), a strong acid.\n    *   `G` is sulfurous acid (`H₂SO₃`), a weak acid formed when `SO₂` dissolves in water.\n    This fits the description perfectly. So, we can identify `C = SCl₂`.\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    This would be `S (s) + 8Cl₂ (g) -> SCl₂ (bright red)`. Sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is indeed a cherry-red liquid. However, the stoichiometry is incorrect (the actual reaction is `S + Cl₂ -> SCl₂`). Given that all other clues fit so well, we will assume the \"8 equivalents\" is an error in the problem statement.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    Using our identified compounds:\n    `SCl₂ (C) + 2C₂H₄ (D) -> E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **mustard gas**, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ -> S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n    Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. Thus, `E` is mustard gas.\n\n*   **Final Step: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E (Mustard Gas)**\n    The molecule `E` is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The central sulfur atom is bonded to two `-CH₂CH₂Cl` groups and has two lone pairs, resulting in a bent geometry around the sulfur.\n    *   The molecule is not planar due to rotations around the single bonds.\n    *   The most stable conformation of the molecule is chiral (lacks any mirror planes or an inversion center) but possesses a two-fold rotational axis (`C₂`) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides identity) is a `C₂` axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2v\nC) C2\nD) D∞h\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the compounds based on the chemical clues.\n# A = S (Sulfur)\n# B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n# C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n# D = C₂H₄ (Ethene)\n# E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard gas)\n# F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n# G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n# H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n# Step 2: Determine the molecular symmetry group of compound E (Mustard Gas).\n# Mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, has a bent structure at the sulfur atom.\n# Due to the arrangement of the ethyl chloride chains, the molecule is not planar and lacks mirror planes.\n# Its most stable conformation possesses a C₂ rotational axis.\n# A molecule with only identity (E) and a C₂ axis belongs to the C₂ point group.\n\n# Step 3: Match the result with the given options.\n# A) D4h\n# B) C2v\n# C) C2\n# D) D∞h\n# The correct option is C.\n\nfinal_choice = 'C'\nprint(f\"The molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C2.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct option is {final_choice}.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
