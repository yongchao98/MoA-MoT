    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is the plan to solve this electrochemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Thermodynamic Analysis**: I will compare the standard reduction potential (E°) of oxygen in acidic solution to its potential in basic solution. A higher, more positive E° indicates a stronger oxidizing agent. This will determine if oxygen is a \"weaker\" or \"stronger\" oxidant in basic solutions.\n2.  **Kinetic Analysis**: I will explain the nature of the oxygen reduction reaction. The rate of a reaction is a matter of kinetics. I will consider the activation energy and the reaction mechanism for the reduction of O₂ to determine if it is generally \"faster\" or \"slower\".\n3.  **Conclusion**: By combining the findings from the thermodynamic and kinetic analyses, I will select the correct option from the choices provided.\n\n```python\ndef solve_electrochemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of oxygen as an oxidant\n    to determine the correct statement.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part 1: Thermodynamic Analysis\n    # The strength of an oxidant is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°).\n    # A more positive E° means a stronger oxidant.\n\n    # Reaction in acidic solution: O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    E_acidic = 1.23  # Volts\n\n    # Reaction in basic solution: O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    E_basic = 0.40  # Volts\n\n    print(\"--- Thermodynamic Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Standard reduction potential of O2 in acidic solution (E°_acid): {E_acidic} V\")\n    print(f\"Standard reduction potential of O2 in basic solution (E°_basic): {E_basic} V\")\n\n    # Compare the potentials\n    if E_basic < E_acidic:\n        thermodynamic_property = \"weaker\"\n        print(f\"Since E°_basic ({E_basic} V) is less positive than E°_acid ({E_acidic} V), oxygen is a thermodynamically WEAKER oxidant in basic solutions.\")\n    else:\n        thermodynamic_property = \"stronger\"\n        print(f\"Since E°_basic ({E_basic} V) is more positive than E°_acid ({E_acidic} V), oxygen is a thermodynamically STRONGER oxidant in basic solutions.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Kinetic Analysis ---\")\n    # Part 2: Kinetic Analysis\n    # Kinetics deals with the rate of reaction.
