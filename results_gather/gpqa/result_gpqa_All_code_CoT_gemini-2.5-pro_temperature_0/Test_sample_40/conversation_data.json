    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The problem involves finding the velocity of light in a moving medium as observed from a stationary frame. This is a classic problem in special relativity that requires the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n2.  **Define the frames of reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame of the observer.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving with the glass at a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame.\n\n3.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass (S' frame) relative to the laboratory (S frame).\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (S' frame). In a medium with a refractive index `n`, the speed of light is `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, we have `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (S frame). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n4.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the known values:**\n    With `c=1` and `u' = 1/n`, the formula becomes:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    To simplify the fraction, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Match the result:**\n    This simplified expression `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` corresponds to option B.\n\n8.  **Construct the Python code:** The code will print the available choices and then print the correct choice based on the derivation.\n\n```python\n# This problem is solved using the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n# Let u be the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n# Let v be the speed of the glass relative to the laboratory.\n# Let u' be the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass itself.\n\n# According to the problem statement:\n# The speed of light in vacuum, c = 1.\n# The index of refraction of the glass is n.\n# The speed of light in the glass (in the rest frame of the glass) is u' = c/n = 1/n.\n# The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam.\n\n# The relativistic velocity addition formula is:\n# u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)\n\n# Substituting the values c=1 and u'=1/n into the formula:\n# u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)\n# u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)\n\n# To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by n:\n# u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)\n# u = (n*(1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))\n# u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)\n\n# Now, we compare this result with the given options.\noption_A = \"(1-n*v)/(n+v)\"\noption_B = \"(1+n*v)/(n+v)\"\noption_C = \"(1+n*v)/(n-v)\"\noption_D = \"1\"\n\nprint(\"The available options are:\")\nprint(f\"A) {option_A}\")\nprint(f\"B) {option_B}\")\nprint(f\"C) {option_C}\")\nprint(f\"D) {option_D}\")\nprint(\"\\nBased on the derivation using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the correct expression is (1 + n*v) / (n + v).\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option B.\")\n\n# Final Answer\ncorrect_choice = \"B\"\nprint(f\"\\nThe correct choice is: {correct_choice}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
