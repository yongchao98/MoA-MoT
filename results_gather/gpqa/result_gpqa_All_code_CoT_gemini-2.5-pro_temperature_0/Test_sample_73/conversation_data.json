    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that an atom has *not* decayed by time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = exp(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability that it *has* decayed by time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - exp(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Find the Decay Constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find `λ`.\n    *   `P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - exp(-λ * 100)`\n    *   `exp(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n    *   `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. A key property of radioactive decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of decay in a future time interval does not depend on how long the atom has already existed.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n    *   We need to calculate `P(150) = 1 - exp(-λ * 150)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will substitute the value of `λ` we found in step 2 into the formula from step 3 and compute the final probability. The Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given information\np_decay_100_min = 0.32\nt1 = 100\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the decay constant (lambda)\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - p_decay_100_min\np_survive_100_min = 1 - p_decay_100_min\n# From the survival function S(t) = exp(-lambda * t), we have:\n# p_survive_100_min = exp(-lambda * t1)\n# ln(p_survive_100_min) = -lambda * t1\n# lambda = -ln(p_survive_100_min) / t1\nlambda_val = -math.log(p_survive_100_min) / t1\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes\n# The time interval for the new decay event is t2 = 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the fact that the atom\n# has already survived 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n# We calculate the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.\nt2 = 150\np_decay_150_min = 1 - math.exp(-lambda_val * t2)\n\n# Convert the probability to a percentage\np_decay_150_percent = p_decay_150_min * 100\n\nprint(f\"The calculated probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: {p_decay_150_percent:.2f}%\")\n\n# Step 4: Compare with the given options\noptions = {'A': 40, 'B': 44, 'C': 48, 'D': 52}\n# Find the option with the minimum absolute difference from our calculated value\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - p_decay_150_percent))\n\nprint(\"\\nHere are the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 40%\")\nprint(\"B) 44%\")\nprint(\"C) 48%\")\nprint(\"D) 52%\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The correct option is {closest_option}\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
