    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem Statement:** First, we'll break down the information provided by the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This implies the mixture contains two different compounds, and each compound contributes one aromatic singlet. Since the mixture is 1:1, the number of protons for each aromatic singlet must be the same.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the combined signal from the aliphatic protons of both compounds in the mixture.\n\n2.  **Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds:** We will predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options to see what signals they would produce on their own. We'll focus on the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integration (number of protons).\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has one type of aromatic proton (2H) and one type of methyl group (12H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** It has one plane of symmetry. This results in one type of aromatic proton (2H), and three different types of methyl groups (6H, 3H, 3H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** It has one plane of symmetry. This results in one type of aromatic proton (2H) and two different types of methyl groups (6H, 6H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H, a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups, which would produce quartets and triplets in the aliphatic region, not just singlets. Therefore, it can be eliminated from consideration.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixtures (Options A-D):** We will combine the predicted spectra for the pairs of compounds in each option (assuming a 1:1 mixture) and see which one matches the observed data.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** A 1:1 mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers will produce two 2H aromatic singlets, matching the observed 1:1 ratio. So, we must use the aliphatic region to distinguish them.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** We will sum the aliphatic signals for each pair and check if the result is three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation and Final Answer:** A Python script will be used to systematically perform the analysis described above and identify the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data for a mixture of two aromatic compounds to identify them.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the provided 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region: 2 singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region: 3 singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the spectral characteristics of each candidate compound.\n    # The data is stored as: { \"aromatic_H\": count, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [list_of_H_counts] }\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 4, \"aliphatic_integrations\": \"non-singlets\"}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicted 1H NMR signals for individual compounds.\")\n    for name, data in compounds.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}:\")\n        if isinstance(data[\"aliphatic_integrations\"], list):\n            print(f\"    - Aromatic: 1 singlet ({data['aromatic_H']}H)\")\n            print(f\"    - Aliphatic: {len(data['aliphatic_integrations'])} singlet(s) with integrations {data['aliphatic_integrations']}H\")\n        else:\n            print(\"    - Aliphatic signals are not all singlets, so this compound is excluded.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Define the options and evaluate them.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\")\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluating each option for a 1:1 mixture.\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, (name1, name2) in options.items():\n        print(f\"\\nTesting Option {option}: {name1} and {name2}\")\n        comp1 = compounds[name1]\n        comp2 = compounds[name2]\n\n        # Rule out any option with 1,4-diethylbenzene\n        if comp1[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] == \"non-singlets\" or comp2[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] == \"non-singlets\":\n            print(\"  - Result: FAILED.
