    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:** I will trace the chemical transformations step by step to identify the final product.\n    *   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom will add to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon). The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heated) → Product 2.** This is a reaction of an alpha-halo ketone with a strong base. This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. In this reaction, the six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming a carboxylic acid derivative. The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3.** Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n    *   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4.** This is a bulky, mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4):** Based on the analysis, Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Its structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n3.  **Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:** Now, I will examine the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde to count the number of unique hydrogen environments, considering the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-C bond connecting it to the ring, the carbon atom it's attached to (C1), and the C1-H bond.\n    *   Let's count the distinct types of hydrogens:\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (H in -CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These are the carbons adjacent to C1. The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. Therefore, they are chemically distinct from each other. This gives us two more types of hydrogens (one set of two equivalent protons, and another set of two equivalent protons). (2 types)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These are the carbons beta to C1. The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. This gives us another two types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n4.  **Sum the types:** Total distinct types = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Identify the product of each reaction step.\n#    - Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 -> 2-bromocyclohexanone (Alpha-halogenation)\n#    - Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH/heat -> cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Favorskii rearrangement)\n#    - Step 3: cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl2 -> cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Acyl chloride formation)\n#    - Step 4: cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3 -> cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Reduction to aldehyde)\n# 2.
