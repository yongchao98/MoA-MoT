    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine which stars are observable by both spectrographs:\n\n1.  **Establish Observability Criteria:** A star must meet two conditions to be observed by *both* the ESPRESSO (Southern Hemisphere) and HIRES (Northern Hemisphere) spectrographs.\n    *   **Positional Criterion (Declination):** The star must be visible from both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. A star at declination (DEC) is visible from an observatory at latitude (Lat) if it rises above the horizon.\n        *   For Keck Observatory (Lat ~ +20° N), stars with DEC > (20° - 90°) = -70° are visible.\n        *   For Paranal Observatory (Lat ~ -25° S), stars with DEC < (-25° + 90°) = +65° are visible.\n        *   Therefore, for a star to be visible from both, its declination must be between -70° and +65°.\n    *   **Brightness Criterion (Apparent Magnitude):** The star must be bright enough for both instruments.\n        *   ESPRESSO limit: Apparent V magnitude < 17.0\n        *   HIRES limit: Apparent V magnitude < 16.0\n        *   Therefore, to be observed by both, a star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the stricter limit, i.e., **V < 16.0**.\n\n2.  **Calculate Apparent Magnitude:** For stars where the apparent magnitude is not directly given, it will be calculated using the distance modulus formula, including interstellar extinction where applicable:\n    *   `m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n    *   `m`: apparent magnitude\n    *   `M`: absolute magnitude\n    *   `d`: distance in parsecs (pc)\n    *   `A_V`: total absorption in the V band, calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Star:** Each star will be checked against both the declination and apparent magnitude criteria.\n\n4.  **Identify the Correct Pair:** The final answer will be the pair of stars that satisfy all conditions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_star_observability():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines which stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs\n    based on their declination and apparent V magnitude.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Observability Criteria ---\n    # Keck Observatory (HIRES) is at latitude ~+19.8 deg\n    # Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO) is at latitude ~-24.6 deg\n    # A star is visible if DEC > Lat - 90 (for N. hemisphere) and DEC < Lat + 90 (for S. hemisphere)\n    min_dec = 19.8 - 90  # Keck's southern limit\n    max_dec = -24.6 + 90 # Paranal's northern limit\n\n    # The magnitude limit is the stricter of the two (HIRES: V<16, ESPRESSO: V<17)\n    mag_limit = 16.0\n\n    # Extinction coefficient\n    R_V = 3.1\n\n    # --- Star Data ---\n    stars = {\n        \"Star1\": {\"dec\": -75, \"M_V\": 15.5, \"dist_pc\": 10, \"E_BV\": 0},\n        \"Star2\": {\"dec\": 55, \"m_V_given\": 16.5},\n        \"Star3\": {\"dec\": 48, \"m_V_given\": 15.5}, # Assuming given apparent mag is the final observed value\n        \"Star4\": {\"dec\": -48, \"M_V\": 15.5, \"dist_pc\": 10, \"E_BV\": 0.4},\n        \"Star5\": {\"dec\": 60, \"M_V\": 16.5, \"dist_pc\": 5, \"E_BV\": 0},\n    }\n\n    observable_stars = []\n\n    print(\"Analyzing stars based on observability criteria:\")\n    print(f\"1.
