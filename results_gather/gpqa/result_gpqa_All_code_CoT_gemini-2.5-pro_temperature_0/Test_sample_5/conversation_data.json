    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Start with the given potential in polar coordinates, V(r, θ).\n2.  Convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformation equations: `x = r * cos(θ)` and `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`.\n3.  Simplify the potential in Cartesian coordinates. You will find that it separates into two independent terms, one depending only on x and the other only on y: `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`.\n4.  Recognize that this is the potential for a 2D anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The total energy `E` will be the sum of the energies of two independent 1D quantum harmonic oscillators, `E = E_x + E_y`.\n5.  For each direction (x and y), identify the effective spring constant (`k_x` and `k_y`) from the potential terms `V_x(x) = 1/2 * k_x * x^2` and `V_y(y) = 1/2 * k_y * y^2`.\n6.  Recall the energy spectrum for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator: `E_n = (n + 1/2) * ħ * ω`, where `ω = sqrt(k_effective / m)`.\n7.  Calculate the energies `E_x` and `E_y` using their respective quantum numbers (`n_x`, `n_y`) and angular frequencies (`ω_x`, `ω_y`).\n8.  Sum the energies `E_x` and `E_y` to find the total energy spectrum `E`.\n9.  Compare the resulting expression for `E` with the given options to determine the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_energy_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically derives the energy spectrum for the given potential\n    and prints the correct choice from the provided options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: The potential is given in polar coordinates.\n    # V(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\n    # Step 2: Convert to Cartesian coordinates.\n    # We use the relations: x = r*cos(θ) and r^2 = x^2 + y^2.\n    # Substituting these into the potential:\n    # V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (r*cos(θ))^2\n    # V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2\n\n    # Step 3: Simplify the Cartesian potential.\n    # V(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    # V(x, y) = (4/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    # V(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n    # Step 4 & 5: Identify the potential as two independent 1D harmonic oscillators.\n    # The potential is separable: V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y).\n    # The standard form is V_eff = 1/2 * k_eff * z^2.\n    # For the x-direction: V_x(x) = 1/2 * (4k) * x^2.
