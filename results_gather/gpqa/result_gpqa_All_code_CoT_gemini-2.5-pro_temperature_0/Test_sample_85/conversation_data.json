    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester). The only difference is the stereochemistry at carbon 4, which is the chiral center bearing the ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material Structure:** The proposed starting materials are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-C(=O)O-iBu) at the other. The chiral center is at carbon 3, which corresponds to carbon 4 in the final lactone product.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acid).\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally *not* strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The ester group in the starting material is reduced to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu --(LiBH₄)--> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n        3.  Upon addition of acid (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. So, A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acid).\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH₃ is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group in the starting material is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu --(BH₃)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n        3.  Upon addition of acid (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to reaction 1, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. So, B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n5.  **Final Match:**\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the reagents and their selectivity.\n# LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces esters to alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n# BH3 (Borane) selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols but is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1.\n# A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n# The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid monoester: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu.\n# LiBH4 reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 intact.\n# The intermediate is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH.\n# Acid workup (H+) causes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n# The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the product).\n# Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n# Since the product is (R), the starting material A must also be (R).\n# A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2.\n# B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n# The starting material B has the same structure type.\n# BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester at C5 intact.\n# The intermediate is a 5-hydroxy ester: HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu.\n# Acid workup (H+) causes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, eliminating isobutanol.\n# This reaction also does not affect the chiral center at C3.\n# Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n# Since the product is (S), the starting material B must also be (S).\n# B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n# Step 4: Combine the results and select the correct option.\n# A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n# B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n# This combination matches option C.\n\nfinal_choice = 'C'\n\nprint(f\"Based on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry, the correct starting materials are:\")\nprint(f\"A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\")\nprint(f\"B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option: {final_choice}\")\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```"
