    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the exponential decay of particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity. The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by `f = exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's proper lifetime (`τ₀`, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n3.  **Determine the Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is `t ≈ R / c`.\n4.  **Formulate the Core Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the decay formula, we get:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀)) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. So, `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n5.  **Use the Initial Condition:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `f₁ = 1/3`. We can use this to find the constant `K`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`.\n    This gives us `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`.\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the fraction of surviving particles is `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`.\n    Solving for `γ₂`: `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`.\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, substitute the value of `K` we found in step 5 into the equation from step 6.\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`.\n8.  **Code the Calculation:** Write a Python script to compute this value and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This problem can be solved by relating the fraction of particles reaching the detector\n# to the Lorentz factor and the particle's proper lifetime.\n\n# The fraction of particles 'f' that do not decay is given by f = exp(-t / τ_lab),\n# where t is the time in the lab frame and τ_lab is the dilated lifetime.\n# t = R / v ≈ R / c (since particles are ultra-relativistic)\n# τ_lab = γ * τ₀ (where γ is the Lorentz factor and τ₀ is the proper lifetime)\n# So, f = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))\n\n# Let's define a constant C = R / (c * τ₀).
