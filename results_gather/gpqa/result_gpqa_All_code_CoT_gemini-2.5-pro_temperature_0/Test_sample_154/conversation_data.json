    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ for the given state. The uncertainty of an operator $A$ is defined by the formula:\n$(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\nwhere $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator $A$ in the given state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Represent the operators and state vector:** We will define the matrix for the operator $P_z$ and the column vector for the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ using the `numpy` library. For simplicity in the calculation, we will set the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar = 1$ and reintroduce it in the final answer.\n2.  **Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:** The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$. In matrix notation, this is $\\psi^\\dagger P_z \\psi$, where $\\psi^\\dagger$ is the conjugate transpose of $\\psi$.\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:** First, we compute the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$ by squaring the matrix $P_z$. Then, we calculate its expectation value using the formula $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n4.  **Compute the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:** We will substitute the values of $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ into the uncertainty formula $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$.\n5.  **Determine the correct option:** Finally, we will compare our result (remembering to reintroduce $\\hbar$) with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the operator Pz and the state vector psi.\n# We set hbar = 1 for the calculation and will reintroduce it at the end.\nhbar = 1.0\n\n# The matrix for the operator P_z\nPz = hbar * np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -1]\n])\n\n# The state vector of the system, psi\npsi = np.array([\n    [-1/2],\n    [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n    [-1/2]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the expectation value of Pz, <Pz>.\n# First, get the conjugate transpose of psi (psi_dagger)\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\n\n# <Pz> = psi_dagger * Pz * psi\nexp_Pz = (psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the expectation value of Pz^2, <Pz^2>.\n# First, calculate the matrix for the operator Pz^2\nPz_squared = Pz @ Pz\n\n# <Pz^2> = psi_dagger * Pz^2 * psi\nexp_Pz_squared = (psi_dagger @ Pz_squared @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Step 4: Compute the uncertainty Delta Pz.\n# The variance is (Delta Pz)^2 = <Pz^2> - <Pz>^2\nvariance_Pz = exp_Pz_squared - exp_Pz**2\n\n# The uncertainty is the square root of the variance\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\n# The result is in units of hbar.\n# uncertainty_Pz / hbar = 1/sqrt(2)\n# So, Delta Pz = hbar / sqrt(2)\n\nprint(f\"The expectation value <Pz> is: {exp_Pz:.4f} * hbar\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value <Pz^2> is: {exp_Pz_squared:.4f} * hbar^2\")\nprint(f\"The variance (Delta Pz)^2 is: {variance_Pz:.4f} * hbar^2\")\nprint(f\"The uncertainty Delta Pz is: {uncertainty_Pz:.4f} * hbar\")\nprint(\"\\nThis result corresponds to hbar / sqrt(2).\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) sqrt(2)*hbar = {np.sqrt(2):.4f}*hbar\")\nprint(f\"B) hbar/2 = {1/2:.4f}*hbar\")\nprint(f\"C) hbar/sqrt(2) = {1/np.sqrt(2):.4f}*hbar\")\nprint(f\"D) hbar = {1.0:.4f}*hbar\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated uncertainty matches option C.\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
