    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific z-components of orbital angular momentum for two electrons in a given coupled state.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   The initial state is the coupled angular momentum state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. The key quantum number here is the total magnetic quantum number, `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired final state is determined by the measurement outcome. We want the eigenvalue of `L_1z` to be `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L_2z` to be `-ħ`. The eigenvalue of `L_z` is `m_q * ħ`, so this corresponds to measuring the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\n2.  **Apply the conservation principle:**\n    *   In quantum mechanics, the addition of angular momenta follows specific rules. The relationship between the coupled state `|l, m>` and the uncoupled states `|m1, m2>` is described by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the z-components of the angular momentum are conserved. This means the total magnetic quantum number `m` must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   So, we must have `m = m1 + m2` for the probability to be non-zero.\n\n3.  **Calculate and conclude:**\n    *   Check if the condition `m = m1 + m2` is met for this problem.\n    *   Initial state: `m = -1`.\n    *   Final state: `m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   Since `m ≠ m1 + m2` (`-1 ≠ -2`), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these states is zero.\n    *   The probability of a measurement is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient. Therefore, the probability is `0^2 = 0`.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   The Python code will define the quantum numbers `m`, `m1`, and `m2`.\n    *   It will then check if `m` is equal to `m1 + m2`.\n    *   Based on this check, it will determine the probability and select the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_angular_momentum_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the joint probability for measuring the z-components of angular momentum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers from the problem statement.\n    # The initial coupled state is |l, m> = |2, -1>.\n    # The total magnetic quantum number of the system is m.\n    m = -1\n\n    # The measurement is for the eigenvalues of L_1z and L_2z to both be -ħ.\n    # The eigenvalue of L_z is m_q * ħ, where m_q is the magnetic quantum number.\n    # So, we are measuring for m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.\n    m1_measured = -1\n    m2_measured = -1\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the selection rule for the addition of angular momentum.\n    # The probability is non-zero only if m = m1 + m2.
