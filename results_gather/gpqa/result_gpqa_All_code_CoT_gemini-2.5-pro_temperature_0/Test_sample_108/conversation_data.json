    "To solve this problem, we need to check which of the proposed decay channels violates the fundamental conservation laws and symmetry principles of nuclear physics. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State**: The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we get:\n        *   Total Spin `S_initial = 0` (since `2S+1=1`).\n        *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_initial = 0` (from the letter `S`).\n        *   Total Angular Momentum `J_initial = 0` (from the subscript `0`).\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Decay Process**: The decay is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system is `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws and Constraints**:\n    *   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**: `J_initial = J_final`. Since `J_initial = 0`, the final total angular momentum must also be 0. `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_NN_final`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the sum to be zero, we must have `J_NN_final = l_X`.\n    *   **Conservation of Parity (P)**: `P_initial = P_final`. The final parity is `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`. Since `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_NN_final` and `P(X) = -1`, we have `P_final = (-1)^L_NN_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`. For parity to be conserved (`+1 = P_final`), the exponent `L_NN_final + 1 + l_X` must be even. This means `L_NN_final + l_X` must be **odd**.\n    *   **Pauli Statistics for Final State**: The problem states that for the final NN state with `T(NN) = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_NN_final + L_NN_final + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that `S_NN_final + L_NN_final` must be **odd**.\n\n4.  **Check Each Option**: We will now write a Python script to apply these three rules to each of the given options. The script will also check for the physical validity of the proposed NN states (for two nucleons, total spin S can only be 0 or 1).\n\n```python\ndef solve_nuclear_decay_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four possible nuclear decay channels based on conservation laws\n    and Pauli statistics to find the one that is not permitted.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Mapping from spectroscopic notation to quantum numbers\n    L_map = {'S': 0, 'P': 1, 'D': 2, 'F': 3}\n    l_map = {'s': 0, 'p': 1, 'd': 2, 'f': 3}\n\n    # The decay options to be checked\n    options = {\n        'A': ('7D1', 'p'),\n        'B': ('3P0', 's'),\n        'C': ('3S1', 'p'),\n        'D': ('3D3', 'f'),\n    }\n\n    forbidden_choice = None\n\n    for choice, (nn_state, x_state) in options.items():\n        # --- Parse quantum numbers from the notation ---\n        multiplicity = int(nn_state[0])\n        L_char = nn_state[1]\n        J_NN = int(nn_state[2])\n\n        # S_NN is the total spin of the final two-nucleon system\n        S_NN = (multiplicity - 1) / 2\n        # L_NN is the orbital angular momentum of the final two-nucleon system\n        L_NN = L_map[L_char]\n        # l_X is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X\n        l_X = l_map[x_state]\n\n        # --- Apply the rules ---\n        # Rule 0: The final NN state must be physically possible (S=0 or S=1 for two nucleons)\n        is_physical = S_NN == 0 or S_NN == 1\n        \n        # Rule 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum (J_NN = l_X)\n        conserves_J = (J_NN == l_X)\n\n        # Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (L_NN + l_X must be odd)\n        conserves_P = ((L_NN + l_X) % 2 == 1)\n\n        # Rule 3: Pauli statistics for final NN state with T=0 (S_NN + L_NN must be odd)\n        obeys_pauli = ((S_NN + L_NN) % 2 == 1)\n\n        # A transition is permitted only if all rules are satisfied\n        is_permitted = is_physical and conserves_J and conserves_P and obeys_pauli\n\n        if not is_permitted:\n            forbidden_choice = choice\n            # In this problem, we expect only one forbidden choice among the plausible options.\n            # Option A involves an unphysical state (S=3), which is a fundamental issue.\n            # Option B involves a physical state but violates the Pauli rule for the reaction.\n            # In physics problems of this type, one typically assumes the states are typos if unphysical\n            # and focuses on the reaction dynamics.
