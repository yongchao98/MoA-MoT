    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reagents for the given chemical reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\nReaction 1: `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\nThis reaction is a nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to a ketone (butan-2-one), forming a cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves two main steps:\n1.  The nucleophilic cyanide ion from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n2.  This forms an alkoxide intermediate, which needs to be protonated by a proton source to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\nReagent A must therefore be a source of protons (H⁺). In chemical notation, an acidic aqueous solution is often represented as H₃O⁺. This eliminates options A and B, which suggest NaHSO₃.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\nReaction 2: `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, in the presence of water and heat.\n1.  The options remaining are C (B = CH₃COOH) and D (B = HCl).\n2.  CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid.\n3.  HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid.\nWhile a weak acid might slowly catalyze the reaction, the hydrolysis of nitriles is typically and most effectively carried out using a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄. Therefore, HCl is the more suitable reagent for this transformation.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the conclusions.**\nFrom Step 1, reagent A is H₃O⁺.\nFrom Step 2, reagent B is HCl.\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes two chemical reactions to determine the correct reagents\n    from a list of options and prints the final choice.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    # This is a cyanohydrin formation.
