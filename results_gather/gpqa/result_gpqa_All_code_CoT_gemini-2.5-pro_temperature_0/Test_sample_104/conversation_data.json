    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Star's Brightness:** I will use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T⁴). The star's total observed brightness (flux) is the sum of the radiation from all visible parts of its surface.\n2.  **Calculate Maximum and Minimum Flux:**\n    *   The maximum flux (F_max) occurs when the bright, unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n    *   The minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the hemisphere with dark spots is facing the observer. This flux will be a weighted average of the flux from the hot photosphere (`T_eff⁴`) and the cooler spots (`T_spot⁴`), based on the spot filling factor `f`.\n3.  **Determine the Light Curve Amplitude:** The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux: `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n4.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:** The drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet is approximately the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area, which simplifies to `(R_pl / R_star)²`.\n5.  **Equate and Solve:** I will set the brightness variation from the spots equal to the brightness drop from the hypothetical planet transit and solve for the radius ratio `R_pl / R_star`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\ndelta_T = 1000.0 # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20       # Filling factor of spots on the hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the temperature of the spots\nT_spot = T_eff - delta_T\n\n# The relative flux drop due to rotational modulation of spots is given by:\n# delta_F / F = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n# This formula represents the amplitude of the light curve.\nflux_drop_from_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The flux drop from a transiting exoplanet is given by:\n# delta_F / F = (R_planet / R_star)**2\n\n# To find the equivalent planet radius, we set the two flux drops equal:\n# (R_planet / R_star)**2 = flux_drop_from_spots\n# R_planet / R_star = sqrt(flux_drop_from_spots)\n\nRpl_over_Rstar = math.sqrt(flux_drop_from_spots)\n\n# Print the final result and the given options\nprint(f\"The calculated radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star (Rpl/Rstar) is: {Rpl_over_Rstar:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result to the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~0.39\")\nprint(f\"B) ~0.32\")\nprint(f\"C) ~0.07\")\nprint(f\"D) ~0.11\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option B.\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
