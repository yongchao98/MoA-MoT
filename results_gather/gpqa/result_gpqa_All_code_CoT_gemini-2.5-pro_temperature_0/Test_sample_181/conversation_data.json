    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Identify the correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n    *   **Equation Provided:** $J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\n    *   **Constraints:**\n        *   Provide the solution as Python code in a single code block.\n        *   Use the `print()` function for output.\n        *   Explain the plan/thinking process first.\n        *   The final answer must be in the format `<<<answer content>>>`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics of the Mott-Gurney Equation:**\n    *   The equation describes Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC). This is a fundamental concept in semiconductor device physics.\n    *   What are the key assumptions behind the SCLC model as described by Mott and Gurney?\n        *   **Carrier Injection:** The current is limited not by the bulk properties of the material (like in the Ohmic regime) but by the buildup of space charge from carriers *injected* from a contact. This requires a contact that can supply a large number of carriers, i.e., an **Ohmic contact** or a contact with **no injection barrier**. A Schottky contact, which is rectifying and limits injection, would not lead to this behavior.\n        *   **Carrier Type:** The standard Mott-Gurney equation considers only one type of mobile charge carrier (either electrons or holes). Therefore, it applies to a **single-carrier device**. Models for two-carrier (bipolar) devices are more complex.\n        *   **Traps:** The ideal Mott-Gurney law ($J \\propto V^2$) assumes the material is an ideal insulator or semiconductor with **no traps** in the bandgap. If traps are present, they capture some of the injected carriers, and the voltage dependence changes (often to a higher power, $J \\propto V^n$ where n > 2, in the trap-filled limit).\n        *   **Current Mechanism:** The model is derived by considering the drift of carriers under the influence of the electric field. The contribution from carrier diffusion (movement due to concentration gradients) is assumed to be **negligible**. This is a valid assumption when the applied voltage is sufficiently high.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option Based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   `trap-free`: Correct.\n        *   `single-carrier`: Correct.\n        *   `Ohmic contact`: Correct.\n        *   `negligible drift current`: **Incorrect**. The equation *describes* the drift current. It's the *diffusion* current that is neglected. This statement is fundamentally flawed.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   `trap-free`: Correct.\n        *   `single-carrier`: Correct.\n        *   `no carrier injection barrier`: Correct. This is the essential property of the contact needed for SCLC.\n        *   `negligible diffusion current`: **Correct**. This is a key assumption in the derivation.\n        *   This option appears to be entirely correct.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   `two-carrier device`: **Incorrect**. The standard Mott-Gurney law is for single-carrier transport.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   `Schottky contact`: **Incorrect**. A Schottky contact limits injection, which is contrary to the SCLC mechanism that requires a reservoir of charge at the contact.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Python Code:**\n    *   The code should present the problem clearly to the user.\n    *   I will create a list or dictionary of the options.\n    *   I will loop through the options and print them with their labels (A, B, C, D).\n    *   After presenting the options, I will print a separator and then state the correct answer based on my analysis (which is B).\n    *   The final line of the entire response will be `<<<B>>>`.\n\nThis structured approach ensures all conditions are checked against the physical model, leading to the correct choice, and then translates that choice into the required Python code format.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_mott_gurney_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation and identifies the correct statement.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    question = \"The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime.
