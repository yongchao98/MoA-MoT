    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to determine the functional relationship (pathway, epistasis, roles) between three genes (G1, G2, G3) based on the disease resistance levels of their knockout mutants.\n\n2.  **Organize the Data:** First, I'll list the provided data in a clear, structured way.\n    *   Wild-Type (Control): 100% resistance\n    *   g1 (G1 knockout): 75% resistance\n    *   g2 (G2 knockout): 0% resistance\n    *   g3 (G3 knockout): 50% resistance\n    *   g1g2 (double knockout): 0% resistance\n    *   g1g3 (double knockout): 10% resistance\n    *   g2g3 (double knockout): 0% resistance\n    *   Crucial fact: At least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) that acts *upstream* of another.\n\n3.  **Analyze for Epistasis:** Epistasis is when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. To find it, I'll compare the phenotype of a double mutant with the phenotypes of its corresponding single mutants.\n    *   **Interaction between G1 and G2:**\n        *   Phenotype of g1 = 75%\n        *   Phenotype of g2 = 0%\n        *   Phenotype of g1g2 = 0%\n        *   The phenotype of the double mutant `g1g2` (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the single mutant `g2` (0%). This is the classic definition of epistasis. It means the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation's effect. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. In a simple linear pathway, this places G2 downstream of G1.\n\n    *   **Interaction between G2 and G3:**\n        *   Phenotype of g2 = 0%\n        *   Phenotype of g3 = 50%\n        *   Phenotype of g2g3 = 0%\n        *   Similarly, the phenotype of the double mutant `g2g3` (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the single mutant `g2` (0%). This means the `g2` mutation also masks the `g3` mutation's effect. Therefore, **G2 is also epistatic to G3**. This places G2 downstream of G3 as well.\n\n4.  **Synthesize a Pathway Model:**\n    *   From the epistasis analysis, we know G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3. This suggests a pathway where G1 and G3 contribute to a process that requires G2 for the final output (resistance). The pathway could look like this: `(G1 and G3) --> G2 --> Resistance`.\n    *   The `g2` mutant has 0% resistance because the pathway is completely blocked at a critical, final step.\n    *   The problem states one gene is a TF acting *upstream*. Since G2 is the most downstream element, it cannot be the upstream TF for G1 or G3. This makes it highly likely that G1 and/or G3 are the upstream TFs that regulate the expression of G2 or other genes in the pathway.\n\n5.  **Analyze the G1 and G3 Interaction:**\n    *   Phenotype of g1 = 75%\n    *   Phenotype of g3 = 50%\n    *   Phenotype of g1g3 = 10%\n    *   The double mutant's resistance (10%) is much lower than either single mutant. This indicates that G1 and G3 are not in a simple linear pathway (like G1 -> G3). If they were, the `g1` mutant's phenotype would be the same as or more severe than the `g3` mutant's. Instead, they likely act in parallel or have partially redundant functions that converge. Knocking out both is far more detrimental than knocking out just one. This is sometimes referred to as a synthetic interaction or related to gene redundancy.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:** Now I will check each option against my conclusions.\n    *   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Plausible and consistent with our model where G1 is upstream.\n        *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: We cannot determine this from the data (pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits; we only measured one). However, this doesn't invalidate the other parts.\n        *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: **This is correct**, as determined in step 3.\n        *   This option contains a statement that is demonstrably true from the data.\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Unlikely, as it appears to be downstream.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: **This is false**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Unlikely.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **This is false**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Unlikely.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **This is false**.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** Option A is the only one that correctly identifies the epistatic relationship between G2 and G1, which is the strongest conclusion we can draw from the double-mutant data. The other claims in option A are either plausible (`G1 is a TF`) or untestable (`pleiotropy`), but it's the only option not contradicted by the data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_interaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes genetic data to determine the relationship between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n    \"\"\"\n    resistance_levels = {\n        \"g1\": 75,\n        \"g2\": 0,\n        \"g3\": 50,\n        \"g1g2\": 0,\n        \"g1g3\": 10,\n        \"g2g3\": 0,\n        \"wt\": 100\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the epistasis between G1 and G2.\")\n    phenotype_g1 = resistance_levels[\"g1\"]\n    phenotype_g2 = resistance_levels[\"g2\"]\n    phenotype_g1g2 = resistance_levels[\"g1g2\"]\n    print(f\"Phenotypes: g1={phenotype_g1}%, g2={phenotype_g2}%, g1g2={phenotype_g1g2}%\")\n    \n    g2_is_epistatic_to_g1 = (phenotype_g1g2 == phenotype_g2)\n    print(f\"The phenotype of the double mutant g1g2 ({phenotype_g1g2}%) is the same as the phenotype of the single mutant g2 ({phenotype_g2}%).\")\n    print(f\"Conclusion: G2 is epistatic to G1.
