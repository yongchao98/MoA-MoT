    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** First, we need to understand the structure of the starting material, \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\", and determine its key features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **cyclohex**: This indicates one ring structure (IHD = 1).\n    *   **-3-ene**: This indicates one carbon-carbon double bond within the ring (IHD = 1).\n    *   **vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH2 group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   **formyl**: This is a -CHO group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   **carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   The total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (ene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (acid) = 5.\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:** The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of HI. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the formyl group will be reduced, and the whole group becomes a methyl (-CH3).\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced, and the whole group becomes a methyl (-CH3).\n    *   Importantly, this reaction does *not* break the ring structure.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product and its IHD:** After the reaction, all the pi bonds (from C=C and C=O) are removed. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the original cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the IHD of the final product is 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate using Molecular Formula (for verification):**\n    *   **Reactant:** The molecular formula is C10H12O3. IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 5.\n    *   **Product:** The reaction removes all oxygen and saturates all pi bonds, without changing the number of carbons. The resulting product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C10H20.\n    *   **Product IHD Calculation:** Using the formula for the product (C10H20):\n        IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 20/2 = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe code below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the reactant.\n# The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n# Let's determine its molecular formula.\n# Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10\n# The reaction with red P and excess HI is a complete reduction.\n# It reduces all C=C and C=O bonds and removes oxygen atoms, but does not break the ring.\n# The number of carbon atoms in the product remains the same.\nnum_carbons_product = 10\n\n# Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n# The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cycloalkane).\n# The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is C_n H_{2n}.\n# For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\nnum_hydrogens_product = 2 * num_carbons_product\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product.\n# The formula for IHD is: C + 1 - (H/2)\n# where C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\nihd_product = num_carbons_product + 1 - (num_hydrogens_product / 2)\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and the corresponding choice.\nprint(\"The reaction involves the complete reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\")\nprint(\"The reactant has multiple double bonds (C=C and C=O) and a ring.\")\nprint(\"Red P and excess HI reduce all double bonds but do not open the ring.\")\nprint(f\"The number of carbon atoms in the product is {num_carbons_product}.\")\nprint(f\"The product is a saturated cycloalkane with the formula C{num_carbons_product}H{num_hydrogens_product}.\")\nprint(f\"The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: C + 1 - H/2\")\nprint(f\"IHD = {num_carbons_product} + 1 - ({num_hydrogens_product}/2) = {int(ihd_product)}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure remaining in the product.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 3\")\nprint(\"B) 1\")\nprint(\"C) 5\")\nprint(\"D) 0\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe correct choice is B, as the calculated IHD is {int(ihd_product)}.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
