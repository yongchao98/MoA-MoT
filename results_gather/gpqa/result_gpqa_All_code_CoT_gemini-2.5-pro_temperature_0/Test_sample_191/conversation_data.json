    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor to ensure the electric field within the conductor's material is zero. Therefore, a charge of `-q` is induced on the surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage effect):** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The combined electric field at any point outside the conductor due to the original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity's inner wall is zero.\n4.  **Field due to Outer Charge:** Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n5.  **Symmetry and Charge Distribution:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this outer surface.\n6.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from the point P. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other parameters given in the problem, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta`, are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols used in the problem\nk = sympy.Symbol(\"1/(4*pi*epsilon_o)\") # Coulomb's constant\nq = sympy.Symbol(\"q\") # Charge inside the cavity\nL = sympy.Symbol(\"L\") # Distance from the center of the conductor to point P\nl = sympy.Symbol(\"l\") # Distance from the center of the cavity to point P\ns = sympy.Symbol(\"s\") # Distance between centers\ntheta = sympy.Symbol(\"theta\") # Angle\n\n# Step-by-step reasoning\nprint(\"Step-by-step derivation of the electric field at point P:\")\nprint(\"1.
