    "Here is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, `L1 / L2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Governing Laws:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`. For a ratio, this simplifies to `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a star is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (`λ_emitted`). So, `T ∝ 1 / λ_emitted`. This means `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (`λ_observed`) is different from the *emitted* wavelength (`λ_emitted`) if the star is moving. The formula for redshift (moving away) is `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)`, where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Connect the Information:**\n    *   We are given the radius ratio: `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n    *   We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_observed_1 = λ_observed_2`.\n    *   Star 1 has zero velocity (`v1 = 0`), so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength: `λ_observed_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   Star 2 is moving away (`v2 = 700 km/s`), so its observed wavelength is redshifted: `λ_observed_2 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   By combining these, we find the relationship between the emitted wavelengths: `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   Now, we can find the temperature ratio: `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula: `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1 / (1 + v2/c))⁴`.\n    *   I will perform this calculation using Python to get a precise result and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and constants.\n# The ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2.\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# The radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s. Star_1's velocity is 0.\nv2_kms = 700\n# The speed of light in km/s.\nc_kms = 299792.458\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the temperature ratio (T1 / T2).\n# The problem states the observed peak wavelengths are the same (lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2).\n# For Star_1 (v=0), lambda_obs_1 = lambda_emitted_1.\n# For Star_2 (v>0), the light is redshifted: lambda_obs_2 = lambda_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c).\n# Therefore, lambda_emitted_1 = lambda_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c).\n# According to Wien's Law, Temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted wavelength (T ∝ 1/lambda_emitted).\n# So, T1 / T2 = lambda_emitted_2 / lambda_emitted_1.\n# Substituting the wavelength relation, we get: T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c).\ntemperature_ratio = 1 / (1 + v2_kms / c_kms)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the luminosity ratio (L1 / L2).\n# According to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, Luminosity is proportional to R^2 * T^4.\n# So, L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * (temperature_ratio**4)\n\n# Step 4: Print the final result and compare with the options.\nprint(f\"The calculated luminosity ratio (L1 / L2) is: {luminosity_ratio:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~2.25\")\nprint(\"B) ~2.35\")\nprint(\"C) ~2.23\")\nprint(\"D) ~2.32\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
