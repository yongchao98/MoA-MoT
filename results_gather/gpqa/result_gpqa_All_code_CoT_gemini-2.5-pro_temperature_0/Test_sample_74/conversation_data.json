  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the reason for the failed protein expression, I will analyze the provided DNA sequence. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Translate the DNA sequence**: I will translate the given DNA coding strand into its corresponding amino acid sequence using the standard genetic code. The translation will start from the beginning of the sequence.\n2.  **Identify anomalies**: I will carefully examine the translated sequence for any issues. Specifically, I will look for:\n    *   A premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA), which would halt translation.\n    *   Errors in the N-terminal HA tag sequence (`YPYDVPDYA`), which would indicate a missense mutation.\n3.  **Evaluate the options**: Based on the findings from the translation, I will determine which of the given options (A, B, C, or D) is the most accurate explanation for the experimental observation.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan. It will translate the sequence and stop when it encounters a stop codon, revealing the underlying problem.\n\n```python\ndef solve_protein_expression_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a DNA sequence to find the cause of failed protein expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The provided DNA sequence for the construct\n    dna_sequence = \"ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA\"\n\n    # Standard DNA codon table\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C',\n        'TGG':'W',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F',\n        'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_', 'TGA':'_STOP_'\n    }\n\n    protein_sequence = \"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Translating the provided DNA sequence codon by codon.\")\n    \n    # Iterate through the sequence by codons (3 bases at a time)\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_sequence), 3):\n        codon = dna_sequence[i:i+3]\n        if len(codon) == 3:\n            amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown codons\n            position = i // 3 + 1\n            print(f\"Codon #{position}: {codon} -> {amino_acid}\")\n            if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n                print(\"\\nStep 2: Anomaly identified.\")\n                print(f\"A premature stop codon ('{codon}') was found at codon position {position}.\")\n                break\n            protein_sequence += amino_acid\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Evaluating the options based on the analysis.\")\n    print(\"The translation process is halted very early, producing only a short peptide.\")\n    print(\"This is because a 'TGA' stop codon exists immediately after the sequence for the HA tag.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the ribosome terminates translation prematurely.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"The correct choice is A because the sequence contains a premature stop codon.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nChoices:\")\n    print(\"A) The ribosome terminated the translation early\")\n    print(\"B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse\")\n    print(\"C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain\")\n    print(\"D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n<<<A>>>\")\n\nsolve_protein_expression_problem()\n```"
