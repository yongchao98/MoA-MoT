    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles:** First, we need to determine the number of moles for each compound (KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O) by dividing their mass by their respective molar mass.\n2.  **Calculate Concentrations:** Next, we'll find the initial molar concentrations of the ions H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O). This is done by dividing the moles of each compound by the total volume of the solution in liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L).\n3.  **Determine Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**: The solution is a buffer system composed of the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-. The equilibrium for this system is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka2. We can rearrange the Ka2 expression to solve for the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]:\n    *   H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\n    *   Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4³⁻]**: The orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of HPO4²⁻, which is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka3. We can rearrange the Ka3 expression to solve for [PO4³⁻]. We will use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4²⁻] (since its dissociation is minimal).\n    *   HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\n    *   Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: Finally, we will compare the calculated concentration of [PO4³⁻] with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\n\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\n\nvolume_cm3 = 200.00  # cm3\nvolume_L = volume_cm3 / 1000.0  # Convert cm3 to L\n\n# Dissociation constants for H3PO4\nKa1 = 7.5e-3\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate moles ---\nmoles_kh2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n# KH2PO4 provides H2PO4- ions\nmoles_h2po4 = moles_kh2po4\n\nmoles_na2hpo4_2h2o = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n# Na2HPO4 provides HPO4^2- ions\nmoles_hpo4 = moles_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations ---\nconc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\nconc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate hydrogen ion concentration [H+] ---\n# Using the buffer equilibrium: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_h_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] ---\n# Using the equilibrium: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n# We assume [HPO4^2-] at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration\n# because Ka3 is very small.\nconc_po4 = (Ka3 * conc_hpo4) / conc_h_plus\n\n# --- Step 5: Print the result and options ---\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is: {conc_po4:.3e} M\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 6.24x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 2.81x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 5.48x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 3.97x10^-7 M\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\")\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
