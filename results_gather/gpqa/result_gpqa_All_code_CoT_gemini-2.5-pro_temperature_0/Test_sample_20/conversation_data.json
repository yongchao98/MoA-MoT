    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Task:** Identify two specific compounds from a given list based on their chemical properties.\n    *   **Property 1 (Compound A):** Must *not* show tautomerism. The candidates are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n    *   **Property 2 (Compound B):** Must show optical isomerism. The candidates are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n    *   **Output:** Select the correct option (A, B, C, or D) that correctly identifies both compounds A and B. The final answer should be presented in a Python code block that prints the result.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers (tautomers) can readily interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Key Requirement for Keto-Enol Tautomerism:** The molecule must possess an \"alpha-hydrogen\" – a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n    *   **Candidate 1: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.** Its structure is a 6-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. These are sp³ hybridized carbons, and they are alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. They have alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic and very stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Candidate 2: Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone).** Its structure is a 6-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). While they have hydrogen atoms, these are not the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for simple keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding \"enol\" (hydroquinone) is a reduction (a redox reaction), not a simple isomerization (tautomerism). Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Definition:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Key Requirement:** The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Candidate 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon (carbon-2). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n    *   **Candidate 2: Dimethyl fumarate.** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It has a center of symmetry and is achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) = benzoquinone\n    *   Compound B (optical isomerism) = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   Matching this pair with the given options:\n        *   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  <- This is a match.\n        *   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n        *   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    *   The correct option is A.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   The code will programmatically determine the correct choice based on the conclusions from the analysis.\n    *   It will define the correct compound for each property.\n    *   It will then check the list of options to find the one that matches the correct compounds for both A and B.\n    *   Finally, it will print the letter of the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the isomerism problem by identifying the correct compounds\n    for properties A and B and then selecting the corresponding multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part A: Identify the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n    # - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens on sp3 carbons and readily tautomerizes to the stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n    # - Benzoquinone's conversion to hydroquinone is a redox reaction, not tautomerism. It lacks the typical sp3 alpha-carbons for keto-enol tautomerism.\n    # Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.\n    compound_A = \"benzoquinone\"\n\n    # Part B: Identify the compound that shows optical isomerism.\n    # - Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon with four different groups).\n    # - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a central carbon bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3.
