    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels:** The problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). The total energy of the molecule in a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n    `E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration, and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Determine the Transition:**\n    *   The molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   The absorption of a photon causes a transition to a higher energy state. For rovibrational transitions in a diatomic molecule, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = +1`.\n    *   Therefore, the transition from the ground state (`v=0, J=0`) to the next state with the lowest possible energy *reachable by photon absorption* is to the state `v = 1`, `J = 1`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon:** The energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must equal the energy difference (`ΔE`) between the final and initial states.\n    *   `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(1/2)`\n    *   `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(3/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = ħω(3/2) + ħ²/I`\n    *   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = (ħω(3/2) + ħ²/I) - ħω(1/2) = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n4.  **Calculate Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):** `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`. We need to convert the masses from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg).\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):** `I = μ * R²`. We need to convert the bond length `R` from angstroms to meters.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum:** The energy of a photon is related to its momentum (`p`) and the speed of light (`c`) by the equation `E_photon = p * c`. Therefore, the momentum is:\n    `p = E_photon / c = ΔE / c`\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations using the given values and physical constants. The script will compute the final momentum and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants ---\n# Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\nh_bar = 1.05457e-34\n# Speed of light (m/s)\nc = 3.0e8\n# Atomic mass unit to kg conversion\namu_to_kg = 1.66054e-27\n\n# --- Given Parameters ---\n# Mass of atom X (amu)\nMx_amu = 20\n# Mass of atom Y (amu)\nMy_amu = 2\n# Molecular bond length (angstroms)\nR_angstrom = 2\n# Angular frequency of vibration (rad/s)\nomega = 4.0e14\n\n# --- Step 1: Convert units to SI ---\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR_m = R_angstrom * 1e-10\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate Reduced Mass (mu) ---\nmu = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate Moment of Inertia (I) ---\nI = mu * R_m**2\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) for the transition ---\n# The transition is from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited\n# rovibrational state allowed by selection rules (v=1, J=1).\n# Delta E = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = (h_bar * omega) + (h_bar**2 / I)\nE_vib_term = h_bar * omega\nE_rot_term = (h_bar**2) / I\ndelta_E = E_vib_term + E_rot_term\n\n# --- Step 5: Calculate the photon's momentum (p) ---\n# p = Delta E / c\np = delta_E / c\n\n# --- Output the results ---\nprint(f\"Calculations:\")\nprint(f\"Reduced Mass (mu): {mu:.4e} kg\")\nprint(f\"Moment of Inertia (I): {I:.4e} kg*m^2\")\nprint(f\"Energy of Transition (Delta E): {delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Photon Momentum (p): {p:.4e} N*s\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# --- Compare with options ---\nprint(\"Comparing with the given options:\")\noptions = {\n    'A': 1.9e-28,\n    'B': 1.4e-28,\n    'C': 1.1e-27,\n    'D': 2.3e-27\n}\n\n# Find the closest option\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - p))\n\nprint(f\"A) p = {options['A']:.1e} N*s\")\nprint(f\"B) p = {options['B']:.1e} N*s\")\nprint(f\"C) p = {options['C']:.1e} N*s\")\nprint(f\"D) p = {options['D']:.1e} N*s\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\nprint(f\"The calculated momentum {p:.2e} N*s is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```"
