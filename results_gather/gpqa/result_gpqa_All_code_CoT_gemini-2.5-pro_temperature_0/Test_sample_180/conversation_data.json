    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:** First, we need to understand which solar neutrino sources contribute to the two specified energy bands: band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV).\n    *   **pp-chain neutrinos:**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos: Energy is too low (< 420 keV).\n        *   `7Be` neutrinos (from pp-II branch): Have a very strong, sharp energy line at 862 keV. This falls directly into **band 2**.\n        *   `8B` neutrinos (from pp-III branch): Have a continuous energy spectrum that extends to ~15 MeV. They contribute to **both band 1 and band 2**.\n    *   **CNO-cycle neutrinos:** Have continuous energy spectra (`13N`, `15O`) that also contribute to **both band 1 and band 2**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Hypothetical Change:** The problem states that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, this means we on Earth are just now observing the consequences. The pp-III branch is the source of `8B` neutrinos. Therefore, the flux from `8B` neutrinos becomes zero. The pp-II branch, which produces the `7Be` neutrinos, is unaffected.\n\n3.  **Analyze the New State (after the change):**\n    *   **Flux in band 1 (700-800 keV):** The only remaining contributors are the CNO-cycle neutrinos.\n    *   **Flux in band 2 (800-900 keV):** The contributors are the very strong `7Be` line and the CNO-cycle neutrinos.\n\n4.  **Estimate the Fluxes and Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   The flux in band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the `7Be` line. The contribution from the continuous CNO spectrum in this narrow band is negligible in comparison. So, we can approximate `Flux(band 2) ≈ Total Flux of 7Be neutrinos`. The established value for this is approximately 5.0 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n    *   The flux in band 1 consists of a small slice (100 keV wide) of the CNO neutrino spectrum. The total flux from the CNO cycle is about 7.0 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s, spread over an energy range of roughly 1.5 MeV. A reasonable approximation for the flux in a 100 keV (or 0.1 MeV) window is about one-tenth of the total CNO flux. So, `Flux(band 1) ≈ 0.1 * (Total CNO Flux) ≈ 0.1 * 7.0 x 10⁸ = 7.0 x 10⁷` neutrinos/cm²/s.\n    *   Now, we can calculate the ratio:\n        Ratio = `Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2)` ≈ `(7.0 x 10⁷) / (5.0 x 10⁹)` = `0.014`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio of approximately 0.014 is closest to the option 0.01.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neutrino_flux_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the approximate ratio of solar neutrino flux in two energy bands\n    under the hypothetical scenario that the pp-III branch has stopped.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the known total fluxes for the relevant neutrino sources.\n    # Fluxes are in units of neutrinos per cm^2 per second.\n    # Data is based on the Standard Solar Model and experimental results (e.g., from Borexino).\n    \n    # The 7Be neutrino line is from the pp-II branch and is unaffected.\n    # Its energy is 862 keV, placing it squarely in band 2 (800-900 keV).\n    flux_7Be_total = 5.0e9  # Approx. 5.0 x 10^9\n\n    # The CNO cycle neutrinos have a continuous spectrum.\n    # The total flux is the sum of fluxes from 13N, 15O, etc.\n    flux_CNO_total = 7.0e8  # Approx. 7.0 x 10^8\n\n    # The 8B neutrinos from the pp-III branch have stopped.
