    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the nucleus and its components:** The nucleus is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium's atomic number is 3, so it has 3 protons. The total number of nucleons is 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n2.  **Calculate the rest mass energy ($E_0$):** The rest mass of the nucleus can be approximated by summing the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. We will use the standard values for the rest mass of a proton (938.272 MeV/c²) and a neutron (939.565 MeV/c²). The rest energy $E_0$ in MeV is numerically equal to this mass in MeV/c². This approach is a common simplification that ignores the nuclear binding energy.\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):** The problem states the nucleus travels at a speed of $v = 0.96c$. The Lorentz factor, which describes the relativistic effects, is calculated using the formula $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n4.  **Calculate the total relativistic energy (E):** The total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest mass energy, given by the formula $E = \\gamma E_0$.\n5.  **Convert to GeV and select the answer:** The calculated energy will be in units of MeV (Mega-electron Volts). We will convert it to GeV (Giga-electron Volts) by dividing by 1000. Finally, we will compare this result to the given options to find the closest match.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_relativistic_energy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total relativistic energy of a Lithium-6 nucleus\n    traveling at 0.96c.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define constants and nucleus composition ---\n    # Rest mass of a proton in MeV/c^2\n    m_p_mev = 938.272\n    # Rest mass of a neutron in MeV/c^2\n    m_n_mev = 939.565\n    # Speed of the nucleus as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\n    v_over_c = 0.96\n    # Composition of the Lithium nucleus\n    num_protons = 3\n    num_neutrons = 3\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the rest mass energy (E0) in MeV ---\n    # The rest mass is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons.\n    # The rest energy E0 in MeV is numerically equal to the mass in MeV/c^2.\n    E0_mev = (num_protons * m_p_mev) + (num_neutrons * m_n_mev)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) ---\n    gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n    # --- Step 4: Calculate the total relativistic energy (E) in MeV ---\n    E_mev = gamma * E0_mev\n\n    # --- Step 5: Convert the energy to GeV ---\n    E_gev = E_mev / 1000\n\n    # --- Output the results and compare with options ---\n    print(f\"The calculated total energy of the nucleus is {E_gev:.4f} GeV.\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing with the given options:\")\n    print(\"A) 20.132 GeV\")\n    print(\"B) 23.069 GeV\")\n    print(\"C) 18.475 GeV\")\n    print(\"D) 21.419 GeV\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\")\n\n# Execute the calculation and print the results\ncalculate_relativistic_energy()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
