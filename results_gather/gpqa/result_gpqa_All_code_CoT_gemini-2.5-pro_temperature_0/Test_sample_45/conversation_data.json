    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:** The reactant is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. \"Racemic\" means it's a 50/50 mixture of its two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The reaction is an olefin metathesis reaction catalyzed by Grubbs catalyst. Since there is only one type of alkene, it will be a self-metathesis.\n\n2.  **Determine the General Product Structure:** The self-metathesis of a terminal alkene (R-CH=CH₂) produces a symmetrical internal alkene (R-CH=CH-R) and ethene (CH₂=CH₂). The question asks us to ignore ethene. For 3-methylpent-1-ene, the 'R' group is the chiral sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. The product is therefore 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry:** The product, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers (at carbons 3 and 6) and a double bond in the center (at carbon 4) which can have E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry.\n\n4.  **Consider All Possible Reaction Pairings:** Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers, there are three possible pairings for the two molecules that react:\n    *   **Pairing 1: (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene:** This reaction forms a product where both chiral centers have the (R) configuration: (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This can exist as two geometric isomers (diastereomers): the E isomer and the Z isomer. This gives **2 products**.\n    *   **Pairing 2: (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This reaction forms a product where both chiral centers have the (S) configuration: (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. These are the enantiomers of the products from Pairing 1. This also exists as two geometric isomers: the E isomer and the Z isomer. This gives **2 more distinct products**.\n    *   **Pairing 3: (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This \"cross-reaction\" forms a product with one (R) and one (S) chiral center: (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Because the two halves of the molecule are identical, this is a meso compound. This meso compound can also exist as two geometric isomers (diastereomers): the E isomer and the Z isomer. This gives **2 more distinct products**.\n\n5.  **Sum the Products:** By adding the products from all possible pairings, we get a total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 possible stereoisomeric products.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the reactant and reaction.\n# Reactant: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, a 50/50 mix of (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n# Reaction: Self-metathesis using Grubbs catalyst.\n# General form: 2 R-CH=CH2 -> R-CH=CH-R + ethene.\n\n# Step 2: Identify the product structure (excluding ethene).\n# The 'R' group is the chiral sec-butyl group from 3-methylpent-1-ene.\n# The product is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry of the product.\n# The product has two chiral centers (C3 and C6) and one C=C double bond (C4) that can be E or Z.\n\n# Step 4: Consider the three possible reaction pairings from the racemic mixture.\n# Let R_alkene = (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and S_alkene = (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\n# Pairing 1: R_alkene + R_alkene\n# This forms (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n# This can exist as two geometric isomers (diastereomers):\n# 1.
