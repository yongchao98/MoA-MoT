    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 with the specified absolute configurations.\n    *   The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regiochemistry:**\n    *   The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide is across C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n    *   The attack breaks the C6-O bond, and the oxygen (attached to C1) is later protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Constitution of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction adds a methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The starting molecule has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The product will have an -OH and a -CH₃ on the original C1. It will have a new -CH₃ on the original C6. It will retain the original -CH₃ groups at C3 and C4.\n    *   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. To name it via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are at the new C1, new C2 (old C6), new C4 (old C4), and new C5 (old C3). The locants are 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The product is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and B, which are constitutional isomers resulting from attack at the wrong carbon.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C6).\n    *   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) **retain their absolute configuration**.\n    *   Let's map the stereocenters from the reactant to the product:\n        *   Reactant C1 (R) → Product C1 (R)\n        *   Reactant C3 (R) → Product C5 (R)\n        *   Reactant C4 (R) → Product C4 (R)\n        *   Reactant C6 (S) → Product C2 (inverted configuration)\n    *   So, the product must have the configuration (1R, 4R, 5R). This is consistent with both options C and D.\n    *   The final step is to determine the configuration at C2, which results from the inversion of C6(S). While the geometric configuration is inverted, the R/S descriptor might not flip from S to R because the priorities of the substituents change. We must analyze this carefully.\n        *   Priorities at reactant C6: O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The configuration is (S).\n        *   Priorities at product C2: C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n        *   The Sₙ2 reaction causes a Walden inversion, meaning the spatial arrangement of the three non-reacting groups (H, C1, C5) is inverted relative to the central carbon.\n        *   Let's analyze the consequence for the R/S descriptor. A detailed analysis shows that when the leaving group (O, priority 1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, priority 3), and the other priorities shift, the descriptor for the inverted center remains (S).\n        *   Therefore, C6(S) becomes C2(S) after the reaction.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The product has the absolute configuration (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   This corresponds to the name (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the product of a chemical reaction.\n# Based on the step-by-step analysis:\n# 1.
