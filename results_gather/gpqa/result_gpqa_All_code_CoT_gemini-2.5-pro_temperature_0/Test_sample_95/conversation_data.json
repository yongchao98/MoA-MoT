    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Unit Conversion**: First, we need to convert the given values into standard SI units. The distance `d` is given in parsecs and needs to be converted to meters. The angular size `θ` is in degrees and must be converted to radians for use in trigonometric formulas.\n2.  **Calculate the Schwarzschild Radius (R_s)**: The angular size `θ` relates the diameter of the event horizon (`D = 2 * R_s`) to the distance `d` by the small-angle formula: `θ (in radians) ≈ D / d`. We can rearrange this to solve for the Schwarzschild radius: `R_s = (θ * d) / 2`.\n3.  **Calculate the Entropy (S)**: The entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, `S = (k_B * A) / (4 * L_p^2)`, where `A` is the area of the event horizon and `L_p` is the Planck length. A more direct formula using fundamental constants is `S = (k_B * π * c^3 * R_s^2) / (G * ħ)`, where:\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n4.  **Determine the Order of Magnitude**: After calculating the value of `S`, we will find its order of magnitude and compare it to the given options to select the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define physical constants and given values in SI units.\nG = 6.674e-11  # Gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nc = 3.0e8       # Speed of light (m/s)\nk_B = 1.38e-23  # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\nhbar = 1.054e-34 # Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\n\n# Conversion factors\nparsec_to_m = 3.086e16 # Meters per parsec\ndeg_to_rad = math.pi / 180.0 # Radians per degree\n\n# Given values from the problem\nd_parsecs = 10**10\ntheta_deg = 10**-17\n\n# Convert distance to meters and angle to radians\nd_m = d_parsecs * parsec_to_m\ntheta_rad = theta_deg * deg_to_rad\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (R_s)\n# The small-angle formula is θ ≈ D/d, where D is the diameter (2 * R_s).\n# So, R_s = (θ_rad * d_m) / 2\nR_s = (theta_rad * d_m) / 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S)\n# S = (k_B * π * c^3 * R_s^2) / (G * ħ)\nentropy = (k_B * math.pi * (c**3) * (R_s**2)) / (G * hbar)\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and determine the correct option.\nprint(f\"The calculated entropy of the black hole is approximately {entropy:.2e} J/K.\")\nprint(\"\\nLet's check the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 10^62 J/K\")\nprint(\"B) 10^65 J/K\")\nprint(\"C) 10^59 J/K\")\nprint(\"D) 10^66 J/K\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated order of magnitude is 10^62, which matches option A.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
