    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by the formula `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2*a)) * (1 - Albedo)^(1/4)`, where `T_star` and `R_star` are the star's temperature and radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `Albedo` is the planet's albedo. When we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`), the terms for the star's properties and the albedo (which is the same for both planets) cancel out, leaving us with: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n\n2.  **Relating Doppler Shift to Orbital Parameters:** The maximum Doppler shift (`Δλ`) is proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (`K`), given by `K = c * Δλ / λ_0`. Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocities is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts: `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and semi-major axis (`a`) by the formula `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. (We assume an inclination `i` of 90 degrees, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`, which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were detected via the transit method).\n    By rearranging this formula to solve for `a`, we find that `a` is proportional to `(M_p / K)^2`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)^2 / (M_p1 / K1)^2`, which simplifies to `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** By substituting `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2` into the equation from step 3, we get `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`.\n    Now, we substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from step 1:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2)`\n    This simplifies to the final formula: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the given masses and Doppler shifts, calculate the ratios, and then compute the final temperature ratio using the derived formula.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values for the planets\n# Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) can be derived as:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\n# This is because T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a) and a is proportional to (M_p / K)^2,\n# where K (radial velocity) is proportional to delta_lambda.\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Calculate the Doppler shift ratio (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Calculate the final equilibrium temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\n# Print the final calculated ratio and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet1/Planet2) is: {temp_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nWhich of the following options is the closest?\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ 0.98\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ 1.30\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ 1.05\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ 0.53\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
