    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the core concept:** I will first break down the meaning of the \"impulse approximation\" in the context of nuclear physics. The key idea is treating a bound nucleon as if it were a free particle for the brief moment of an interaction.\n2.  **Evaluate each assumption:** I will examine each of the four statements to see how it aligns with this core concept.\n    *   **Statement 1:** \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\" This addresses whether the interaction is a one-body or many-body phenomenon.\n    *   **Statement 2:** \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\" This deals with the initial and final state interactionsâ€”whether the probe and the ejected particles are affected by the other nucleons.\n    *   **Statement 3:** \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\" This concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, a different level of description.\n    *   **Statement 4:** \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\" This directly addresses how the nucleon's state (bound vs. free) is treated during the interaction.\n3.  **Synthesize the results:** I will combine the essential assumptions that collectively define the impulse approximation.\n4.  **Select the correct option:** I will match the set of essential assumptions to one of the given choices (A, B, C, or D).\n5.  **Generate the Python code:** I will write a Python script that prints the reasoning and the final selected option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_impulse_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the set of assumptions that define the impulse approximation in nuclear physics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The \"impulse approximation\" simplifies a complex many-body nuclear interaction.\n    # It is valid for high-energy scattering where the interaction time is very short\n    # compared to the characteristic time of nucleon motion within the nucleus.\n    # The core idea is to treat the interaction as a rapid \"impulse\" on a single,\n    # quasi-free nucleon.\n\n    # Let's analyze the assumptions:\n    # 1. \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"\n    #    - This is a fundamental part of the approximation. It assumes the probe interacts\n    #      with a single nucleon, ignoring more complex interactions involving multiple\n    #      nucleons at once (like meson-exchange currents). This is ESSENTIAL.\n\n    # 2. \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"\n    #    - This assumption, often part of the \"Plane Wave Impulse Approximation\" (PWIA),\n    #      states that the incoming probe and outgoing particles do not interact with the\n    #      other \"spectator\" nucleons. This ensures the event is a clean one-on-one\n    #      collision, just as it would be with a free nucleon. This is ESSENTIAL.\n\n    # 3. \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"\n    #    - This statement is about the internal structure of the nucleon itself (QCD),\n    #      not its behavior within the nuclear medium. The impulse approximation treats\n    #      the nucleon as the fundamental entity, regardless of its internal quark dynamics.\n    #      This is NOT an assumption of the impulse approximation.\n\n    # 4. \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"\n    #    - This is the very definition of treating the nucleon as \"free\". During the short\n    #      interaction, the binding potential holding the nucleon in the nucleus is ignored.\n    #      The nucleon is considered to be \"off-shell\" but interacts as a free particle.\n    #      This is ESSENTIAL.\n\n    # Conclusion: The essential assumptions are 1, 2, and 4.\n    # We now find the option that matches this set.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": [1, 2, 3],\n        \"B\": [1, 2, 4],\n        \"C\": [2, 3, 4],\n        \"D\": [1, 3, 4]\n    }\n    correct_assumptions = {1, 2, 4}\n    \n    final_choice = None\n    for choice, assumptions in options.items():\n        if set(assumptions) == correct_assumptions:\n            final_choice = choice\n            break\n\n    print(\"The assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:\")\n    print(\"1.
