    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision (the sum of the energies of the electron and positron) must equal the total energy after the collision (the sum of the energies of the two photons). The energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light. The energy of a photon is `E_ph`.\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. This is a vector quantity, so we must consider the components along the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes.\n    *   The momentum of a particle is given by `p = sqrt(γ² - 1) * mc`.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is `p_ph = E_ph / c`.\n3.  **Set up the Equations:**\n    *   From energy conservation, we can find the energy of each photon (`E_ph`), since they are equal.\n    *   From momentum conservation in the y-direction, we can confirm that the photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis, which is given in the problem.\n    *   From momentum conservation in the x-direction, we can establish a relationship involving the angle `θ` that each photon makes with the horizontal axis.\n4.  **Solve for the Angle:** By combining the equations from energy and momentum conservation, we can derive a formula for `cos(θ)`. The final angle between the two photons will be `2θ`.\n5.  **Calculate the Value:** We will use Python to perform the numerical calculation, find the angle `2θ` in degrees, and select the closest answer from the given options.\n\nThe derived equation for the cosine of half the angle (`θ`) is:\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(γ_e² - 1) - sqrt(γ_p² - 1)) / (γ_e + γ_p)`\nwhere `γ_e` and `γ_p` are the Lorentz factors of the electron and positron, respectively.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_annihilation_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the angle between two photons produced from an electron-positron annihilation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given Lorentz factors\n    gamma_e = 4  # for the electron\n    gamma_p = 2  # for the positron\n\n    # The problem asks for the angle between the two photons.\n    # Let theta be the angle of each photon with the horizontal axis.\n    # The total angle is 2 * theta.\n    # From conservation of energy and momentum, we can derive the formula for cos(theta):\n    # cos(theta) = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) / (gamma_e + gamma_p)\n\n    # Calculate the numerator and denominator\n    numerator = math.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1) - math.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1)\n    denominator = gamma_e + gamma_p\n\n    # Calculate cos(theta)\n    cos_theta = numerator / denominator\n\n    # Calculate theta in radians using the arccosine function\n    theta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n    # Convert theta from radians to degrees\n    theta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n    # The angle between the two photons is 2 * theta\n    total_angle = 2 * theta_deg\n\n    # Print the results and the final choice\n    print(f\"The Lorentz factor of the electron is: {gamma_e}\")\n    print(f\"The Lorentz factor of the positron is: {gamma_p}\")\n    print(f\"The angle of one photon with the horizontal axis is: {theta_deg:.2f} degrees\")\n    print(f\"The total angle between the two photons is: {total_angle:.2f} degrees\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\n    print(\"A) 96\")\n    print(\"B) 172\")\n    print(\"C) 138\")\n    print(\"D) 74\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to 138.\")\n\nsolve_annihilation_angle()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
