    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (pion, $\\pi^+$) into two other particles (muon, $\\mu^+$ and a neutrino, $\\nu$). This process must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the particles involved are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu}$ (where p is the magnitude of momentum).\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$). The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).\n    *   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino, we assume its rest mass is zero ($m_{\\nu} = 0$), so its energy is simply $E_{\\nu} = p_{\\nu}c$. The kinetic energy of a massless particle is its total energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu}$.\n\n4.  **Solve for Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   From momentum conservation and the neutrino's energy, we have $p_{\\mu}c = p_{\\nu}c = E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Substitute this into the energy conservation equation:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(KE_{\\nu})^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + KE_{\\nu}$\n    *   Rearranging and squaring this equation allows us to solve for the neutrino's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\nu}$):\n        $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n    *   Once we find $KE_{\\nu}$, we can find the muon's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\mu}$) using the total kinetic energy released in the decay (the Q-value):\n        $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n        $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$\n\n5.  **Python Implementation:** The following Python code will perform these calculations using the given rest mass values.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of Pi(+) in MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of mu(+) in MeV\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# Formula: KE_nu = (m_pi_c2^2 - m_mu_c2^2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n# Q = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE_mu = Q - KE_nu\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"B) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"C) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\")\n\n# Determine the correct option\nif abs(ke_mu - 4.12) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 29.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"A\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 3.52) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 20.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"B\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 7.2) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 32.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"C\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 2.84) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 26.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"D\"\nelse:\n    correct_option = \"None of the above\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated values match option {correct_option}.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
