    "To solve this problem, we will use the method of images, a powerful technique in electrostatics for problems involving charges and conductors.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). Since the sphere is a conductor, the charge `q` will induce an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere. The sphere being \"grounded\" means its potential is held at zero.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** To find the potential and field outside the sphere, we can replace the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must create a potential of zero on the surface that was once the sphere (at radius `r=R`).\n\n3.  **Image Charge and Position:** For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculating Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere. The potential energy `U` is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charge on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (the source of the potential) is itself created by the presence of `q`.\n\n5.  **Potential from Image Charge:** The potential `V_induced` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`. The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n6.  **Substitution and Simplification:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    *   `V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Final Energy Calculation:** Finally, we calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option C. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\nThe following Python code will select and print the correct choice from the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_potential_energy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct formula for the potential energy of a charge\n    near a grounded conducting sphere and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system with a charge q\n    # at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R.\n\n    # Based on the method of images in electrostatics, the potential energy U is derived as:\n    # U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)\n    # where k is Coulomb's constant.\n\n    # Let's define the given options.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\",\n        \"B\": \"U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\",\n        \"C\": \"U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\",\n        \"D\": \"U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\"\n    }\n\n    # The derived correct formula corresponds to option C.\n    correct_choice_key = \"C\"\n    correct_choice_formula = options[correct_choice_key]\n\n    # Print the final answer.\n    print(f\"The correct option is: {correct_choice_key}\")\n    print(f\"The formula for the net potential energy is: {correct_choice_formula}\")\n\nsolve_potential_energy_problem()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
