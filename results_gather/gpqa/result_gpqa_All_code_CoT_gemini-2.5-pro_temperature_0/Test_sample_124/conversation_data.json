    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the System:** The problem describes a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, a standard system in quantum mechanics.\n2.  **Recall the Energy Formula:** The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula `E_n = (n + 3/2) * ħ * ω`, where `n` is the principal quantum number (`n = 0, 1, 2, ...`), `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, and `ω` is the angular frequency.\n3.  **Determine the Quantum Number `n`:** The ground state corresponds to `n=0`. Therefore, the first excited state is `n=1`, the second is `n=2`, and the third excited state corresponds to `n=3`.\n4.  **Calculate the Energy:** Substitute `n=3` into the energy formula to find the energy of the third excited state.\n    `E_3 = (3 + 3/2) * ħ * ω = (9/2) * ħ * ω`.\n5.  **Recall the Degeneracy Formula:** The degeneracy `g_n` (the number of linearly independent states with the same energy `E_n`) for the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula `g_n = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2`.\n6.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** Substitute `n=3` into the degeneracy formula.\n    `g_3 = (3 + 1) * (3 + 2) / 2 = (4 * 5) / 2 = 10`.\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated energy is `(9/2) * ħ * ω` and the degeneracy is 10. This matches option D.\n8.  **Write Python Code:** Create a Python script to perform these calculations for `n=3` and print the results.\n\n```python\n# Define the principal quantum number for the third excited state.\n# The ground state is n=0, so the third excited state corresponds to n=3.\nn = 3\n\n# Calculate the numerical factor for the energy eigenvalue.\n# The formula is E_n = (n + 3/2) * hbar * omega.\n# We calculate the fraction (n + 3/2).\nenergy_numerator = 2 * n + 3\nenergy_denominator = 2\n\n# Calculate the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions).\n# The formula for degeneracy is g_n = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2.\ndegeneracy = (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 2\n\n# Print the results to match the format of the options.\n# The energy is expressed as a fraction times hbar*omega.\nprint(f\"The value of energy of the third excited state is ({energy_numerator}/{energy_denominator}) * hbar * omega.\")\nprint(f\"The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy is {degeneracy}.\")\n\n# Based on the output, we can select the correct option.\n# Energy: (9/2) * hbar * omega\n# Degeneracy: 10\n# This corresponds to option D.\n```\n<<<D>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
