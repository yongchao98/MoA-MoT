    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Represent the Quantum State:** The state of the spin-half particle is given by `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`. In the standard basis where `|↑⟩` is `[1, 0]` and `|↓⟩` is `[0, 1]`, the state vector `|ψ⟩` can be written as a column vector `[0.5, √3/2]`.\n\n2.  **Represent the Operators:** The Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` in this basis are:\n    *   `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    *   `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    The full operator we are interested in is `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`. We will construct this operator matrix by performing the matrix arithmetic.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:** The expectation value of an operator `O` for a state `|ψ⟩` is calculated as `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`. In matrix notation, this is `ψ† * O * ψ`, where `ψ†` is the conjugate transpose of `ψ`. Since our state vector has real components, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** We will use the `numpy` library to handle the vectors and matrices.\n    *   Define the state vector `ψ`.\n    *   Define the Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x`.\n    *   Calculate the operator `O = 10*σ_z + 5*σ_x`.\n    *   Compute the expectation value `ψ.T @ O @ ψ`.\n    *   Round the final result to one decimal place and compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the quantum state vector\n# |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩ corresponds to the vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]\npsi = np.array([0.5, np.sqrt(3)/2])\n\n# Step 2: Define the Pauli matrices\nsigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], \n                    [0, -1]])\n\nsigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], \n                    [1, 0]])\n\n# Step 3: Construct the full operator O = 10*σ_z + 5*σ_x\noperator_O = 10 * sigma_z + 5 * sigma_x\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the expectation value ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩\n# In numpy, this is calculated as psi.conj().T @ operator_O @ psi\n# Since psi is real, .conj() is not needed and .T on a 1D array doesn't change it for this operation.\n# The expression psi @ operator_O @ psi gives the correct scalar result.\nexpectation_value = psi @ operator_O @ psi\n\n# Round the result to one decimal place\nrounded_expectation_value = round(expectation_value, 1)\n\n# Print the options and the calculated result\nprint(\"The given options are:\")\nprint(\"A) 0.85\")\nprint(\"B) -1.4\")\nprint(\"C) -0.7\")\nprint(\"D) 1.65\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"The state vector |ψ⟩ is: {psi}\")\nprint(f\"The operator O is:\\n{operator_O}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated expectation value ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ is: {expectation_value}\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value rounded to one decimal place is: {rounded_expectation_value}\")\n\n# Determine which option matches the result\nif rounded_expectation_value == 0.85:\n    final_choice = \"A\"\nelif rounded_expectation_value == -1.4:\n    final_choice = \"B\"\nelif rounded_expectation_value == -0.7:\n    final_choice = \"C\"\nelif rounded_expectation_value == 1.65:\n    final_choice = \"D\"\nelse:\n    final_choice = \"None of the above\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value matches option {final_choice}.\")\n<<<C>>>\n```"
