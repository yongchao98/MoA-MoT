    "The user wants me to solve a quantum mechanics problem about the decay of a hydrogen atom state and provide the answer as Python code.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:**\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is a spherically symmetric state ($l=0$).\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Process:** Two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state.\n    *   **Selection Rules:** For a dipole transition, the selection rules are $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ to $l=0$ gives $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to $m=0$ gives $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The problem options specify the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ to $l'=1$ allows for a final state with $l_{final}=0$ or $l_{final}=2$. The target state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ has $l_{final}=0$, so this is allowed.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to $m'$ must result in $m_{final}=0$. This is possible for all three intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Conclusion: All three routes proposed in options A, B, and C are physically possible.\n\n4.  **Calculate Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    *   The core of the problem is to determine the probability of taking a specific path.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric. When it decays, there is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   This means the emission of the first photon is isotropic, and the atom is left in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n    *   Because of the initial symmetry, the probability of ending up in any of the possible $m'$ sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) must be equal.\n    *   Since there are three possible, equally likely intermediate states, the total probability is split three ways.\n    *   Therefore, the probability (or branching ratio) for any one of these specific routes is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   Route A: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/4$. Incorrect.\n    *   Route B: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/3$. **Correct.**\n    *   Route C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/4$. Incorrect.\n    *   Route D: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $2/3$. Incorrect.\n\n6.  **Construct Python Code:**\n    *   The code will formalize the argument that the probabilities are equal by using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which relates the transition probabilities to the square of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   I will use the `sympy.physics.wigner.clebsch_gordan` function to calculate these coefficients for the three possible transitions.\n    *   The code will show that the squared coefficients are equal, confirming the branching ratio is $1/3$ for each path.\n    *   Finally, the code will select and print the correct option based on this result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\ndef solve_hydrogen_decay():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the correct transition route and probability for the H-atom decay\n    from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem describes a two-step decay: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>.\n    # We need to find the probability (branching ratio) for a specific path.\n\n    # The key insight is that the initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0).\n    # Therefore, the decay to the intermediate |2,1,m'> states must be isotropic,\n    # meaning the probability is distributed equally among the possible m' sublevels.\n    # The possible m' values are -1, 0, and 1.
