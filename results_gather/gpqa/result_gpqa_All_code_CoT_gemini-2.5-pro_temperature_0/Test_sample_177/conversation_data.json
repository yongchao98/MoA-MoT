    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and then use this information to assess the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Principle of Dimensional Analysis:** In natural units ($\\hbar=c=1$), the action $S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$ is a dimensionless quantity. Since the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of $[d^4x]_M = -4$, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$. Consequently, every term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n2.  **Mass Dimensions of Fields:** We need the mass dimensions of the fields involved in the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$. For this term to have a dimension of 4, and knowing $[\\partial_\\mu]_M=1$ and $[\\gamma^\\mu]_M=0$, we find that $2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$, which gives $[\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M = 3/2$.\n    *   **Field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this to have a dimension of 4, we must have $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$, which gives $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n    *   **Sigma tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless, so $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Mass Dimension of $\\kappa$**: We set the total mass dimension of the interaction term to 4:\n    $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    Plugging in the known values, we can solve for $[\\kappa]_M$.\n\n4.  **Determine Renormalizability**: A theory is considered non-renormalizable by power-counting if it contains any coupling constant with a negative mass dimension.\n    *   If $[\\text{coupling}]_M < 0$, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n    *   If $[\\text{coupling}]_M \\ge 0$, the theory is renormalizable (or super-renormalizable).\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps to find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lagrangian_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the mass dimension of kappa and determines the renormalizability\n    of the theory described by the Lagrangian L_int = kappa * psi_bar * sigma_munu * psi * F^munu.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define known mass dimensions in natural units.\n    # The Lagrangian density L has a mass dimension of 4.\n    dim_L = 4\n    \n    # Step 2: Mass dimensions of the fields and operators.\n    # Dimension of the fermion field psi is 3/2.\n    dim_psi = 1.5\n    # Dimension of the field strength tensor F^munu is 2.\n    dim_F = 2\n    # Dimension of sigma_munu is 0 as it's built from dimensionless gamma matrices.\n    dim_sigma = 0\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the mass dimension of kappa.\n    # The dimension of the interaction term must be 4:\n    # [L_int] = [kappa] + [psi_bar] + [sigma] + [psi] + [F] = 4\n    # Note: [psi_bar] = [psi]\n    dim_kappa = dim_L - dim_psi - dim_sigma - dim_psi - dim_F\n    \n    # Step 4: Determine renormalizability based on the dimension of kappa.\n    if dim_kappa < 0:\n        renormalizability = \"not renormalizable\"\n    elif dim_kappa == 0:\n        renormalizability = \"renormalizable\"\n    else: # dim_kappa > 0\n        renormalizability = \"super-renormalizable\"\n        \n    # Print the results and the final choice.\n    print(\"1.
