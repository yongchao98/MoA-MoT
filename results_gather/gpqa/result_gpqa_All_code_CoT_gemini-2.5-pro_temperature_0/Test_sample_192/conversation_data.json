    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are told that the number of stars per unit parallax range, which we can write as `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n2.  **State the Goal:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit distance range, `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:** The fundamental relationship between parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) is that they are inversely proportional: `plx = 1/r`.\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule:** To convert the derivative with respect to parallax into a derivative with respect to distance, we use the chain rule from calculus: `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`.\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:** We differentiate the relation `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    *   `plx = r⁻¹`\n    *   `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    *   Since star counts must be positive, we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship, so we'll use `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now we substitute all the pieces back into the chain rule equation.\n    *   `dN/dr` is proportional to `(dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    *   `dN/dr` is proportional to `(1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`\n7.  **Express in Terms of `r`:** Finally, we replace `plx` with `1/r` to get the entire expression in terms of distance `r`.\n    *   `dN/dr` is proportional to `(1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    *   `dN/dr` is proportional to `(r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    *   `dN/dr` is proportional to `r³`\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic calculations and confirm the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols for our variables\nr, plx = sympy.symbols('r plx')\n\n# Step 1: We are given that the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/d(plx))\n# is proportional to 1/plx^5.\n# Let's represent this proportionality.\ndN_dplx_proportionality = 1/plx**5\n\n# Step 2: The relationship between parallax (plx) and distance (r) is plx = 1/r.\n# We need to find the derivative d(plx)/dr to use in the chain rule.\ndplx_dr = sympy.diff(1/r, r)\n\n# Step 3: Use the chain rule: dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr).\n# We are interested in how the number density changes, so we use the magnitude (absolute value)\n# of the derivative.\n# dN/dr is proportional to (1/plx^5) * |d(plx)/dr|\ndN_dr_proportionality = dN_dplx_proportionality * abs(dplx_dr)\n\n# Step 4: Substitute plx = 1/r into the expression to get the final relationship in terms of r.\nfinal_proportionality = dN_dr_proportionality.subs(plx, 1/r)\n\n# Step 5: Simplify the expression.\nsimplified_proportionality = sympy.simplify(final_proportionality)\n\n# Print the final result and the corresponding choice.\nprint(\"The number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) is proportional to:\", simplified_proportionality)\nprint(\"This means the relationship is ~ r^3.\")\nprint(\"The correct option is D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
