    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circular aperture of radius 'a' as N tends to infinity. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the physical model:** The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the dark fringes (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n2.  **Recall the formula for minima:** The condition for the n-th minimum is given by `k * a * sin(θ_n) = z_n`, where:\n    *   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `θ_n` is the angular position of the n-th minimum.\n    *   `z_n` is the n-th zero of the J₁(x) Bessel function.\n3.  **Apply the small-angle approximation:** The problem states we can use `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula becomes `(2π / λ) * a * θ_n = z_n`.\n4.  **Solve for the angular position:** Rearranging the formula, we get `θ_n = (z_n / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n5.  **Find the required values:** We need the first two zeros of the J₁(x) function.\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`.\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`.\n6.  **Calculate the angular positions:**\n    *   Position of the first minimum: `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n    *   Position of the second minimum: `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n7.  **Calculate the angular distance:** The required quantity is the difference between these two positions: `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n8.  **Compare with options:** I will compute the numerical coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)` and match it with the given choices.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is about Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture,\n# which is the limit of an N-sided polygon as N -> infinity.\n# The radius of the circle is the apothem 'a'.\n\n# The angular positions of the minima are given by the zeros of the\n# first-order Bessel function, J1(x).\n# The condition for the n-th minimum is: a * sin(theta_n) = (z_n / (2*pi)) * lambda\n# Using the small angle approximation sin(theta) ~ theta:\n# theta_n = (z_n / (2*pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# where z_n is the n-th zero of J1(x).\n\n# Zeros of the first-order Bessel function J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317  # First zero\nz2 = 7.0156  # Second zero\n\n# The angular position of the first minimum (theta_1) is proportional to lambda/a.\n# The coefficient is z1 / (2*pi).\ncoeff_theta1 = z1 / (2 * math.pi)\n\n# The angular position of the second minimum (theta_2) is proportional to lambda/a.\n# The coefficient is z2 / (2*pi).\ncoeff_theta2 = z2 / (2 * math.pi)\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is theta_2 - theta_1.\n# The coefficient for the angular distance is coeff_theta2 - coeff_theta1.\ndelta_coeff = coeff_theta2 - coeff_theta1\n\n# The options are given as coefficients for lambda / a\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 0.500,\n    \"B\": 0.506,\n    \"C\": 1.220,\n    \"D\": 0.610\n}\n\nprint(f\"The angular position of the first minimum is approximately {coeff_theta1:.3f} * (lambda / a)\")\nprint(f\"The angular position of the second minimum is approximately {coeff_theta2:.3f} * (lambda / a)\")\nprint(f\"The angular distance between the first two minima is (theta_2 - theta_1).\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient for this distance is {coeff_theta2:.3f} - {coeff_theta1:.3f} = {delta_coeff:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing the calculated coefficient with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 0.500\")\nprint(f\"B) 0.506\")\nprint(f\"C) 1.220\")\nprint(f\"D) 0.610\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated coefficient {delta_coeff:.3f} is closest to option B.\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```"
