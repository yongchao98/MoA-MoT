    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total electrostatic potential energy of the system of 13 charges when it is in its minimum energy state.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the components of the total energy:** The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can divide these interactions into two groups:\n    a) The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the outer shell (`U_center_shell`).\n    b) The potential energy from the mutual interactions among the 12 charges on the shell (`U_shell_shell`).\n\n2.  **Calculate `U_center_shell`:** There are 12 pairs, each consisting of the central charge `q` and a shell charge `q`, separated by a distance `r`. The energy for one such pair is `k * q^2 / r`. So, the total for all 12 pairs is `U_center_shell = 12 * k * q^2 / r`.\n\n3.  **Calculate `U_shell_shell`:** The 12 charges on the shell will repel each other and arrange themselves to minimize their potential energy. This is a well-known physics problem called the \"Thomson problem\". For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is an icosahedron. The potential energy for this configuration is given by `U_shell_shell = E_12 * k * q^2 / r`, where `E_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of inverse distances for the icosahedral arrangement on a unit sphere. The accepted value for `E_12` is approximately 49.165335.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total energy:** The total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n    `U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell = (12 * k * q^2 / r) + (E_12 * k * q^2 / r) = (12 + E_12) * k * q^2 / r`.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:** The Python code below will define the necessary constants (`k`, `e`), calculate the charge `q`, and then use the formula above to compute the total energy. Finally, it will print the result and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants and problem parameters\nk = 8.9875517923e9  # Coulomb's constant in N·m²/C²\ne = 1.602176634e-19 # Elementary charge in C\nr = 2.0             # Radius in meters\nN_shell = 12        # Number of particles on the shell\n\n# The charge of each particle is 2e\nq = 2 * e\n\n# The dimensionless energy constant for the Thomson problem with N=12 (icosahedron)\nE_12 = 49.165335\n\n# The total energy is the sum of the energy from the central charge interacting\n# with the shell charges, and the energy of the shell charges interacting with each other.\n# U_total = (N_shell * k * q^2 / r) + (E_12 * k * q^2 / r)\n# U_total = (N_shell + E_12) * k * q^2 / r\n\ntotal_factor = N_shell + E_12\nenergy_unit = k * q**2 / r\ntotal_energy = total_factor * energy_unit\n\n# Format the result to three decimal places in scientific notation\n# to compare with the given options.\nformatted_energy = \"{:.3e}\".format(total_energy)\nmantissa, exponent = formatted_energy.split('e')\nfinal_output = f\"{mantissa} x 10^{int(exponent)}\"\n\nprint(f\"The calculated minimum energy of the system is: {final_output} Joules.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 7.056 x 10^-27\")\nprint(\"B) 122.330\")\nprint(\"C) 2.822 x 10^-26\")\nprint(\"D) 5.645 x 10^-26\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
