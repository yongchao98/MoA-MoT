    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Normalization Principle:** In quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. This means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space it can exist must be equal to 1. The probability density is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, `|ψ(x)|²`.\n2.  **Calculate Probability Density:** The wave function is a complex number `ψ(x) = Re(x) + i*Im(x)`.\n    *   Real part: `Re(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n    *   Imaginary part: `Im(x) = -0.5`\n    The square of its magnitude is `|ψ(x)|² = (Re(x))² + (Im(x))²`.\n    *   `|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n3.  **Set up the Integral:** We need to integrate the probability density over the region where the particle is found, which is from x=1 to x=3. The result of this integral must be 1.\n    *   `∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1`\n4.  **Solve the Integral:** We can solve this integral analytically.\n    *   `∫(a²/(1+x)) dx = a² * ln(1+x)`\n    *   `∫(0.25) dx = 0.25 * x`\n    *   So, the definite integral is `[a² * ln(1+x) + 0.25*x]` evaluated from 1 to 3.\n5.  **Apply the Limits:**\n    *   `[a² * ln(1+3) + 0.25*3] - [a² * ln(1+1) + 0.25*1] = 1`\n    *   `[a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25] = 1`\n    *   `a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(m) - ln(n) = ln(m/n)`, we get `ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2)`.\n    *   `a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n6.  **Solve for 'a':**\n    *   `a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n    *   `a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n    *   `a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))`\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** We will use Python to compute the final value of 'a' and compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem of finding 'a' boils down to solving the equation:\n# a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n# where ln is the natural logarithm.\n\n# Calculate the value of ln(2)\nln_2 = math.log(2)\n\n# Calculate a^2\na_squared = 0.5 / ln_2\n\n# Calculate a (we take the positive root)\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\n# Print the numerical value of 'a'\nprint(f\"The calculated numerical value of 'a' is: {a}\")\n\n# The given options are:\n# A) 1.1\n# B) 0.6\n# C) 0.85\n# D) 0.35\n\n# The calculated value is approximately 0.849, which is closest to 0.85.\nprint(\"The closest option is C.\")\nprint(\"The final answer is C\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
