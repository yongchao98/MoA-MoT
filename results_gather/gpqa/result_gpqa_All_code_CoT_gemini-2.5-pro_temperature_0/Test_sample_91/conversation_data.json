    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:** I will first determine the chemical formula of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 by counting the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Count the Bonds:** I will carefully count the number of each type of bond (C-H, C-C, and C=C) in the molecule. I will use the valency formula `N_CC = (4*C - H - 4*N_C=C) / 2` to verify my manual count of C-C single bonds.\n3.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound:** Using the given bond energies, I will calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. This is the sum of the energies of all bonds.\n    *   ΔH_atom(compound) = Σ (Bond Energies)\n4.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements:** I will calculate the total energy required to form the constituent gaseous atoms (12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g)) from their elements in their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)).\n    *   ΔH_atom(H) is half the bond energy of H-H.\n    *   ΣΔH_atom(elements) = 12 * ΔH_atom(C) + 22 * ΔH_atom(H)\n5.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):** The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n    *   ΔH_f = ΣΔH_atom(elements) - ΔH_atom(compound)\n6.  **Check Units and Select Answer:** The result will be in kJ/mol. I will check if this matches any option. If not, I will convert the units to kJ/g by calculating the molar mass of the compound and dividing the result by it. Then, I will compare this new value with the given options to find the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# --- Step 1: Define given data and molecular properties ---\n# Given bond energies and enthalpies of atomization in kJ/mol\nBE_CH = 400\nBE_CC = 200\nBE_CeqC = 300\nBE_HH = 100\ndelta_H_atom_C = 1000\n\n# The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n# Molecular Formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# --- Step 2: Count the number of each type of bond ---\n# Number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\n# Number of C=C double bonds is clear from the structure\nnum_CeqC_bonds = 2\n# Number of C-C single bonds can be calculated from valency rules:\n# Sum of valencies = 4*num_C + 1*num_H = 2 * (N_CC + 2*N_C=C + N_CH)\n# 4*12 + 22 = 2 * (N_CC + 2*2 + 22) => 70 = 2 * (N_CC + 26) => 35 = N_CC + 26 => N_CC = 9\nnum_CC_bonds = 9\n\nprint(f\"Analysis of the molecule C{num_C}H{num_H}:\")\nprint(f\" - Number of C-H bonds: {num_CH_bonds}\")\nprint(f\" - Number of C-C bonds: {num_CC_bonds}\")\nprint(f\" - Number of C=C bonds: {num_CeqC_bonds}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound ---\n# This is the sum of all bond energies in the molecule\ndelta_H_atom_compound = (num_CH_bonds * BE_CH) + (num_CC_bonds * BE_CC) + (num_CeqC_bonds * BE_CeqC)\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization of the compound (sum of bond energies):\")\nprint(f\"  = (22 * {BE_CH}) + (9 * {BE_CC}) + (2 * {BE_CeqC})\")\nprint(f\"  = {22 * BE_CH} + {9 * BE_CC} + {2 * BE_CeqC} = {delta_H_atom_compound} kJ/mol\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the constituent elements ---\n# Enthalpy of atomization for H is half the H-H bond energy\ndelta_H_atom_H = BE_HH / 2\n# Total enthalpy for forming gaseous atoms from elements in standard state\ndelta_H_atom_elements = (num_C * delta_H_atom_C) + (num_H * delta_H_atom_H)\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization of constituent elements:\")\nprint(f\"  = (12 * ΔH_atom(C)) + (22 * ΔH_atom(H))\")\nprint(f\"  = (12 * {delta_H_atom_C}) + (22 * {delta_H_atom_H})\")\nprint(f\"  = {12 * delta_H_atom_C} + {22 * delta_H_atom_H} = {delta_H_atom_elements} kJ/mol\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) ---\n# ΔH_f = ΣΔH_atom(elements) - ΔH_atom(compound)\ndelta_H_f_mol = delta_H_atom_elements - delta_H_atom_compound\nprint(f\"Calculated enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) in kJ/mol:\")\nprint(f\"  ΔH_f = {delta_H_atom_elements} - {delta_H_atom_compound} = {delta_H_f_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 6: Check units and select the final answer ---\n# Calculate molar mass of C12H22 (using integer masses as is common in such problems)\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\n# Convert ΔH_f from kJ/mol to kJ/g\ndelta_H_f_gram = delta_H_f_mol / molar_mass\nprint(f\"Converting to kJ/g to match options:\")\nprint(f\"  Molar Mass of C12H22 ≈ {molar_mass} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"  ΔH_f in kJ/g = {delta_H_f_mol} kJ/mol / {molar_mass} g/mol = {delta_H_f_gram:.2f} kJ/g\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Compare with the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"67.4 kJ/mol\",\n    \"B\": \"11200 kJ/mol\",\n    \"C\": \"11.44 kJ/g\",\n    \"D\": \"1900 kJ/g\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Comparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) {options['A']}\")\nprint(f\"B) {options['B']} (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not formation)\")\nprint(f\"C) {options['C']} (This matches our calculated value of {delta_H_f_gram:.2f} kJ/g)\")\nprint(f\"D) {options['D']} (The numerical value matches ΔH_f in kJ/mol, but the units are incorrect)\")\nprint(\"\\nThe correct choice is C.\")\n\n# Restore stdout\nsys.stdout = old_stdout\n# Print the captured output\nprint(captured_output.getvalue())\n```\n<<<C>>>"
