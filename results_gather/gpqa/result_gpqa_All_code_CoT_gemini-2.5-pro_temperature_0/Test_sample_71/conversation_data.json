    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Step 1: Formation of the reactive intermediate and Product 1.**\n    *   The starting material `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is treated with sodium iodide (NaI). While the name is complex, this combination of a gem-dihalide precursor and NaI is a known method for generating a highly reactive diene *in situ*. The most plausible intermediate formed is `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`, also known as **o-xylylene**.\n    *   This reactive diene, o-xylylene, then participates in a Diels-Alder reaction with `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (a dienophile).\n    *   Since 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used, both double bonds of the bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene react, each with one molecule of o-xylylene, to form a symmetric bis-adduct, which is product **1**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Step 2: Formation of Product 2.**\n    *   Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard condition for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether.\n    *   The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH). Product **2** is the alcohol corresponding to the ether **1**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Step 3: Formation of Product 3.**\n    *   Product **2** (a secondary alcohol) is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild reaction that oxidizes a secondary alcohol to a ketone.\n    *   The hydroxyl group at position 7 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O). Product **3** is the resulting ketone.\n\n4.  **Analyze Step 4: Formation of the Final Product 4.**\n    *   Product **3**, a Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. Heating often reverses the Diels-Alder reaction. This is called a retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   The reaction breaks **3** apart, regenerating the initial components: two molecules of o-xylylene and one molecule of `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n    *   `Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is thermally unstable and readily decomposes by extruding carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene.\n    *   The two molecules of o-xylylene, being highly reactive and generated at high temperature, react with each other. A common thermal reaction for o-xylylene is dimerization. The [4+4] cycloaddition is a known pathway, yielding `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene` as a major product. This dimer is our final product, **4**.\n\n5.  **Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens in Product 4.**\n    *   The structure of **4** is `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`.\n    *   This molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry. This symmetry makes atoms on one half of the molecule equivalent to corresponding atoms on the other half.\n    *   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** There are two benzene rings, but due to symmetry, we only need to analyze one. On a single benzene ring, all four hydrogens are in chemically different environments. Therefore, there are **4** distinct types of aromatic hydrogens.\n    *   **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** The molecule has two `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridges. Due to C₂ symmetry, the two bridges are equivalent. Let's analyze one bridge. The two `-CH₂-` groups within the bridge are in different environments. Furthermore, the two hydrogens on each `-CH₂-` group are diastereotopic (not equivalent). This results in **4** distinct types of aliphatic hydrogens.\n    *   **Total:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = 8.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the key intermediate.\n# The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with NaI generates o-xylylene.\n# o-xylylene is a reactive diene.\n\n# Step 2: Identify the reaction sequence.\n# The sequence involves:\n# 1.
