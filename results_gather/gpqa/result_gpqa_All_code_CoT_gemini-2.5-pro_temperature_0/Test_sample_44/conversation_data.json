    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They are confined to a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`. The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`, so the energy of the n-th level is simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` (energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (spin up or spin down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n4.  **Calculate Ground State Energy (E_ground):** To find the ground state energy, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n    *   The lowest level is `n=1`. We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n    *   The next lowest level is `n=2`. We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n5.  **Calculate First Excited State Energy (E_first):** To get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the next available unoccupied level.\n    *   The ground state configuration has particles in `n=1` and `n=2`.\n    *   We promote one particle from `n=2` to the next level, `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is: `(2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n6.  **Calculate Second Excited State Energy (E_second):** This is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider different possible promotions from the ground state.\n    *   **Possibility 1:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = `(1 * 1^2 * E) + (2 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1` and two in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 * E) + (2 * 3^2 * E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   The lower of these energies is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is `18E`.\n\n7.  **Final Result:** The energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option B. I will now write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_particle_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and\n    second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a\n    1D infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The energy of a single particle in state n is n^2 * E.\n    # We can treat E as 1 for calculation purposes and append \"E\" to the final result.\n\n    # Ground State:\n    # To minimize energy, we fill the lowest available levels.\n    # Each level n can hold 2 particles (spin up, spin down).\n    # We have 4 particles.\n    # 2 particles go into n=1 level.\n    # 2 particles go into n=2 level.\n    e_ground = 2 * (1**2) + 2 * (2**2)\n\n    # First Excited State:\n    # Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the\n    # next available level (n=3).\n    # Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    e_first_excited = 2 * (1**2) + 1 * (2**2) + 1 * (3**2)\n\n    # Second Excited State:\n    # This is the next-lowest energy configuration.
