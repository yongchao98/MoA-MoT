    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**: This energy arises from the interaction of the atom's magnetic dipole moment with the external magnetic field (Zeeman effect). The formula is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B$, where:\n    *   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton ($5.788 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV/T).\n    *   $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem specifies a small value, so we'll use $m=1$.\n    *   $B$ is the magnetic field strength, given as $1$ T.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy of a photon with the given wavelength. The formula is $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where:\n    *   $hc$ is the product of Planck's constant and the speed of light, which is approximately $1240$ eVÂ·nm.\n    *   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, given as $0.4861 \\mu m$. We will convert this to nanometers (nm) for the calculation.\n\n3.  **Compare the Magnitudes**: Once both energies are calculated in the same unit (electron-volts, eV), we will compare their orders of magnitude to determine which of the given options (A, B, C, or D) is correct.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define physical constants and given parameters\n# Bohr magneton in eV/T\nmu_B = 5.7883818012e-5  # eV/T\n# Product of Planck's constant and speed of light in eV*nm\nhc = 1240  # eV*nm\n\n# Magnetic field in Tesla\nB = 1.0  # T\n# A small, non-zero orbital magnetic quantum number\nm = 1\n# Wavelength in micrometers\nlambda_um = 0.4861  # micrometers\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy <H>\n# Convert wavelength to nanometers for the Delta E calculation\nlambda_nm = lambda_um * 1000\n\n# The paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman energy shift\nH_para = m * mu_B * B\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the transition energy Delta E\nDelta_E = hc / lambda_nm\n\n# Step 4: Compare the two energies and print the results\nprint(\"--- Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {H_para:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E = {Delta_E:.3f} eV\")\n\n# Determine the relationship\nratio = H_para / Delta_E\nprint(f\"Ratio <H> / Delta E = {ratio:.3e}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Comparison ---\")\nprint(f\"The order of magnitude for <H> is approximately 10^{int(math.log10(H_para))} eV.\")\nprint(f\"The order of magnitude for Delta E is approximately 10^{int(math.log10(Delta_E))} eV.\")\nprint(\"Since the ratio is extremely small, it is clear that <H> is much, much smaller than Delta E.\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\nprint(\"The correct relationship is:\")\nprint(\"A) <H> > Delta E\")\nprint(\"B) <H> = Delta E\")\nprint(\"C) <H> << Delta E\")\nprint(\"D) <H> >> Delta E\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer: C\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
