The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Chemical Principle**\nIn a solution with a metal ion (Co²⁺) and a ligand (SCN⁻) that form multiple complexes, the distribution of the metal among the different species (free ion and various complexes) depends on the ligand concentration and the stability constants (β) of the complexes. The percentage of any given species can be calculated using its mole fraction (α).\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation**\nThe mole fraction of the nth complex, αₙ, is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))\nwhere [L] is the concentration of the free ligand.\n\nFor our specific case, we want to find the fraction of the second complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so we need to calculate α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Check the Assumptions and Values**\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n*   **Assumption:** The total cobalt concentration (c(Co) = 10⁻² M) is significantly lower than the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is small, so we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as its total concentration, 0.1 M. This is a standard and valid assumption for this type of problem.\n*   **Note:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for the calculation of the percentage distribution, as it cancels out in the mole fraction formula.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nLet's calculate the numerator and the denominator of the α₂ formula.\n\n*   **Numerator:**\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator:** This is the sum of all terms from the free ion (term = 1) up to the fourth complex.\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator:** 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculate the fraction (α₂):**\n    *   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage:**\n    *   Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\n**6.

A review of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculation correctly to arrive at 16.9%, several made errors in matching this result to the correct letter option. The calculation itself is consistently correct across all agents.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Chemical Principles**\nThis is a complexometric equilibrium problem. The distribution of different complex species (`Co²⁺`, `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, etc.) depends on the concentration of the free ligand (`[SCN⁻]`) and the overall stability constants (β) for each complex.\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation**\nThe fraction (α₂) of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species `c(Co)`. This fraction can be calculated using the following formula, which is derived from the definitions of the stability constants:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, we calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSumming the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nNow, we calculate the fraction α₂:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, we convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Correct Formula**: All candidate answers correctly identified and used the standard formula for calculating the mole fraction of a complex species.\n*   **Ligand Concentration**: A key assumption, correctly made by all candidates, is that the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its total concentration (0.1 M). This is a valid approximation because the thiocyanate is in a 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt (`10⁻² M`).\n*   **Numerical Accuracy**: The arithmetic calculation `0.4 / 2.3646` yields approximately 0.169.

This value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first determining the correct formula for the mole fraction of the desired species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all species containing cobalt in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify All Cobalt-Containing Species**\nIn a solution of Co(II) and thiocyanate, a series of complexation equilibria exist. The species present are:\n*   The free (aquated) cobalt ion: `Co²⁺`\n*   The monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   The dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n*   The trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   The tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**3. Formulate the Mole Fraction Equation**\nThe percentage of a specific species is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (α₂) is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species, `c(Co)`.\n\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed using the overall stability constants (βₙ) and the concentrations of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`.\n`[[Co(SCN)ₙ]^(2-n)] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each complex, we can factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, substituting these into the equation for α₂:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the stability constants and the free ligand concentration:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. List Careful Points and Perform the Calculation**\n*   **Careful Point 1: Ligand Concentration.** The problem gives the total thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. Since the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration, the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` is equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Correctly identifying the numerator.** The question asks for the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so the numerator must be the term corresponding to this species, which is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`.\n\n**Calculation:**\nGiven values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n*   Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nCalculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]` = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nCalculate the mole fraction α₂:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nConvert to percentage:\n*   Percentage = `α₂` * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n**5.

Identify the Relevant Chemical Principles**\nIn a solution containing a metal ion (Co²⁺) and a ligand (SCN⁻), a series of complexes will form. The distribution of these species depends on the ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β) for each complex. The percentage of any given species can be found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100.\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation**\nThe mole fraction (α₂) of the target complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is given by the formula:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nWhere:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` is the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex.\n*   `c(Co)` is the total concentration of all cobalt species: `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), this formula can be expressed in terms of the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. List Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The problem provides a total thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. Because the ligand is in a tenfold excess, it is a standard and valid chemical assumption to approximate the free (equilibrium) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as being equal to the total initial concentration, so `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Correct Formula:** The mole fraction formula must include the term '1' in the denominator to account for the free Co²⁺ ions.\n*   **Correct Constants:** The numerator must use the stability constant corresponding to the desired complex. For `[Co(SCN)₂]`, this is β₂.\n*   **Final Step:** The calculated mole fraction (α₂) must be converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nCalculate the mole fraction (α₂):\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nConvert to percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculation consistently yields approximately 16.9%. All the provided candidate answers perform this calculation correctly. The discrepancy in their final answers lies in incorrectly matching the calculated value to the given options. The value 16.9% corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (αₙ) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is given by the ratio of its concentration to the total concentration of all cobalt species. This can be expressed using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n\nα₂ = `[[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nThis simplifies to a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified this fundamental formula.\n\n**3. List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the concentration of the *free* thiocyanate ligand, `[SCN⁻]`, at equilibrium. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the thiocyanate is in large excess. Therefore, it is a valid and standard assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to the total initial concentration, i.e., `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not directly needed to calculate the *percentage* distribution of the species. The `[Co²⁺]` term, which is a function of c(Co), cancels out from the numerator and denominator of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Denominator Terms:** The denominator of the fraction represents the sum of the relative concentrations of all cobalt-containing species. It is crucial to include the term '1', which represents the free `Co²⁺` ion, in addition to the terms for each of the four complexes.\n*   **Calculation:** Each term in the formula must be calculated precisely, paying close attention to the exponents on the ligand concentration (`[SCN⁻]`, `[SCN⁻]²`, `[SCN⁻]³`, `[SCN⁻]⁴`).\n\n**4.

The core of the problem is to calculate the mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. The formula for this mole fraction is unanimously and correctly identified as:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**2. Analysis of the Calculation**\n\nThe next step is to substitute the given values into this formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's verify the calculation performed by the candidate agents:\n\n*   **Numerator**:\n    β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (β₀): **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n*   **Sum of Denominator Terms**:\n    1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculation of Mole Fraction (α₂)**:\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ **0.16916**\n\n*   **Conversion to Percentage**:\n    Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\nThe calculation is robust and consistently yields approximately 16.9%. All candidate answers that show their work arrive at this numerical result.\n\n**3. Careful Points**\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The calculation relies on the assumption that the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, [SCN⁻], is approximately equal to its total initial concentration (0.1 M). This is a valid assumption because the total thiocyanate concentration is in ten-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction of it will be consumed to form complexes.\n*   **Inclusion of the Free Ion:** It is crucial to include the '1' in the denominator, which represents the fraction of free Co²⁺ ions relative to itself. All candidates correctly included this term.\n*   **Mapping to Multiple Choice Options:** The primary discrepancy among the candidate answers is not in the calculation itself, but in mapping the result (16.9%) to the correct lettered option. The provided options are A) 42.3%, B) 38.1%, C) 25.6%, and D) 16.9%. The calculated value of 16.9% clearly matches option D. Several candidate answers incorrectly selected A, B, or C despite performing the calculation correctly.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe methodology and the numerical calculation are consistently correct across all provided answers, leading to a result of 16.9%. This value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Chemical Species and Equilibria**\nThe solution contains free cobalt ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻). They form a series of complexes, and the total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**3. Formulate the Mathematical Expression**\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)ₙ]`, is denoted by `αₙ`. We are interested in `α₂`, the fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`. This fraction can be calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]). The formula is derived by expressing the concentration of each species in terms of `[Co²⁺]`, `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants, and then simplifying the ratio. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThis formula is correctly identified and used by all the candidate answers.\n\n**4. Check the Given Values and Assumptions**\n*   Stability constants: `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`\n*   Thiocyanate concentration: `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n*   Total cobalt concentration: `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`\n\nA key point is the assumption about the thiocyanate concentration. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the concentration of free thiocyanate at equilibrium is equal to its initial total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. This assumption is correctly made in the candidate solutions.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nLet's verify the calculation performed by the agents.\n\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): `1`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n*   **Sum of Denominator Terms**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the fraction (α₂)**:\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThe calculation is robust and consistently yields approximately `16.9%`.\n\n**6. Match with the Options**\nThe calculated value is `16.9%`. Now we compare this to the options provided in the original question:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value matches option B. The confusion in the candidate answers (where some select A, C, or D) seems to stem from a misinterpretation of the option letters, but their underlying calculation is correct. Based on a rigorous check of the method and the arithmetic, the result is unequivocally 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Identify the Relevant Chemical Principles**\nIn a solution with a metal ion (Co²⁺) and a ligand (SCN⁻), a series of complexes will form. The distribution of these species depends on the ligand concentration and the stability constants (β) of each complex. The fraction of any given complex `[Co(SCN)n]` can be calculated without knowing the total metal concentration, as it cancels out.\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation**\nThe fraction (αₙ) of a complex `[Co(L)ₙ]` is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ)) for i = 1 to the maximum coordination number.\n\nFor our specific case, we want to find the fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, which is α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4.

Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, let's calculate the value of each term in the formula.\n\n*   **Numerator:**\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = **0.0016**\n\n*   **Sum of Denominator Terms:**\n    *   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculate the Fraction (α₂):**\n    *   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage:**\n    *   Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% = **16.916%**\n\n**6.

However, many of them incorrectly map this result to the wrong letter option (e.g., A, B, or D). The reasoning and calculation are consistently correct across the board, but the final selection is often flawed. Based on the correct calculation and the provided options, the answer must be C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying key points.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Chemical System**\nThe solution contains a central metal ion, Co²⁺, and a ligand, SCN⁻. They react to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free ion and all the complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation Strategy**\nThe percentage of a specific species is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the target complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is denoted as α₂.\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nUsing the provided overall stability constants (β), the concentration of each complex can be related to the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`.\n`[[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)] = βn * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]^n`\n\nBy substituting these relationships into the mole fraction formula, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving an equation that depends only on the stability constants and the free ligand concentration. This is a crucial simplification that all candidate answers correctly identified.\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Address Careful Points and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Free Ligand Concentration.** The formula requires the *free* (equilibrium) ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem gives the *total* concentration, 0.1 M. However, since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total concentration.\n    *   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"1\" in the Denominator.** The denominator of the fraction represents the sum of the relative amounts of all species. The \"1\" term (corresponding to β₀=1) represents the free `Co²⁺` ion and must be included. All candidate answers correctly included this term.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n*   Numerator = `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nNext, calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nCalculate the mole fraction α₂:\n*   `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = `α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**6.

Use the Given Values**\n*   Stability constants: `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`\n*   Ligand concentration: `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. This is a valid approximation for the free ligand concentration because the total thiocyanate (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt (0.01 M).\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nLet's calculate the numerator and denominator separately.\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   Term 0 (for `Co²⁺`): `1`\n    *   Term 1 (`β₁[SCN⁻]`): `9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   Term 2 (`β₂[SCN⁻]²`): `40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term 3 (`β₃[SCN⁻]³`): `63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term 4 (`β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`): `16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n*   **Sum of Denominator Terms**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nFinally, convert this fraction to a percentage:\n`Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe calculation was also verified by the Python code execution, which yielded `16.916%`.\n\n**6.

The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species (where n=2) is calculated using the concentrations of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]) and the overall stability constants (βₙ). The formula, which is correctly identified by all candidate answers, is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    The percentage is then `α₂ * 100`.\n\n3.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   Concentration of thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constant β₁ = 9\n    *   Stability constant β₂ = 40\n    *   Stability constant β₃ = 63\n    *   Stability constant β₄ = 16\n\n4.  **Address Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Ligand Concentration:** The total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M).

Formulate the Calculation Strategy**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, denoted as α₂, can be calculated using a formula that relates the concentrations of all species through the stability constants.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the stability constants, we can express each complex's concentration in terms of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe mole fraction α₂ is the ratio of the concentration of `[Co(SCN)₂]` to the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstituting the expressions, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The problem provides the total thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. Since this is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M), the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, as 0.1 M. This is a standard and valid assumption for this type of problem.\n\n*   **Calculate the numerator**:\n    Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n*   **Calculate the terms in the denominator**:\n    *   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n\n*   **Sum the denominator**:\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n*   **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂)**:\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to percentage**:\n    Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n**5.

    "To determine the final answer, a thorough analysis of the problem is necessary, focusing on the correct methodology, calculations, and potential pitfalls identified in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Governing Chemical Principle and Formula**\nThe distribution of different complex species in a solution is described by their mole fractions (αₙ). The mole fraction of the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), is calculated using the overall stability constants (βₙ) and the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]). The correct formula, which all candidate answers identified, is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe final percentage is obtained by multiplying the mole fraction α₂ by 100.\n\n**3. List Careful Points and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). Since the total ligand concentration is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M), the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, it is a valid and standard chemical assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to the total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not required to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species. The term for the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Denominator Structure:** The denominator of the formula represents the sum of the relative concentrations of all cobalt-containing species. It is crucial to include the term '1', which represents the free `Co²⁺` ion (where β₀ = 1).\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The most significant source of error among the candidate answers was not the calculation itself, but correctly matching the numerical result to the corresponding lettered option from the original question.\n\n**4.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Chemical Principle**\nIn a solution with a metal ion (Co²⁺) and a ligand (SCN⁻) that form multiple complexes, the distribution of the metal among the different species (free ion and various complexes) depends on the ligand concentration and the stability constants (β) of the complexes. The percentage of any given species can be calculated using its mole fraction (α).\n\n**3.

This means the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is small, so we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as its total concentration, 0.1 M. This is a standard and valid assumption for this type of problem.\n*   **Note:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for the calculation of the percentage distribution, as it cancels out in the mole fraction formula.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nLet's calculate the numerator and the denominator of the α₂ formula.\n\n*   **Numerator:**\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator:** This is the sum of all terms from the free ion (term = 1) up to the fourth complex.\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator:** 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculate the fraction (α₂):**\n    *   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage:**\n    *   Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\n**6.

Identify the Chemical Principles**\nThis is a complexometric equilibrium problem. The distribution of different complex species (`Co²⁺`, `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, etc.) depends on the concentration of the free ligand (`[SCN⁻]`) and the overall stability constants (β) for each complex.\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation**\nThe fraction (α₂) of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species `c(Co)`. This fraction can be calculated using the following formula, which is derived from the definitions of the stability constants:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4.

Identify All Cobalt-Containing Species**\nIn a solution of Co(II) and thiocyanate, a series of complexation equilibria exist. The species present are:\n*   The free (aquated) cobalt ion: `Co²⁺`\n*   The monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   The dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n*   The trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   The tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**3. Formulate the Mole Fraction Equation**\nThe percentage of a specific species is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (α₂) is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species, `c(Co)`.\n\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed using the overall stability constants (βₙ) and the concentrations of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`.\n`[[Co(SCN)ₙ]^(2-n)] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each complex, we can factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, substituting these into the equation for α₂:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the stability constants and the free ligand concentration:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4.

The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. Since the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration, the ligand is in large excess.

Formulate the Calculation**\nThe mole fraction (α₂) of the target complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is given by the formula:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nWhere:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` is the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex.\n*   `c(Co)` is the total concentration of all cobalt species: `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), this formula can be expressed in terms of the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. List Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The problem provides a total thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. Because the ligand is in a tenfold excess, it is a standard and valid chemical assumption to approximate the free (equilibrium) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as being equal to the total initial concentration, so `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Correct Formula:** The mole fraction formula must include the term '1' in the denominator to account for the free Co²⁺ ions.\n*   **Correct Constants:** The numerator must use the stability constant corresponding to the desired complex. For `[Co(SCN)₂]`, this is β₂.\n*   **Final Step:** The calculated mole fraction (α₂) must be converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nCalculate the mole fraction (α₂):\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nConvert to percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculation consistently yields approximately 16.9%. All the provided candidate answers perform this calculation correctly. The discrepancy in their final answers lies in incorrectly matching the calculated value to the given options. The value 16.9% corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (αₙ) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is given by the ratio of its concentration to the total concentration of all cobalt species. This can be expressed using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n\nα₂ = `[[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nThis simplifies to a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified this fundamental formula.\n\n**3. List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the concentration of the *free* thiocyanate ligand, `[SCN⁻]`, at equilibrium. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the thiocyanate is in large excess. Therefore, it is a valid and standard assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to the total initial concentration, i.e., `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not directly needed to calculate the *percentage* distribution of the species. The `[Co²⁺]` term, which is a function of c(Co), cancels out from the numerator and denominator of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Denominator Terms:** The denominator of the fraction represents the sum of the relative concentrations of all cobalt-containing species. It is crucial to include the term '1', which represents the free `Co²⁺` ion, in addition to the terms for each of the four complexes.\n*   **Calculation:** Each term in the formula must be calculated precisely, paying close attention to the exponents on the ligand concentration (`[SCN⁻]`, `[SCN⁻]²`, `[SCN⁻]³`, `[SCN⁻]⁴`).\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator of the fraction for α₂:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺: **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nCalculate the mole fraction, α₂:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe calculation consistently yields approximately 16.9%. Comparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.

Analysis of the Method**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the method for solving this problem. The core of the problem is to calculate the mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. The formula for this mole fraction is unanimously and correctly identified as:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**2. Analysis of the Calculation**\n\nThe next step is to substitute the given values into this formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's verify the calculation performed by the candidate agents:\n\n*   **Numerator**:\n    β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (β₀): **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n*   **Sum of Denominator Terms**:\n    1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculation of Mole Fraction (α₂)**:\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ **0.16916**\n\n*   **Conversion to Percentage**:\n    Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\nThe calculation is robust and consistently yields approximately 16.9%. All candidate answers that show their work arrive at this numerical result.\n\n**3. Careful Points**\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The calculation relies on the assumption that the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, [SCN⁻], is approximately equal to its total initial concentration (0.1 M). This is a valid assumption because the total thiocyanate concentration is in ten-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction of it will be consumed to form complexes.\n*   **Inclusion of the Free Ion:** It is crucial to include the '1' in the denominator, which represents the fraction of free Co²⁺ ions relative to itself. All candidates correctly included this term.\n*   **Mapping to Multiple Choice Options:** The primary discrepancy among the candidate answers is not in the calculation itself, but in mapping the result (16.9%) to the correct lettered option. The provided options are A) 42.3%, B) 38.1%, C) 25.6%, and D) 16.9%. The calculated value of 16.9% clearly matches option D. Several candidate answers incorrectly selected A, B, or C despite performing the calculation correctly.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe methodology and the numerical calculation are consistently correct across all provided answers, leading to a result of 16.9%. This value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Chemical Species and Equilibria**\nThe solution contains free cobalt ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻). They form a series of complexes, and the total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**3. Formulate the Mathematical Expression**\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)ₙ]`, is denoted by `αₙ`. We are interested in `α₂`, the fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`. This fraction can be calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]). The formula is derived by expressing the concentration of each species in terms of `[Co²⁺]`, `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants, and then simplifying the ratio. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThis formula is correctly identified and used by all the candidate answers.\n\n**4. Check the Given Values and Assumptions**\n*   Stability constants: `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`\n*   Thiocyanate concentration: `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n*   Total cobalt concentration: `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`\n\nA key point is the assumption about the thiocyanate concentration. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the concentration of free thiocyanate at equilibrium is equal to its initial total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. This assumption is correctly made in the candidate solutions.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\nLet's verify the calculation performed by the agents.\n\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): `1`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n*   **Sum of Denominator Terms**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the fraction (α₂)**:\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThe calculation is robust and consistently yields approximately `16.9%`.\n\n**6. Match with the Options**\nThe calculated value is `16.9%`. Now we compare this to the options provided in the original question:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.

For the complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the formula is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified and used this formula. The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for this calculation as it cancels out.\n\n**3. Verify the Values Used**\nThe problem provides the following values:\n*   Concentration of thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constant β₁ = 9\n*   Stability constant β₂ = 40\n*   Stability constant β₃ = 63\n*   Stability constant β₄ = 16\n\nA key assumption, correctly made by all candidates, is that since the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the equilibrium concentration of free thiocyanate `[SCN⁻]` can be approximated as 0.1 M.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nLet's calculate the numerator and the denominator of the fraction α₂.\n\n*   **Numerator**:\n    `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Denominator**: This is the sum of all terms from the free ion (term = 1) to the final complex.\n    *   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of Denominator Terms**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the Fraction (α₂)**:\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Conclude**\nThe calculated value is approximately **16.9%**. This matches option A.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the numerical result of 16.9%. However, several of them incorrectly mapped this result to the final multiple-choice letter. For example, Answer 1 calculated 16.9% but concluded `<<<D>>>`. This is an internal inconsistency. The agents that were internally consistent (where the calculated number matched the chosen option) all selected option A.\n\nBased on a correct and verified calculation, the percentage is 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the problem is required, paying close attention to the methodology and calculations presented by the candidate agents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Governing Equation:** The percentage of any given complex in such a system is determined by its mole fraction (αₙ). The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species (where n=2) is calculated using the concentrations of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]) and the overall stability constants (βₙ). The formula, which is correctly identified by all candidate answers, is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    The percentage is then `α₂ * 100`.\n\n3.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   Concentration of thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constant β₁ = 9\n    *   Stability constant β₂ = 40\n    *   Stability constant β₃ = 63\n    *   Stability constant β₄ = 16\n\n4.  **Address Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Ligand Concentration:** The total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M). This means the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, it is a valid and standard chemical assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, with the total initial concentration, 0.1 M. All candidate answers correctly apply this assumption.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The formula for the mole fraction (α₂) shows that the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out. Consequently, the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not needed for the calculation of the *percentage distribution* of the species.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Numerator:** The term for the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`.\n        Numerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator:** This is the sum of the terms for all possible species (including the free ion, for which the term is 1).\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Convert to Percentage:**\n        Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Decide:**\n    The calculated value is approximately **16.9%**. The provided options are:\n    *   A) 25.6%\n    *   B) 42.3%\n    *   C) 38.1%\n    *   D) 16.9%\n\n    The calculated result matches option D. While nearly all candidate answers performed the calculation correctly, several made errors in mapping their correct result to the correct letter option. The correct calculation leads unequivocally to 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Chemical Species and Data**\n*   **Cobalt-containing species**: Co²⁺ (free ion), [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n*   **Total cobalt concentration**: c(Co) = 10⁻² M.\n*   **Thiocyanate concentration**: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n*   **Overall stability constants**: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation Strategy**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, denoted as α₂, can be calculated using a formula that relates the concentrations of all species through the stability constants.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the stability constants, we can express each complex's concentration in terms of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe mole fraction α₂ is the ratio of the concentration of `[Co(SCN)₂]` to the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstituting the expressions, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The problem provides the total thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. Since this is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M), the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, as 0.1 M. This is a standard and valid assumption for this type of problem.\n\n*   **Calculate the numerator**:\n    Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n*   **Calculate the terms in the denominator**:\n    *   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n\n*   **Sum the denominator**:\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n*   **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂)**:\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to percentage**:\n    Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n**5.
