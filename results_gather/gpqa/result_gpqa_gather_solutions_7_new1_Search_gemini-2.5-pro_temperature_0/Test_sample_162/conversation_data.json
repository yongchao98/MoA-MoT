The most rigorous method is to check which of the provided options satisfies the principle of mass balance for the hydrogen ions (H⁺).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be Dissolved:**\n    *   First, find the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n        *   M(Fe) ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n        *   M(O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n        *   M(H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n    *   Next, calculate the moles in the 0.1 g sample.\n        *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ **0.0009356 mol**.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Hydrogen Ion (H⁺) Balance Equation:**\n    The total amount of H⁺ added from the strong acid must be accounted for in two ways:\n    *   **H⁺ that reacts:** The acid reacts with Fe(OH)₃ according to the stoichiometry:\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n        Moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n    *   **H⁺ that remains:** An excess of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution to keep it acidic and prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating. This excess determines the final pH.\n        Moles of H⁺ remaining = Final [H⁺] × Total Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L.\n\n    The governing equation is:\n    **Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ Remaining**\n\n3.  **Test the Options for Self-Consistency:**\n    We will check each option to see if the volume of acid provided supplies the correct total moles of H⁺ needed to both react and achieve the given pH.\n\n    *   **Total Moles H⁺ Added** = (Volume in cm³ / 1000) × 0.1 M\n\n    **A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   H⁺ Added = (32.14 / 1000) * 0.1 = 0.003214 mol.\n    *   H⁺ Needed = 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ * 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n    *   0.003214 ≠ 0.002876. **Inconsistent.**\n\n    **B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   H⁺ Added = (28.05 / 1000) * 0.1 = 0.002805 mol.\n    *   H⁺ Needed = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁰⁴ * 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\n    *   0.002805 ≠ 0.003719. **Inconsistent.** (Note: The amount of acid added is barely enough to react, leaving no excess to create such a low pH).\n\n    **C) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   H⁺ Added = (30.09 / 1000) * 0.1 = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ Needed = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ * 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   The amount of H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the amount needed (0.003011 mol). The minor difference is due to rounding. **This option is self-consistent.**\n\n    **D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   H⁺ Added = (20.40 / 1000) * 0.1 = 0.002040 mol.\n    *   This amount is less than the 0.002807 mol required just for the reaction. **Impossible.**\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly option C provides a pair of values for the acid volume and final pH that are chemically and mathematically consistent. The volume of 30.09 cm³ is sufficient to both neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to create a final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the volume of acid and the final pH are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other. The most robust method is to use the principle of mass balance for the hydrogen ions (H⁺).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be Dissolved:**\n    *   First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃. Using the atomic masses (Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol, O ≈ 16.00 g/mol, H ≈ 1.01 g/mol):\n        Molar Mass = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n    *   Next, we find the moles in the 0.1 g sample:\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ **0.0009356 mol**.\n\n2.  **Understand the Role of the Acid:**\n    The strong acid (H⁺) added serves two purposes:\n    a.  **Reaction:** It reacts with the Fe(OH)₃ in a 3:1 molar ratio.\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    b.  **Excess:** It provides excess H⁺ ions that remain in the final 100 cm³ solution, establishing the final acidic pH.\n\n3.  **Set up the Mass Balance Equation:**\n    The total amount of H⁺ added must equal the amount that reacted plus the amount that remains in excess.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (reacted)** = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (remaining)** = Final [H⁺] × Total Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L.\n    *   **Total Moles H⁺ (added)** = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining).\n    *   The volume of 0.1 M acid required to supply this total amount is:\n        Volume (cm³) = (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M) × 1000.\n\n4.  **Test the Options for Self-Consistency:**\n    We will now check which option's (pH, Volume) pair satisfies the mass balance equation.\n\n    *   **Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n        *   Total H⁺ added from this volume = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\n        *   This amount is less than the 0.002807 mol required just for the reaction, so it's impossible to also have excess H⁺ to reach a pH of 2.04. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n        *   Let's calculate the total H⁺ needed to achieve this state.\n        *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) for pH 2.69 = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol.\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ (needed) = 0.002807 mol (reacted) + 0.000204 mol (remaining) = **0.003011 mol**.\n        *   Now, let's see how much H⁺ is supplied by the given volume.\n        *   Total H⁺ (supplied) = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n        *   The amount of acid needed (0.003011 mol) and the amount supplied (0.003009 mol) are virtually identical. This option is self-consistent.\n\n    *   **Option C: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n        *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) for pH 3.16 = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol.\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ (needed) = 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = 0.002876 mol.\n        *   Total H⁺ (supplied) = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = 0.003214 mol.\n        *   The amount needed (0.002876 mol) does not match the amount supplied (0.003214 mol). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n        *   Total H⁺ added from this volume = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = 0.002040 mol.\n        *   This amount is far less than the 0.002807 mol required for the reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only pair of values where the volume of acid is consistent with the amount needed to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires us to find a self-consistent pair of values: the volume of acid needed and the resulting pH. The most reliable way to solve this is to use the principle of mass balance for the hydrogen ions (H⁺) and check which of the given options satisfies this balance.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Calculate Moles for Reaction:** First, calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 g. Then, using the reaction stoichiometry `Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O`, determine the moles of H⁺ strictly required to react with this amount of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Formulate Mass Balance Equation:** The total amount of H⁺ added from the acid must be equal to the sum of two parts: the H⁺ that reacted with Fe(OH)₃ and the H⁺ that remains in the final 100 cm³ solution, which determines its pH.\n    *   `Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ Remaining`\n3.  **Test Each Option:** For each option (A, B, C, D), we will use the provided pH and volume to see if they satisfy the mass balance equation.\n    *   Calculate the \"Total Moles H⁺ Added\" from the given volume of 0.1 M acid.\n    *   Calculate the \"Moles H⁺ Remaining\" from the given pH in the 100 cm³ final volume.\n    *   Check if `(Total Moles H⁺ Added) ≈ (Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ Remaining)`.\n4.  **Identify Correct Answer:** The option for which both sides of the equation are nearly equal is the correct, self-consistent answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_consistent_option():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the required acid volume and resulting pH to dissolve Fe(OH)3\n    by checking which of the provided options is self-consistent.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Constants and Initial Calculations ---\n    mass_feoh3 = 0.1  # g\n    total_volume_L = 0.1  # L (100 cm^3)\n    acid_concentration = 0.1  # M\n\n    # Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3 (g/mol)\n    molar_mass_feoh3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008)  # 106.866 g/mol\n\n    # Moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved\n    moles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / molar_mass_feoh3\n\n    # Moles of H+ needed to react with Fe(OH)3 based on stoichiometry (Fe(OH)3 + 3H+)\n    moles_h_reacted = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\n    print(f\"Stoichiometric moles of H+ required for reaction: {moles_h_reacted:.6f} mol\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Options from the problem ---\n    options = {\n        'A': {'pH': 2.69, 'volume_cm3': 30.09},\n        'B': {'pH': 2.04, 'volume_cm3': 28.05},\n        'C': {'pH': 4.94, 'volume_cm3': 20.40},\n        'D': {'pH': 3.16, 'volume_cm3': 32.14},\n    }\n\n    best_option = None\n    min_error = float('inf')\n\n    # --- Test each option for self-consistency ---\n    for key, values in options.items():\n        ph = values['pH']\n        volume_L = values['volume_cm3'] / 1000.0\n\n        # Calculate the total moles of H+ supplied by the acid in this option\n        total_moles_h_supplied = acid_concentration * volume_L\n\n        # Calculate the moles of H+ that would remain in the solution for the given pH\n        moles_h_remaining = (10**(-ph)) * total_volume_L\n\n        # Calculate the total moles of H+ required according to the mass balance principle\n        total_moles_h_required = moles_h_reacted + moles_h_remaining\n\n        # Compare the supplied H+ with the required H+\n        error = abs(total_moles_h_supplied - total_moles_h_required)\n\n        print(f\"Testing Option {key}: pH={ph}, Volume={values['volume_cm3']} cm3\")\n        print(f\"  - H+ supplied by acid: {total_moles_h_supplied:.6f} mol\")\n        print(f\"  - H+ required (for reaction + final pH): {total_moles_h_required:.6f} mol\")\n        print(f\"  - Difference (error): {error:.6f}\")\n\n        if error < min_error:\n            min_error = error\n            best_option = key\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The most self-consistent option is {best_option}.\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: pH {options[best_option]['pH']}; {options[best_option]['volume_cm3']} cm3\")\n    \n    # Print the final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{best_option}>>>\")\n\nfind_consistent_option()\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Stoichiometric moles of H+ required for reaction: 0.002807 mol\n------------------------------\nTesting Option A: pH=2.69, Volume=30.09 cm3\n  - H+ supplied by acid: 0.003009 mol\n  - H+ required (for reaction + final pH): 0.003011 mol\n  - Difference (error): 0.000002\nTesting Option B: pH=2.04, Volume=28.05 cm3\n  - H+ supplied by acid: 0.002805 mol\n  - H+ required (for reaction + final pH): 0.003719 mol\n  - Difference (error): 0.000914\nTesting Option C: pH=4.94, Volume=20.4 cm3\n  - H+ supplied by acid: 0.002040 mol\n  - H+ required (for reaction + final pH): 0.002808 mol\n  - Difference (error): 0.000768\nTesting Option D: pH=3.16, Volume=32.14 cm3\n  - H+ supplied by acid: 0.003214 mol\n  - H+ required (for reaction + final pH): 0.002876 mol\n  - Difference (error): 0.000338\n------------------------------\nThe most self-consistent option is A.\nFinal Answer: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3\n\n<<<A>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Chemical Process**\n\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, we must add a strong acid. The acid (H⁺) serves two functions:\n*   **Reaction:** It reacts stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃ to convert it into soluble Fe³⁺ ions.\n*   **Equilibrium:** It provides an excess of H⁺ ions that remain in the final solution, keeping the pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = M(Fe) + 3 × M(O) + 3 × M(H)\n    *   M(Fe) ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n    *   M(O) ≈ 15.999 g/mol\n    *   M(H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass ≈ 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol\n\n**3. Formulate the Mass Balance Equation for H⁺**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the sum of the H⁺ that reacts and the H⁺ that remains in the final solution.\n\nTotal Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ Remaining\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Reacted:** From the 1:3 stoichiometry of the reaction, this is:\n    *   Moles H⁺ Reacted = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.0028073 mol\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining:** This is determined by the final pH of the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution.\n    *   Moles H⁺ Remaining = [H⁺]final × V_total = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** This comes from the volume of the 0.1 M acid.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ Added = C_acid × V_acid = 0.1 M × V_acid (in L)\n\nCombining these gives the governing equation:\n**0.1 × V_acid (L) = 0.0028073 + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1)**\n\n**4. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nThe correct answer must be the pair of (pH, Volume) that satisfies the equation above. We will test each option.\n\n*   **A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**\n    *   **H⁺ Used (Reacted + Remaining):** 0.0028073 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = 0.0028073 + (0.002042 × 0.1) = 0.0028073 + 0.0002042 = **0.0030115 mol**\n    *   **Conclusion:** The amount of H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is extremely close to the amount required (0.0030115 mol). The tiny difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding. **This option is self-consistent.**\n\n*   **B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**\n    *   **H⁺ Used (Reacted + Remaining):** 0.0028073 + (10⁻².⁰⁴ × 0.1) = 0.0028073 + (0.00912 × 0.1) = 0.0028073 + 0.000912 = **0.0037193 mol**\n    *   **Conclusion:** The values are not close. This option is not consistent.\n\n*   **C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**\n    *   **H⁺ Used (Reacted + Remaining):** 0.0028073 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) = 0.0028073 + (0.000692 × 0.1) = 0.0028073 + 0.0000692 = **0.0028765 mol**\n    *   **Conclusion:** The values are not close. This option is not consistent.\n\n*   **D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**\n    *   **Conclusion:** The amount of acid added (0.002040 mol) is less than the amount required just for the reaction (0.0028073 mol). This is physically impossible.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOnly option A provides a pair of values for volume and pH that are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Chemistry**\n\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, we need to add a strong acid. The total amount of acid added must accomplish two things:\n*   **React Stoichiometrically:** Provide enough H⁺ ions to react with all the Fe(OH)₃ according to the equation:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Provide Excess:** Leave a certain amount of unreacted H⁺ ions in the final solution. This excess of H⁺ determines the final pH and is necessary to keep the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out of the solution.\n\nThe correct answer must be a self-consistent pair of (Volume, pH) values that satisfies this mass balance.\n\n**2.

Understand the Core Chemical Principles**\n\nThis problem involves two key concepts that must be satisfied simultaneously:\n*   **Stoichiometry:** A specific amount of strong acid (H⁺) is required to react with and neutralize the 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃).\n*   **Equilibrium:** An additional amount of *excess* acid must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to keep the pH low enough to prevent the dissolved iron(III) ions (Fe³⁺) from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe total amount of acid added must account for both the acid that reacts and the acid that remains in excess. The most reliable way to solve this problem is to check which of the given options is self-consistent with this principle.\n\n**2.

The ratio is 1:3.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nWe will now check each option to see if the volume of acid provided is sufficient to both react with the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to achieve the given pH.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n**Total H⁺ Added = H⁺ Reacted + H⁺ Remaining**\n\nLet's test **Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Calculate Total H⁺ Added** from the given volume:\n    *   Volume of acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n*   **Calculate H⁺ Accounted For** (Reacted + Remaining):\n    *   H⁺ Reacted = **0.002807 mol** (from Step 2).\n    *   H⁺ Remaining is calculated from the given pH in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) volume:\n        *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n        *   Moles H⁺ Remaining = [H⁺] × Final Volume = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol.\n    *   Total H⁺ Accounted For = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n\n*   **Compare:** The `Total H⁺ Added` (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the `Total H⁺ Accounted For` (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding.

This option is inconsistent. In fact, the amount of acid added is barely enough to react with the Fe(OH)₃, leaving almost no excess to lower the pH to 2.04.\n\nThe other options are also inconsistent. Therefore, the only option that correctly balances the stoichiometry and equilibrium requirements is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the volume of acid and the final pH are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other.

This option is self-consistent.\n\n    *   **Test Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n        *   Volume of acid = 28.05 cm³ = 0.02805 L.\n        *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n        *   Total H⁺ required = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁰⁴ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + (0.00912 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = **0.003719 mol**.\n        *   The amount of acid added (0.002805 mol) is far less than the amount required (0.003719 mol). In fact, the amount of acid added is not even enough to complete the initial reaction (which requires 0.002807 mol), meaning not all the Fe(OH)₃ would dissolve. This option is physically impossible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only option that is chemically and mathematically self-consistent is the pair with a pH of 2.69 and a volume of 30.09 cm³.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe problem asks for the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in a final volume of 100 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution.

    "Based on the analysis of the provided answers, the correct solution can be determined by a systematic step-by-step process that verifies the chemical and mathematical consistency of the given options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core principle to solve this problem is the mass balance of the hydrogen ions (H⁺). The total amount of acid added must be sufficient for two purposes:\n1.  **Reaction:** To react stoichiometrically with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Excess:** To provide an excess of H⁺ ions that remain in the final 100 cm³ solution, which establishes the final pH.\n\nThe correct option must satisfy the following equation:\n**Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Moles of H⁺ Reacted + Moles of H⁺ Remaining**\n\n**1. Calculate Moles of H⁺ Needed for Reaction**\n*   First, calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃. Using atomic masses (Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol, O ≈ 16.00 g/mol, H ≈ 1.01 g/mol):\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Next, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample:\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n*   The balanced chemical equation is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\n*   From the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction are:\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**2. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\nNow, we will check which of the provided options (A, B, C, D) is self-consistent.\n\n*   **Option A: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = 0.002040 mol.\n    *   This amount (0.002040 mol) is less than the amount required just for the reaction (0.002807 mol). Therefore, this option is physically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\n    *   This amount is also slightly less than what is required for the reaction (0.002807 mol), so it is impossible to dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃, let alone have an excess of acid to lower the pH to 2.04.\n\n*   **Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ required = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   H⁺ required = 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   The amount added (0.003214 mol) does not match the amount required (0.002876 mol). This option is inconsistent.\n\n*   **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ required = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   H⁺ required = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   The amount of H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the amount required (0.003011 mol). The minor difference is due to rounding. This option is self-consistent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly identify the scientific method for solving the problem. They unanimously conclude, through calculation, that the pair of values `pH 2.69` and `30.09 cm³` is the only self-consistent solution. The confusion in the final lettered answers (`<<<A>>>`, `<<<C>>>`, etc.) arises because the agents re-ordered the options internally.\n\nBased on the original question's list of options, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Understand the Core Chemical Process**\n\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, we must add a strong acid. The acid (H⁺) serves two functions:\n*   **Reaction:** It reacts stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃ to convert it into soluble Fe³⁺ ions.\n*   **Equilibrium:** It provides an excess of H⁺ ions that remain in the final solution, keeping the pH low enough to prevent the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = M(Fe) + 3 × M(O) + 3 × M(H)\n    *   M(Fe) ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n    *   M(O) ≈ 15.999 g/mol\n    *   M(H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass ≈ 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol\n\n**3. Formulate the Mass Balance Equation for H⁺**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the sum of the H⁺ that reacts and the H⁺ that remains in the final solution.\n\nTotal Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ Remaining\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Reacted:** From the 1:3 stoichiometry of the reaction, this is:\n    *   Moles H⁺ Reacted = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.0028073 mol\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining:** This is determined by the final pH of the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution.\n    *   Moles H⁺ Remaining = [H⁺]final × V_total = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:** This comes from the volume of the 0.1 M acid.\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ Added = C_acid × V_acid = 0.1 M × V_acid (in L)\n\nCombining these gives the governing equation:\n**0.1 × V_acid (L) = 0.0028073 + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1)**\n\n**4.

This is impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × (32.14 / 1000) L = 0.003214 mol\n    *   Moles H⁺ Remaining = 10⁻³·¹⁶ M × 0.1 L = 0.000069 mol\n    *   Total H⁺ Needed = 0.002807 (reacted) + 0.000069 (remaining) = 0.002876 mol\n    *   *Inconsistent:* 0.003214 mol added ≠ 0.002876 mol needed.\n\n*   **Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Moles H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × (30.09 / 1000) L = **0.003009 mol**\n    *   Moles H⁺ Remaining = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol\n    *   Total H⁺ Needed = 0.002807 (reacted) + 0.000204 (remaining) = **0.003011 mol**\n    *   **Consistent:** The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the total amount needed (0.003011 mol). The minor difference is due to rounding in the problem's values.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the values in option D are chemically and mathematically self-consistent. The volume of acid (30.09 cm³) is sufficient to both neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to produce a final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the given options.\n\n### Core Principle: Mass Balance of Hydrogen Ions (H⁺)\n\nThe most reliable way to solve this problem is to check which of the given (pH, Volume) pairs is self-consistent. The total amount of H⁺ ions added from the acid must be accounted for. These ions are used for two purposes:\n1.  **Reacting with Fe(OH)₃:** A specific amount of H⁺ is consumed stoichiometrically to dissolve the solid.\n2.  **Remaining in Solution:** A certain amount of excess H⁺ must remain in the final solution to establish the final pH.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n**Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Moles of H⁺ Reacted + Moles of H⁺ Remaining**\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Needed for Reaction\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved and then the moles of H⁺ required to react with it.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n    *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n    *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Reacted:**\n    *   The reaction is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l).\n    *   The stoichiometry is 1:3, so:\n    *   Moles H⁺ Reacted = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Test Each Option for Self-Consistency\n\nNow we test each option to see if the amount of acid added matches the amount required.\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added** = Acid Concentration × Acid Volume = 0.1 M × V_acid (L)\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining** = Final [H⁺] × Total Volume = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L\n\n**A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added = 0.1 × 0.03214 = 0.003214 mol.\n*   H⁺ Required = 0.002807 (reacted) + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) (remaining) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n*   `0.003214 ≠ 0.002876`. **Inconsistent.**\n\n**B) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added = 0.1 × 0.02040 = 0.002040 mol.\n*   This is less than the 0.002807 mol required just to react with the Fe(OH)₃. It is impossible to dissolve the solid with this amount of acid. **Inconsistent.**\n\n**C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added = 0.1 × 0.02805 = 0.002805 mol.\n*   H⁺ Required = 0.002807 (reacted) + (10⁻².⁰⁴ × 0.1) (remaining) = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\n*   `0.002805 ≠ 0.003719`. **Inconsistent.**\n\n**D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added = 0.1 × 0.03009 = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   H⁺ Required = 0.002807 (reacted) + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) (remaining) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   `0.003009 ≈ 0.003011`. **Consistent.** The values are nearly identical, with the small difference attributable to rounding in the problem's given values.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only option where the volume of acid added is consistent with the amount needed to both dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given pH is option D. The alternative method of calculating the stoichiometric volume and then the pH from hydrolysis is flawed because it ignores the contribution of the excess acid to the final pH.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the given options.\n\n**1. Fundamental Principle: Mass Balance of Hydrogen Ions (H⁺)**\n\nThe most reliable way to solve this problem is to find the option where the amount of acid added is consistent with the amount needed for both the reaction and to establish the final pH. The total moles of H⁺ added must equal the sum of the moles of H⁺ that react with Fe(OH)₃ and the moles of H⁺ that remain in the solution to create the final pH.\n\n*   **Equation:** `Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ Remaining`\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Needed for the Reaction**\n\nThis is a fixed value based on the initial amount of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   **Step 2a: Find the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.**\n    *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n    *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n    *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Find the moles of Fe(OH)₃.**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n\n*   **Step 2c: Find the moles of H⁺ that react.**\n    *   The reaction is: `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n    *   The stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles H⁺ Reacted = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3.

The calculated total moles of H⁺ needed (0.003011 mol) is almost identical to the moles of H⁺ supplied by the given volume (0.003009 mol). The minor difference is due to rounding in the problem's values.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Chemical Principles**\n\nThis problem involves two key concepts that must be satisfied simultaneously:\n*   **Stoichiometry:** A specific amount of strong acid (H⁺) is required to react with and neutralize the 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃).\n*   **Equilibrium:** An additional amount of *excess* acid must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to keep the pH low enough to prevent the dissolved iron(III) ions (Fe³⁺) from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe total amount of acid added must account for both the acid that reacts and the acid that remains in excess. The most reliable way to solve this problem is to check which of the given options is self-consistent with this principle.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃ and the H⁺ Needed for Reaction**\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n    *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n    *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** The balanced chemical equation is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`. The ratio is 1:3.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nWe will now check each option to see if the volume of acid provided is sufficient to both react with the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to achieve the given pH.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n**Total H⁺ Added = H⁺ Reacted + H⁺ Remaining**\n\nLet's test **Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Calculate Total H⁺ Added** from the given volume:\n    *   Volume of acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n*   **Calculate H⁺ Accounted For** (Reacted + Remaining):\n    *   H⁺ Reacted = **0.002807 mol** (from Step 2).\n    *   H⁺ Remaining is calculated from the given pH in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) volume:\n        *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n        *   Moles H⁺ Remaining = [H⁺] × Final Volume = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol.\n    *   Total H⁺ Accounted For = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n\n*   **Compare:** The `Total H⁺ Added` (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the `Total H⁺ Accounted For` (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding. This option is self-consistent.\n\nLet's quickly check another option for comparison.\n\nTest **Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n\n*   **Calculate Total H⁺ Added**:\n    *   Volume = 28.05 cm³ = 0.02805 L\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   **Calculate H⁺ Accounted For**:\n    *   H⁺ Reacted = **0.002807 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ Remaining (at pH 2.04): [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.00912 M.

This option is inconsistent. In fact, the amount of acid added is barely enough to react with the Fe(OH)₃, leaving almost no excess to lower the pH to 2.04.\n\nThe other options are also inconsistent. Therefore, the only option that correctly balances the stoichiometry and equilibrium requirements is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the option where the volume of acid and the final pH are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other. The most robust method is to check if the total amount of acid added accounts for both the acid consumed in the reaction and the acid remaining that sets the final pH.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃. Using atomic masses (Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol, O ≈ 16.00 g/mol, H ≈ 1.01 g/mol), the molar mass is 106.88 g/mol.\n    *   Next, we find the moles in the 0.1 g sample:\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stoichiometry:**\n    The balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (H⁺) is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This shows that 3 moles of H⁺ are consumed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved.\n\n3.  **Establish the Mass Balance Equation:**\n    The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the sum of the moles that react and the moles that remain in the final solution.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (reacted):** 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (remaining):** This sets the final pH in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution. Moles = Concentration × Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L.\n    *   **Total Moles H⁺ (added):** This is provided by the acid. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × V_acid (in L).\n\n    The governing equation is:\n    **0.1 × V_acid = 0.002807 + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1)**\n\n4.  **Test the Options for Self-Consistency:**\n    We will now check which of the given pairs of (pH, Volume) satisfies this equation.\n\n    *   **Test Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n        *   Volume of acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L.\n        *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n        *   Total H⁺ required = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + (0.002042 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = **0.003011 mol**.\n        *   The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the amount required (0.003011 mol). This option is self-consistent.\n\n    *   **Test Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n        *   Volume of acid = 28.05 cm³ = 0.02805 L.\n        *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n        *   Total H⁺ required = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁰⁴ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + (0.00912 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = **0.003719 mol**.\n        *   The amount of acid added (0.002805 mol) is far less than the amount required (0.003719 mol). In fact, the amount of acid added is not even enough to complete the initial reaction (which requires 0.002807 mol), meaning not all the Fe(OH)₃ would dissolve. This option is physically impossible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only option that is chemically and mathematically self-consistent is the pair with a pH of 2.69 and a volume of 30.09 cm³.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe problem asks for the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in a final volume of 100 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution. This requires finding a self-consistent pair of values for volume and pH.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\n    *   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated from the atomic masses: Fe (≈55.85 g/mol), O (≈16.00 g/mol), H (≈1.01 g/mol).\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Hydrogen Ion (H⁺) Balance.**\n    The total amount of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the sum of the H⁺ consumed in the reaction and the H⁺ remaining in the solution, which determines the final pH.\n    *   **H⁺ Consumed in Reaction:** The balanced equation is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`. The stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n        *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   **H⁺ Remaining in Solution (Excess):** This amount determines the final pH in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) total volume.\n        *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = Final [H⁺] × Total Volume = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L.\n    *   **Total H⁺ Added:** This is provided by the volume of the 0.1 M acid.\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ = Acid Concentration × Acid Volume = 0.1 M × V_acid (in L).\n\n3.  **Create the Governing Equation.**\n    The core relationship that must be satisfied is:\n    `Total H⁺ Added = H⁺ Reacted + H⁺ Excess`\n    `0.1 × V_acid = (2.807 × 10⁻³) + (10⁻pH × 0.1)`\n\n4.  **Test the Options for Self-Consistency.**\n    Since we have two unknowns (V_acid and pH), we must test the pairs given in the options to see which one satisfies the governing equation.\n\n    Let's test **Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   V_acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L.\n    *   **Left Side of Equation (Total H⁺ Added):**\n        *   0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   **Right Side of Equation (H⁺ Reacted + H⁺ Excess):**\n        *   H⁺ Reacted ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n        *   H⁺ Excess = 10⁻².⁶⁹ mol/L × 0.1 L ≈ (2.042 x 10⁻³) × 0.1 = 0.0002042 mol.\n        *   Total on Right Side = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = **0.0030112 mol**.\n\n    The value from the left side (0.003009 mol) is extremely close to the value from the right side (0.0030112 mol). The minor difference is due to rounding of constants. This demonstrates that this pair of values is chemically and mathematically consistent.\n\n    Testing the other options reveals significant inconsistencies. For example, for Option A (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³):\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\n    *   H⁺ Reacted + H⁺ Excess = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁰⁴ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\n    *   These values (0.002805 mol and 0.003719 mol) are not consistent.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only option that provides a self-consistent set of values for the acid volume and the resulting pH is Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find a pair of values for acid volume and final pH that are chemically and mathematically consistent with each other. The most robust method is to perform a mass balance on the hydrogen ions (H⁺).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be Dissolved**\n    *   First, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n        *   Molar Mass (Fe) ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass (H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n    *   Next, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n2.  **Understand the Role of the Acid**\n    The strong acid provides H⁺ ions that perform two functions:\n    a.  **React with Fe(OH)₃:** A specific amount of H⁺ is consumed in the neutralization reaction.\n    b.  **Establish Final pH:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to keep it acidic and prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mass Balance Equation**\n    The total amount of H⁺ added must equal the sum of the H⁺ that reacts and the H⁺ that remains.\n    *   **H⁺ Reacted:** The reaction is Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l). From the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction are:\n        *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   **H⁺ Remaining:** This is determined by the final pH in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution.\n        *   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺]final × Total Volume = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L.\n    *   **Total H⁺ Added:** This comes from the volume of the 0.1 M acid.\n        *   Total H⁺ Added = Acid Concentration × Acid Volume = 0.1 M × V_acid (in L).\n\n    The governing equation is: **(0.1 × V_acid) = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1)**\n\n4.  **Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n    We will now check which of the given (pH, Volume) pairs satisfies our mass balance equation.\n\n    *   **A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n        *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\n        *   This amount is less than the 0.002807 mol required just for the reaction. This option is physically impossible.\n\n    *   **B) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n        *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = 0.002040 mol.\n        *   This amount is also less than what is required for the reaction. This option is impossible.\n\n    *   **C) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n        *   Left Side (Total H⁺ Added) = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n        *   Right Side (H⁺ Reacted + H⁺ Remaining) = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + (0.002042 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = **0.003011 mol**.\n        *   The two values are virtually identical (0.003009 ≈ 0.003011). The minor difference is due to rounding. This option is self-consistent.\n\n    *   **D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n        *   Left Side (Total H⁺ Added) = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = 0.003214 mol.\n        *   Right Side (H⁺ Reacted + H⁺ Remaining) = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + (0.000692 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n        *   The values are not consistent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only option that provides a chemically and mathematically consistent pair of values for the acid volume and the resulting pH is C. The volume of acid (30.09 cm³) is sufficient to both neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to create a final solution with a pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
