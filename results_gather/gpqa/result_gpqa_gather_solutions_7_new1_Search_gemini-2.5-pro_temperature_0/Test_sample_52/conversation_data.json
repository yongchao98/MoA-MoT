The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H12O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Identify Molecular Fragments from Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, giving a core fragment of **C₆H₄**. The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which is characteristic of a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and contains one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Second Methyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups.\" One is in the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester functionality.\n    *   **No –CH₂ Groups:** This is a critical constraint. To form an ester with a methyl group without introducing a -CH₂- group (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the fragment must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    We combine the identified fragments to find the total atom count:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Summing the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   **From Structure:** The structure contains a benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation), one C=C double bond (1 degree), and one C=O double bond (1 degree). Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n    *   **From Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2)`. For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, this is `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n    *   The DoU values match, confirming the formula is correct.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Let's check the options:\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n\n    The calculated formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** matches option B. The other options are incorrect because they either have the wrong number of atoms or would require the presence of -CH₂- groups (C₁₂H₁₄O₂), which are explicitly absent according to the NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe core of the problem is to translate the spectroscopic data into structural fragments and then assemble them to find the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The base fragment is **C₆H₄**. The 1H NMR data, showing only two signals for these four protons, strongly suggests a symmetrical 1,4- (para) substitution pattern.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which contains one carbonyl (C=O) and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**. It accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups.\n*   **1H NMR shows two -CH₃ group signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **1H NMR shows no -CH₂ group signals:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any other type that includes a methylene (-CH₂-) bridge. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OOCCH₃**). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall formula:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester/methyl fragment) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester/methyl fragment) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n*   The DoU values match, confirming the derived formula is consistent with the structure.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options and Final Decision\n\nThe derived formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. We now compare this to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (DoU = 5, incorrect)\n*   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DoU = 6, but contains an extra CH₂, which is ruled out by NMR)\n*   C) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** (DoU = 6, matches our derivation)\n*   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (DoU = 7, incorrect)\n\nThe analysis consistently and unambiguously points to **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** as the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic data. This corresponds to option C. The majority of the candidate answers reached this same conclusion in their reasoning, even if some made errors in matching the formula to the correct letter option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided answers to determine the final, correct choice.\n\nMy plan is to first independently verify the chemical formula by breaking down the spectroscopic data into molecular fragments. Then, I will sum the atoms of these fragments to derive the formula. Finally, I will write a Python script to automate this calculation and compare the result against the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Analysis:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic hydrogens. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n\n2.  **FTIR and Ester Analysis:** The FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-), which accounts for **2 oxygen atoms**. The ¹H NMR shows two -CH₃ signals and, crucially, **no -CH₂ signals**. One -CH₃ signal must belong to the ester. To have an ester with a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n3.  **Vinyl and Second Methyl Group Analysis:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and the second -CH₃ signal. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Formula:** By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The derived molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. Now, I will use the Python code to confirm this and select the correct option from the list.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the chemical formula based on spectroscopic data fragments\n    and selects the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecular fragments based on the spectroscopic data.\n    # Aromatic ring: Di-substituted with 2 H signals -> para-substituted C6H4\n    ring = {'C': 6, 'H': 4, 'O': 0}\n    \n    # Vinyl group: Doublet and doublet of quartets -> propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)\n    propenyl_group = {'C': 3, 'H': 5, 'O': 0}\n    \n    # Ester group: Contains the second -CH3 and no -CH2- groups -> methyl ester or acetate\n    # e.g., -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3.

Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) from the Structural Information**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as Double Bond Equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, which accounts for **4 degrees of unsaturation**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-). The carbonyl (C=O) bond in the ester accounts for **1 degree of unsaturation**.\n*   **Vinyl-H Signals:** The presence of vinyl protons in the 1H NMR spectrum indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for **1 degree of unsaturation**.\n\nAdding these together, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\n**2. Calculate the DoU for Each of the Given Chemical Formulas**\nThe formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (This matches our requirement).\n*   **B) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. (This also matches our requirement).\n*   **C) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = **7**. (This does not match).\n*   **D) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = **5**. (This does not match).\n\nBased on the DoU calculation, we can eliminate options C and D. The correct answer must be either A (C11H12O2) or B (C12H14O2).\n\n**3. Detailed Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify Fragments**\nWe need to use the detailed NMR data to distinguish between the remaining two options.\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4). This fragment is **C6H4**.\n*   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is **C3H5**.\n*   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** We have identified one -CH3 group in the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or any other ester with a methylene group. Therefore, the ester must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n**4. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula**\nLet's sum the atoms from the fragments we have identified:\n*   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   Propenyl group: C3H5\n*   Ester + methyl fragment: C2H3O2\n\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n\nThe chemical formula derived from a complete analysis of the spectroscopic data is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe derived formula C11H12O2 matches option A. The other remaining possibility, C12H14O2 (option B), would contain an additional CH2 group compared to our derived structure. The problem explicitly states there are no signals for -CH2- groups, which definitively rules out option B.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the given data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core of this fragment is C₆H₄.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl (C=O) bond.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates any structures containing methylene groups (e.g., ethyl, propyl chains).\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum to Identify Substituents:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution. This accounts for the C₆H₄ fragment and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH₃**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three methyl protons (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, resulting in a doublet (d).\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, which has the formula **C₃H₅**. This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** We have identified one methyl group in the propenyl substituent. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH₂ groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, it must be a methyl ester (–COOCH₃) or an acetate group (–OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n    *   **DoU from the candidate formulas:**\n        *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n        *   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6 (Plausible DoU, but requires a -CH₂- group, which is absent)\n        *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n        *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6** (Correct)\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data unambiguously leads to the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation and is the only option consistent with all the NMR signals, particularly the absence of any -CH₂- groups. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the task is to deduce a chemical formula from a combination of spectroscopic data (FTIR and ¹H NMR). The key pieces of information are:\n1.  A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\n2.  An ester group is present.\n3.  There are six signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n4.  Two signals are for aromatic protons.\n5.  Two signals are for vinyl protons (a doublet and a doublet of quartets).\n6.  Two signals are for methyl (-CH₃) groups.\n7.  There are **no** signals for methylene (-CH₂) groups.\n\n### Step-by-Step Deduction\n\n1.  **Identify Molecular Fragments:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted aromatic ring with two proton signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substituted benzene ring. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The specific splitting pattern of a doublet and a doublet of quartets for two vinyl protons is a classic signature of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH₃**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester (-COO-). The NMR shows a second methyl signal. The crucial constraint is the absence of any -CH₂- signals. This rules out common ester types like ethyl esters (-COOCH₂CH₃). The only way to have an ester and a methyl group without a methylene group is to have either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula:\n    *   From the aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   From the propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   From the ester/methyl fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU indicates the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   **From the structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**.\n    *   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    The DoU values match, confirming the formula is consistent with the structure.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n    *   **B) C11H14O2:** Incorrect hydrogen count and DoU (5). This would imply the absence of the vinyl C=C bond.\n    *   **C) C12H12O2:** Incorrect carbon count and DoU (7).\n    *   **D) C12H14O2:** Incorrect carbon and hydrogen count. This formula has an extra CH₂ group compared to the correct answer, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data consistently leads to the chemical formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This formula perfectly accounts for all the described signals and constraints, particularly the specific vinyl splitting pattern and the absence of -CH₂- groups. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe first step is to break down the information from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra to identify the key structural fragments of the molecule. This analysis was performed consistently and correctly by nearly all the provided answers.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core fragment is **C₆H₄**. The fact that there are only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **1H NMR - Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum shows two vinyl proton signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **1H NMR - Two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester.\n*   **1H NMR - No –CH₂ group signals:** This is a critical constraint. To have an ester with a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, the fragment must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate (**-OCOCH₃**). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\n\nThe next step is to combine the identified fragments and sum their atoms to find the molecular formula.\n\n*   Aromatic ring fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl group fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester and second methyl fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nA crucial check is to ensure the degree of unsaturation (number of rings + pi bonds) matches for both the formula and the structure.\n\n*   **DoU from the formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):**\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n*   **DoU from the structural fragments:**\n    Aromatic ring (1 ring, 3 double bonds) = 4\n    Vinyl C=C double bond = 1\n    Ester C=O double bond = 1\n    Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**\n\nThe DoU values match, confirming that **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** is the correct formula.\n\n### Step 4: Select the Final Answer\n\nThe final step is to match the derived formula with the given options.\n\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n*   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n*   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n*   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option D.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\nWhile almost all candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis to arrive at the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂, many failed to select the correct corresponding letter from the provided options. This appears to be due to confusion or using a different set of options. However, the scientific reasoning consistently and overwhelmingly supports C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The agents that correctly mapped this formula to the given options (e.g., Answers 4, 7, and 8) selected D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe core of the problem is to translate the spectroscopic data into structural fragments and then assemble them to find the molecular formula. All candidate answers correctly follow this process.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is identified as a C₆H₄ fragment. The presence of only two aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR strongly suggests a symmetrical 1,4- (para) substitution pattern.\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR data confirms a -COO- group, which contains one carbonyl (C=O) and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Vinyl group:** The ¹H NMR signals of a doublet and a doublet of quartets are unanimously and correctly identified as a characteristic pattern for a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH₃. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n*   **Methyl groups:** The ¹H NMR shows two distinct -CH₃ signals. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester.\n*   **No -CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or contain any other methylene bridge. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly part of the ester, as in a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃).\n\n### 2. Assembling the Fragments and Determining the Formula\n\nAll candidate answers correctly combine these fragments to deduce the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Ester + Methyl Group:** This combined fragment is C₂H₃O₂ (e.g., -COOCH₃).\n\nSumming the atoms from these fragments gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nA key verification step, used by many of the candidate answers, is to check the Degree of Unsaturation.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the potential formulas:**\n    *   C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. **(Matches)**\n    *   C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. **(Matches)**\n\nThis initial check eliminates two options, leaving C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\n### 4. Final Decision Point\n\nThe final distinction between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ relies on the \"no –CH₂ groups\" constraint. The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has one more carbon and two more hydrogens than C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to an additional -CH₂- group. Since the ¹H NMR spectrum explicitly shows no signals for -CH₂- groups, the formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ can be definitively ruled out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll fifteen candidate answers, through correct and consistent chemical reasoning, conclude that the molecular formula must be C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The analysis of the structural fragments derived from the NMR and FTIR data is unambiguous and points to this single result.\n\nThe provided options are:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. The core fragment is **C₆H₄**. The ¹H NMR shows two signals for the 4 aromatic protons, which strongly suggests a symmetrical 1,4- (para) substitution pattern.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and contains one C=C double bond.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal is part of the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows no signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other chain with a -CH₂- unit. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly part of the ester, forming either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate group (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    We combine the identified fragments to find the total number of atoms:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Summing these up:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU indicates the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\n    The values match, confirming the formula is consistent with the structure.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DoU = 6)\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (DoU = 7)\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (DoU = 6)\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (DoU = 5)\n\n    The DoU calculation eliminates options B and D. We are left with A and C.\n    Our detailed fragment analysis derived the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n    Option A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) differs from our derived formula by one CH₂ group. The problem explicitly states there are **no –CH₂ groups**, which definitively rules out option A.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the given options.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) from the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the double bond equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. We can deduce this from the structural information provided:\n*   **6-membered aromatic ring:** This accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n*   **Ester group (-COO-):** The carbonyl (C=O) bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\nAdding these together, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the DoU for Each Chemical Formula Option**\n\nThe formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **A) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**\n*   **D) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n\nBased on the DoU calculation, we can eliminate options A and B. The correct formula must be either C12H14O2 or C11H12O2.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Fragments to Build the Structure**\n\nWe can use the detailed NMR data to count the atoms and distinguish between the remaining two options.\n\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution. This fragment is **C6H4**.\n*   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n*   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One -CH3 signal is from the propenyl group. The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. To form an ester with a methyl group and no methylene (-CH2-) groups, the fragment must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   Propenyl group: C3H5\n*   Ester + methyl part: C2H3O2\n\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe formula derived from a detailed analysis of all spectroscopic data is C11H12O2. This matches the DoU of 6. The other remaining option, C12H14O2, has the correct DoU but contains an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**, which definitively rules out C12H14O2.\n\nTherefore, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula, considering all the provided information and identifying key points.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as Double Bond Equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. We can determine the required DoU from the structural information provided:\n*   **6-membered aromatic ring:** This accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring + three double bonds).\n*   **Ester group (-COO-):** The carbonyl (C=O) bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\nAdding these up, the total required DoU for the molecule is 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for each of the given options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n*   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n*   B) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6\n*   C) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6\n*   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\nThis initial analysis eliminates options A and D, as their DoU values do not match the required value of 6. The correct answer must be either B (C12H14O2) or C (C11H12O2).\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data to Identify Molecular Fragments**\n\nThis step is crucial to distinguish between the remaining two options.\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **-CH₃ groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group.\n*   **No -CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. For the ester to have a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, it must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OOCCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n**3. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the fragments we have confidently identified from the spectroscopic data:\n*   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + second methyl group: C₂H₃O₂\n\nNow, we sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe formula derived from a detailed analysis of all the spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This matches option C.\n\nLet's re-examine the other possibility from the DoU calculation, option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). To get from our derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ to C₁₂H₁₄O₂, one would need to add a CH₂ group. However, the problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Structural Information and Calculate the Required Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), or double bond equivalent, tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. We can determine the required DoU from the structural information given:\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** A benzene ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, so it accounts for **4 DoU**.\n*   **Ester group (-COO-):** The carbonyl (C=O) double bond in the ester group accounts for **1 DoU**.\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for **1 DoU**.\n\nAdding these together, the molecule must have a total DoU of 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\n**2. Calculate the DoU for Each of the Candidate Formulas**\n\nThe formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   A) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**\n*   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = **5**\n*   C) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n*   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = **7**\n\nBased on this calculation, we can eliminate options B (DoU=5) and D (DoU=7). The correct answer must be either A (C12H14O2) or C (C11H12O2).\n\n**3. Deduce the Molecular Fragments from the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe NMR data allows us to piece together the exact structure.\n\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is **C6H4**.\n*   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is **C3H5**.\n*   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** We have identified one -CH3 group in the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. To have an ester with a methyl group but no -CH2- group, the fragment must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n**4. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   Propenyl group: C3H5\n*   Ester/methyl fragment: C2H3O2\n\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe formula derived from the detailed spectroscopic analysis is C11H12O2. This matches option C. We can also definitively rule out option A (C12H14O2). To get from C11H12O2 to C12H14O2, one would need to add a -CH2- group. The NMR data explicitly states there are no signals for -CH2- groups, making C12H14O2 impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the raw data from FTIR and 1H NMR into structural pieces of the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Two aromatic-H signals:** For a di-substituted ring, having only two proton signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This accounts for 4 hydrogens.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl (C=O).\n*   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for a C=C double bond, two vinyl protons, and one methyl group. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal is from the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester.\n*   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other alkyl chain with a -CH₂- unit. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the overall chemical formula.\n\n*   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester + Methyl Group):** C₂H₃O₂\n\nLet's sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Formula with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also called double bond equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from the derived structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the calculated formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n\nThe DoU values match, which strongly supports the correctness of the derived formula.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options and Conclude\n\nThe derived chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. We now compare this to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n*   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n*   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n*   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n\nThe calculated formula matches option B. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** Has a DoU of 5. This would mean one of the double bonds (likely the vinyl C=C) is missing, which contradicts the NMR data.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** Has a DoU of 6, but contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the correct formula. The NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH₂- groups.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** Has a DoU of 7, which is inconsistent with the identified structural features.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Chemical Reasoning\nThe fundamental task is to deduce the molecular formula from spectroscopic data. The key pieces of information are:\n*   A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\n*   An ester group (-COO-).\n*   No methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n*   Specific ¹H NMR signals: two for aromatic-H, two for vinyl-H (a doublet and a doublet of quartets), and two for methyl (-CH3) groups.\n\n### Step 2: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\nA consistent line of reasoning is present in nearly all the candidate answers:\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted aromatic ring with two proton signals implies a symmetrical, para-substituted `C6H4` fragment. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n2.  **Vinyl Group:** The specific splitting pattern of a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the two vinyl protons is a classic signature for a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This fragment accounts for 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`-CH=CH-CH3`). It also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n3.  **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** The compound has an ester group and a second methyl group, but crucially, no `-CH2-` groups. This eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). The only way to incorporate the ester and the second methyl group without a `-CH2-` is to have either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH3`). Both of these fragments have the formula `C2H3O2`.\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from `C6H4` ring) + 3 (from `C3H5` propenyl) + 2 (from `C2H3O2` ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from `C6H4` ring) + 5 (from `C3H5` propenyl) + 3 (from `C2H3O2` ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**. This reasoning is sound and consistently appears across the majority of the provided answers.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe Degree of Unsaturation indicates the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **From the formula C11H12O2:** `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\nThe DoU values match, confirming the formula is correct.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options and Final Decision\nThe derived formula is **C11H12O2**. Now, we match this to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) C11H12O2**\n*   B) C12H14O2\n*   C) C12H12O2\n*   D) C11H14O2\n\nThe correct formula, C11H12O2, corresponds directly to option A. The other options are incorrect as they either have the wrong number of atoms or would require structural features (like a `-CH2-` group or the absence of a C=C bond) that are explicitly contradicted by the NMR data.\n\nWhile many of the candidate answers arrive at the correct formula `C11H12O2`, several incorrectly map this formula to the wrong letter choice. However, the underlying chemical analysis is overwhelmingly consistent and points to a single correct formula.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided information.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. The core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl (C=O).\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum to Identify Substituents:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) arrangement. This accounts for the 4 hydrogens of the C₆H₄ ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, resulting in a doublet. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl signal is from the propenyl group just identified. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out structures containing ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) or longer alkyl chains. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃) to account for the second methyl group without introducing a methylene group. Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    We combine the identified fragments to build the complete molecule:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester and second methyl group: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   **From the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n    *   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   The DoU values match, confirming the consistency of the derived formula and structure.\n\n5.  **Select the Final Answer:**\n    The derived chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n\n    The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first and most critical step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the constituent parts of the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four remaining protons (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4). This gives us the core fragment **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **¹H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **¹H NMR shows two –CH₃ signals and no –CH₂ signals:** We have already accounted for one methyl group in the propenyl substituent. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. The crucial constraint is the absence of any methylene (–CH₂–) signals. This rules out structures like an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (–COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (–OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This conclusion was reached unanimously by all candidate answers, demonstrating the strength of this chemical reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in the molecule. This serves as an excellent verification tool.\n\n*   **DoU from the structural features:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n\nThe DoU values match perfectly, confirming that C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the correct formula.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options and Final Decision\n\nThe final step is to match our derived formula with the provided options.\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2**\n*   B) C11H14O2\n*   C) C12H12O2\n*   D) C12H14O2\n\nOur derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, directly matches option A.\n\nWe can definitively rule out the other options:\n*   **B) C11H14O2:** Has a DoU of 5, which is inconsistent with the presence of the aromatic ring, a vinyl group, and an ester.\n*   **C) C12H12O2:** Has a DoU of 7, which would require an extra ring or double bond not supported by the data.\n*   **D) C12H14O2:** While this has the correct DoU of 6, it contains an additional CH₂ group compared to the correct formula. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**, making this option impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which is characteristic of a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and contains one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Second Methyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups.\" One is in the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester functionality.\n    *   **No –CH₂ Groups:** This is a critical constraint. To form an ester with a methyl group without introducing a -CH₂- group (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the fragment must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    We combine the identified fragments to find the total atom count:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Summing the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   **From Structure:** The structure contains a benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation), one C=C double bond (1 degree), and one C=O double bond (1 degree). Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n    *   **From Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2)`. For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, this is `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n    *   The DoU values match, confirming the formula is correct.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.

The other options are incorrect because they either have the wrong number of atoms or would require the presence of -CH₂- groups (C₁₂H₁₄O₂), which are explicitly absent according to the NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe core of the problem is to translate the spectroscopic data into structural fragments and then assemble them to find the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The base fragment is **C₆H₄**. The 1H NMR data, showing only two signals for these four protons, strongly suggests a symmetrical 1,4- (para) substitution pattern.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which contains one carbonyl (C=O) and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**. It accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups.\n*   **1H NMR shows two -CH₃ group signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **1H NMR shows no -CH₂ group signals:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any other type that includes a methylene (-CH₂-) bridge. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OOCCH₃**). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall formula:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester/methyl fragment) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester/methyl fragment) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n*   The DoU values match, confirming the derived formula is consistent with the structure.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options and Final Decision\n\nThe derived formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. We now compare this to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (DoU = 5, incorrect)\n*   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DoU = 6, but contains an extra CH₂, which is ruled out by NMR)\n*   C) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** (DoU = 6, matches our derivation)\n*   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (DoU = 7, incorrect)\n\nThe analysis consistently and unambiguously points to **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** as the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic data. This corresponds to option C. The majority of the candidate answers reached this same conclusion in their reasoning, even if some made errors in matching the formula to the correct letter option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided answers to determine the final, correct choice.\n\nMy plan is to first independently verify the chemical formula by breaking down the spectroscopic data into molecular fragments. Then, I will sum the atoms of these fragments to derive the formula. Finally, I will write a Python script to automate this calculation and compare the result against the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Analysis:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic hydrogens. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n\n2.  **FTIR and Ester Analysis:** The FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-), which accounts for **2 oxygen atoms**. The ¹H NMR shows two -CH₃ signals and, crucially, **no -CH₂ signals**. One -CH₃ signal must belong to the ester. To have an ester with a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n3.  **Vinyl and Second Methyl Group Analysis:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and the second -CH₃ signal. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Formula:** By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The derived molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) from the Structural Information**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as Double Bond Equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, which accounts for **4 degrees of unsaturation**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-). The carbonyl (C=O) bond in the ester accounts for **1 degree of unsaturation**.\n*   **Vinyl-H Signals:** The presence of vinyl protons in the 1H NMR spectrum indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for **1 degree of unsaturation**.\n\nAdding these together, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\n**2. Calculate the DoU for Each of the Given Chemical Formulas**\nThe formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (This matches our requirement).\n*   **B) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. (This also matches our requirement).\n*   **C) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = **7**. (This does not match).\n*   **D) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = **5**. (This does not match).\n\nBased on the DoU calculation, we can eliminate options C and D. The correct answer must be either A (C11H12O2) or B (C12H14O2).\n\n**3. Detailed Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify Fragments**\nWe need to use the detailed NMR data to distinguish between the remaining two options.\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4). This fragment is **C6H4**.\n*   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is **C3H5**.\n*   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** We have identified one -CH3 group in the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or any other ester with a methylene group. Therefore, the ester must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n**4. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula**\nLet's sum the atoms from the fragments we have identified:\n*   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   Propenyl group: C3H5\n*   Ester + methyl fragment: C2H3O2\n\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n\nThe chemical formula derived from a complete analysis of the spectroscopic data is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe derived formula C11H12O2 matches option A. The other remaining possibility, C12H14O2 (option B), would contain an additional CH2 group compared to our derived structure. The problem explicitly states there are no signals for -CH2- groups, which definitively rules out option B.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the given data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core of this fragment is C₆H₄.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl (C=O) bond.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates any structures containing methylene groups (e.g., ethyl, propyl chains).\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum to Identify Substituents:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution. This accounts for the C₆H₄ fragment and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH₃**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three methyl protons (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, resulting in a doublet (d).\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, which has the formula **C₃H₅**. This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** We have identified one methyl group in the propenyl substituent. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH₂ groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, it must be a methyl ester (–COOCH₃) or an acetate group (–OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n    *   **DoU from the candidate formulas:**\n        *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n        *   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6 (Plausible DoU, but requires a -CH₂- group, which is absent)\n        *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n        *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6** (Correct)\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data unambiguously leads to the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation and is the only option consistent with all the NMR signals, particularly the absence of any -CH₂- groups. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the task is to deduce a chemical formula from a combination of spectroscopic data (FTIR and ¹H NMR). The key pieces of information are:\n1.  A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\n2.  An ester group is present.\n3.  There are six signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n4.  Two signals are for aromatic protons.\n5.  Two signals are for vinyl protons (a doublet and a doublet of quartets).\n6.  Two signals are for methyl (-CH₃) groups.\n7.  There are **no** signals for methylene (-CH₂) groups.\n\n### Step-by-Step Deduction\n\n1.  **Identify Molecular Fragments:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted aromatic ring with two proton signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substituted benzene ring. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The specific splitting pattern of a doublet and a doublet of quartets for two vinyl protons is a classic signature of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH₃**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester (-COO-). The NMR shows a second methyl signal. The crucial constraint is the absence of any -CH₂- signals. This rules out common ester types like ethyl esters (-COOCH₂CH₃). The only way to have an ester and a methyl group without a methylene group is to have either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula:\n    *   From the aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   From the propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   From the ester/methyl fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU indicates the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   **From the structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**.\n    *   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    The DoU values match, confirming the formula is consistent with the structure.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n    *   **B) C11H14O2:** Incorrect hydrogen count and DoU (5). This would imply the absence of the vinyl C=C bond.\n    *   **C) C12H12O2:** Incorrect carbon count and DoU (7).\n    *   **D) C12H14O2:** Incorrect carbon and hydrogen count. This formula has an extra CH₂ group compared to the correct answer, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data consistently leads to the chemical formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This formula perfectly accounts for all the described signals and constraints, particularly the specific vinyl splitting pattern and the absence of -CH₂- groups. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe first step is to break down the information from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra to identify the key structural fragments of the molecule. This analysis was performed consistently and correctly by nearly all the provided answers.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core fragment is **C₆H₄**. The fact that there are only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **1H NMR - Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum shows two vinyl proton signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **1H NMR - Two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester.\n*   **1H NMR - No –CH₂ group signals:** This is a critical constraint. To have an ester with a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, the fragment must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate (**-OCOCH₃**). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\n\nThe next step is to combine the identified fragments and sum their atoms to find the molecular formula.\n\n*   Aromatic ring fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl group fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester and second methyl fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nA crucial check is to ensure the degree of unsaturation (number of rings + pi bonds) matches for both the formula and the structure.\n\n*   **DoU from the formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):**\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n*   **DoU from the structural fragments:**\n    Aromatic ring (1 ring, 3 double bonds) = 4\n    Vinyl C=C double bond = 1\n    Ester C=O double bond = 1\n    Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**\n\nThe DoU values match, confirming that **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** is the correct formula.\n\n### Step 4: Select the Final Answer\n\nThe final step is to match the derived formula with the given options.\n\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n*   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n*   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n*   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option D.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\nWhile almost all candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis to arrive at the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂, many failed to select the correct corresponding letter from the provided options. This appears to be due to confusion or using a different set of options. However, the scientific reasoning consistently and overwhelmingly supports C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The agents that correctly mapped this formula to the given options (e.g., Answers 4, 7, and 8) selected D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe core of the problem is to translate the spectroscopic data into structural fragments and then assemble them to find the molecular formula. All candidate answers correctly follow this process.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is identified as a C₆H₄ fragment. The presence of only two aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR strongly suggests a symmetrical 1,4- (para) substitution pattern.\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR data confirms a -COO- group, which contains one carbonyl (C=O) and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Vinyl group:** The ¹H NMR signals of a doublet and a doublet of quartets are unanimously and correctly identified as a characteristic pattern for a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH₃. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n*   **Methyl groups:** The ¹H NMR shows two distinct -CH₃ signals. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester.\n*   **No -CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or contain any other methylene bridge. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly part of the ester, as in a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃).\n\n### 2. Assembling the Fragments and Determining the Formula\n\nAll candidate answers correctly combine these fragments to deduce the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Ester + Methyl Group:** This combined fragment is C₂H₃O₂ (e.g., -COOCH₃).\n\nSumming the atoms from these fragments gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nA key verification step, used by many of the candidate answers, is to check the Degree of Unsaturation.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the potential formulas:**\n    *   C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. **(Matches)**\n    *   C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. **(Matches)**\n\nThis initial check eliminates two options, leaving C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\n### 4. Final Decision Point\n\nThe final distinction between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ relies on the \"no –CH₂ groups\" constraint. The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has one more carbon and two more hydrogens than C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to an additional -CH₂- group. Since the ¹H NMR spectrum explicitly shows no signals for -CH₂- groups, the formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ can be definitively ruled out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll fifteen candidate answers, through correct and consistent chemical reasoning, conclude that the molecular formula must be C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The analysis of the structural fragments derived from the NMR and FTIR data is unambiguous and points to this single result.\n\nThe provided options are:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. The core fragment is **C₆H₄**. The ¹H NMR shows two signals for the 4 aromatic protons, which strongly suggests a symmetrical 1,4- (para) substitution pattern.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and contains one C=C double bond.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal is part of the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester.\n    *   **¹H NMR shows no signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other chain with a -CH₂- unit. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly part of the ester, forming either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate group (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    We combine the identified fragments to find the total number of atoms:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Summing these up:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU indicates the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\n    The values match, confirming the formula is consistent with the structure.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DoU = 6)\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (DoU = 7)\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (DoU = 6)\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (DoU = 5)\n\n    The DoU calculation eliminates options B and D. We are left with A and C.\n    Our detailed fragment analysis derived the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n    Option A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) differs from our derived formula by one CH₂ group. The problem explicitly states there are **no –CH₂ groups**, which definitively rules out option A.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the given options.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) from the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the double bond equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. We can deduce this from the structural information provided:\n*   **6-membered aromatic ring:** This accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n*   **Ester group (-COO-):** The carbonyl (C=O) bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\nAdding these together, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the DoU for Each Chemical Formula Option**\n\nThe formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **A) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**\n*   **D) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n\nBased on the DoU calculation, we can eliminate options A and B. The correct formula must be either C12H14O2 or C11H12O2.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Fragments to Build the Structure**\n\nWe can use the detailed NMR data to count the atoms and distinguish between the remaining two options.\n\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution. This fragment is **C6H4**.\n*   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n*   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One -CH3 signal is from the propenyl group. The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. To form an ester with a methyl group and no methylene (-CH2-) groups, the fragment must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   Propenyl group: C3H5\n*   Ester + methyl part: C2H3O2\n\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe formula derived from a detailed analysis of all spectroscopic data is C11H12O2. This matches the DoU of 6. The other remaining option, C12H14O2, has the correct DoU but contains an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**, which definitively rules out C12H14O2.\n\nTherefore, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula, considering all the provided information and identifying key points.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as Double Bond Equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. We can determine the required DoU from the structural information provided:\n*   **6-membered aromatic ring:** This accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring + three double bonds).\n*   **Ester group (-COO-):** The carbonyl (C=O) bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\nAdding these up, the total required DoU for the molecule is 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for each of the given options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n*   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n*   B) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6\n*   C) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6\n*   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\nThis initial analysis eliminates options A and D, as their DoU values do not match the required value of 6. The correct answer must be either B (C12H14O2) or C (C11H12O2).\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data to Identify Molecular Fragments**\n\nThis step is crucial to distinguish between the remaining two options.\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **-CH₃ groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group.\n*   **No -CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. For the ester to have a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, it must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OOCCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n**3. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the fragments we have confidently identified from the spectroscopic data:\n*   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + second methyl group: C₂H₃O₂\n\nNow, we sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe formula derived from a detailed analysis of all the spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This matches option C.\n\nLet's re-examine the other possibility from the DoU calculation, option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). To get from our derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ to C₁₂H₁₄O₂, one would need to add a CH₂ group. However, the problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Structural Information and Calculate the Required Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), or double bond equivalent, tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. We can determine the required DoU from the structural information given:\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** A benzene ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, so it accounts for **4 DoU**.\n*   **Ester group (-COO-):** The carbonyl (C=O) double bond in the ester group accounts for **1 DoU**.\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for **1 DoU**.\n\nAdding these together, the molecule must have a total DoU of 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\n**2. Calculate the DoU for Each of the Candidate Formulas**\n\nThe formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   A) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**\n*   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = **5**\n*   C) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n*   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = **7**\n\nBased on this calculation, we can eliminate options B (DoU=5) and D (DoU=7). The correct answer must be either A (C12H14O2) or C (C11H12O2).\n\n**3. Deduce the Molecular Fragments from the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe NMR data allows us to piece together the exact structure.\n\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is **C6H4**.\n*   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is **C3H5**.\n*   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** We have identified one -CH3 group in the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. To have an ester with a methyl group but no -CH2- group, the fragment must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n**4. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   Propenyl group: C3H5\n*   Ester/methyl fragment: C2H3O2\n\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe formula derived from the detailed spectroscopic analysis is C11H12O2. This matches option C. We can also definitively rule out option A (C12H14O2). To get from C11H12O2 to C12H14O2, one would need to add a -CH2- group. The NMR data explicitly states there are no signals for -CH2- groups, making C12H14O2 impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the raw data from FTIR and 1H NMR into structural pieces of the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The core formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Two aromatic-H signals:** For a di-substituted ring, having only two proton signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This accounts for 4 hydrogens.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl (C=O).\n*   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for a C=C double bond, two vinyl protons, and one methyl group. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal is from the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester.\n*   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other alkyl chain with a -CH₂- unit. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the overall chemical formula.\n\n*   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester + Methyl Group):** C₂H₃O₂\n\nLet's sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Formula with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also called double bond equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from the derived structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the calculated formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n\nThe DoU values match, which strongly supports the correctness of the derived formula.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options and Conclude\n\nThe derived chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. We now compare this to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n*   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n*   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n*   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n\nThe calculated formula matches option B. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** Has a DoU of 5. This would mean one of the double bonds (likely the vinyl C=C) is missing, which contradicts the NMR data.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** Has a DoU of 6, but contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the correct formula. The NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH₂- groups.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** Has a DoU of 7, which is inconsistent with the identified structural features.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Chemical Reasoning\nThe fundamental task is to deduce the molecular formula from spectroscopic data. The key pieces of information are:\n*   A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\n*   An ester group (-COO-).\n*   No methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n*   Specific ¹H NMR signals: two for aromatic-H, two for vinyl-H (a doublet and a doublet of quartets), and two for methyl (-CH3) groups.\n\n### Step 2: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\nA consistent line of reasoning is present in nearly all the candidate answers:\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted aromatic ring with two proton signals implies a symmetrical, para-substituted `C6H4` fragment. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n2.  **Vinyl Group:** The specific splitting pattern of a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the two vinyl protons is a classic signature for a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This fragment accounts for 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`-CH=CH-CH3`). It also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n3.  **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** The compound has an ester group and a second methyl group, but crucially, no `-CH2-` groups. This eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). The only way to incorporate the ester and the second methyl group without a `-CH2-` is to have either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH3`). Both of these fragments have the formula `C2H3O2`.\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from `C6H4` ring) + 3 (from `C3H5` propenyl) + 2 (from `C2H3O2` ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from `C6H4` ring) + 5 (from `C3H5` propenyl) + 3 (from `C2H3O2` ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**. This reasoning is sound and consistently appears across the majority of the provided answers.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe Degree of Unsaturation indicates the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **From the formula C11H12O2:** `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\nThe DoU values match, confirming the formula is correct.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options and Final Decision\nThe derived formula is **C11H12O2**. Now, we match this to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) C11H12O2**\n*   B) C12H14O2\n*   C) C12H12O2\n*   D) C11H14O2\n\nThe correct formula, C11H12O2, corresponds directly to option A. The other options are incorrect as they either have the wrong number of atoms or would require structural features (like a `-CH2-` group or the absence of a C=C bond) that are explicitly contradicted by the NMR data.\n\nWhile many of the candidate answers arrive at the correct formula `C11H12O2`, several incorrectly map this formula to the wrong letter choice. However, the underlying chemical analysis is overwhelmingly consistent and points to a single correct formula.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided information.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. The core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl (C=O).\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum to Identify Substituents:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) arrangement. This accounts for the 4 hydrogens of the C₆H₄ ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, resulting in a doublet. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl signal is from the propenyl group just identified. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out structures containing ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) or longer alkyl chains. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃) to account for the second methyl group without introducing a methylene group. Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    We combine the identified fragments to build the complete molecule:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester and second methyl group: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   **From the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n    *   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   The DoU values match, confirming the consistency of the derived formula and structure.\n\n5.  **Select the Final Answer:**\n    The derived chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n\n    The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
