This is a directed aldol addition.\n    *   Acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde, the reaction is known to be highly diastereoselective, favoring the ***anti***-diastereomer. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)**, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Fluorination with DAST to form Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an **excess** of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions:** The use of excess DAST ensures that both susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is converted into a geminal difluoride (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemistry from the major *anti*-aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the ring is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the alcohol (the α-carbon), which was (S), undergoes inversion to become **(R)**.\n4.  **Final Product:** The major product formed is the racemic mixture of the **(2R, αR)** and **(2S, αS)** stereoisomers. The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry is (R*, R*).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   The final product is a 2-(fluorobenzyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane derivative. Options B and C are incorrect as they represent incompletely reacted products (a fluoroalcohol and a fluoroketone, respectively).\n*   We are left with options A and D, which differ only in their stereochemistry. There is a common typo in the IUPAC names provided in the options (listing \"2,2-difluoro\" when the reaction produces a \"1,1-difluoro\" group), so we must focus on the stereochemical descriptors (R/S).\n\n*   **Option A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:**\n    *   This name describes the stereoisomer where the ring stereocenter is **(R)** and the benzylic stereocenter is **(R)**.\n    *   This **(R, R)** configuration matches the major product we derived from the *anti*-aldol pathway.\n\n*   **Option D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:**\n    *   This name describes the stereoisomer where the ring stereocenter is **(R)** and the benzylic stereocenter is **(S)**.\n    *   This (R, S) configuration would be formed from the minor *syn*-aldol product.\n\nSince the reaction favors the *anti*-aldol product, the major final product will have the (R, R) relative stereochemistry. Option A correctly describes one of the enantiomers of this major product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**1. Analysis of the First Reaction: Aldol Addition**\n\n*   **Reactants and Reagents:** Cyclohexanone is treated with LDA (a strong, bulky base) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. This is a directed aldol addition.\n*   **Mechanism:** LDA deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. An acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is a β-hydroxy ketone, specifically **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. The reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde is known to be diastereoselective, favoring the formation of the ***anti*** **diastereomer**. The *anti* product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Second Reaction: Fluorination with DAST**\n\n*   **Reactant and Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of DAST (diethylaminosulfur trifluoride).\n*   **Mechanism:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups react.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the chiral center (Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemical changes from our chosen enantiomer of Product 1, (2R, αS).\n    *   The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2. The configuration at C2 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The fluorination of the alcohol at the benzylic carbon (α-carbon) proceeds with inversion. The configuration inverts from **(S) to (R)**.\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The major product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The other enantiomer formed would be (2S, αS). The key is that the relative stereochemistry is (R,R) or (S,S).\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Options A and B** can be eliminated immediately because they contain an alcohol or a ketone, respectively. Excess DAST would have converted both functional groups.\n*   **Options C and D** both describe the correct functional groups (a geminal difluoride on the ring and a single fluoride on the side chain). The difference is the stereochemistry. There is a likely typo in the IUPAC names (the difluoro group should be at C1, not C2), but we can rely on the stereochemical descriptors (R/S).\n    *   **Option C: ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene**. This name describes the isomer where the ring stereocenter (C2) is **(R)** and the benzylic stereocenter is **(R)**. This is the **(R, R)** isomer.\n    *   **Option D: ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene**. This name describes the isomer where the ring stereocenter (C2) is **(R)** and the benzylic stereocenter is **(S)**. This is the **(R, S)** isomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOur mechanistic analysis shows that the major product formed has the (R, R) relative stereochemistry. Option C correctly describes this stereoisomer.\n\n```python\ndef determine_final_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction\n    and determines the correct final product from the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Aldol Addition Analysis\n    # The reaction of cyclohexanone with LDA and benzaldehyde forms a beta-hydroxy ketone.\n    # The major product is the anti-diastereomer, which is a racemic mixture of (2R, alpha-S) and (2S, alpha-R) enantiomers.\n    step1_product = \"Product 1 is the anti-diastereomer of 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.

This is not the major product.\n\nThe final answer is C.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Cyclohexanone is treated with LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. The mixture is then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, only one enolate is formed.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical outcome of the aldol addition of a pre-formed lithium enolate is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone reacting with benzaldehyde, the transition state that places the bulky phenyl group in an equatorial-like position is favored. This leads to the formation of the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product. The *anti*-aldol product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers.\n    *   **Acidification:** The final step is an acidic workup to protonate the intermediate alkoxide, yielding the β-hydroxy ketone, Product 1.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The major product is the racemic *anti*-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one. We will follow one enantiomer, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST, Et₂NSF₃).\n2.  **Mechanism:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" DAST ensures that both the alcohol and the ketone functional groups will react.\n    *   **Reaction with the Ketone:** DAST converts a carbonyl group (C=O) into a geminal difluoride (CF₂). The ketone at C1 of the ring becomes a 1,1-difluoro group. This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Reaction with the Alcohol:** DAST converts a secondary alcohol (R-OH) into a fluoride (R-F). This reaction typically proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which results in **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We trace the change in stereochemistry from Product 1 to Product 2.\n    *   We start with the **(2R, αS)**-enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The ketone at C1 becomes CF₂. The stereocenter at C2 is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The alcohol at the α-carbon undergoes fluorination with inversion of configuration. Therefore, the α-carbon, which was **(S)**, becomes **(R)**.\n    *   This produces the **(2R, αR)** isomer of Product 2.\n    *   The other enantiomer of Product 1, (2S, αR), would similarly be converted to the (2S, αS) isomer of Product 2.\n4.  **Structure of Product 2:** The major product is the racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) isomers of 2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that matches one of the enantiomers of our predicted major product, which has (R, R) or (S, S) stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes an isomer with (R) stereochemistry at the ring carbon and (S) stereochemistry at the benzylic carbon. This is the (R, S) diastereomer, which would be a minor product.\n*   **B) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes an isomer with (R) stereochemistry at the ring carbon and (R) stereochemistry at the benzylic carbon. This is the (R, R) diastereomer, which matches one of the enantiomers of our predicted major product. (Note: There is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC name in the options, which should be \"1,1-difluoro...\". However, the stereochemical descriptors are the key to solving the problem).\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride (CF₂), not a fluoro-alcohol (-CF(OH)-).\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The ketone group would have been converted to a geminal difluoride by excess DAST.\n\nBased on the stereochemical analysis, the major product has (R, R) relative stereochemistry, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reagents:** The reaction begins with cyclohexanone, which is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by the addition of benzaldehyde. The reaction is then quenched with acid (acidified).\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates the α-carbon of cyclohexanone to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters: C2 on the cyclohexanone ring and the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (let's call it Cα). The stereoselectivity of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone reacting with an aldehyde is a classic problem in organic chemistry. While the simple Zimmerman-Traxler model for a Z-enolate predicts *syn* selectivity, it is a well-documented exception that this specific reaction favors the ***anti*** **diastereomer**. The *anti* product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an \"excess\" of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of excess reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is converted into a geminal difluoride (CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol (-OH) at Cα is converted into a fluoride (-F). This deoxofluorination reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism, which results in **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome of Product 2:**\n    *   We start with the (2R, αS) enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at Cα undergoes inversion from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   Therefore, the resulting product is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer. The other enantiomer from the starting material, (2S, αR), would yield the (2S, αS) product. The final product is a racemic mixture of the (R,R) and (S,S) isomers.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that matches the **(R,R)** stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This is a fluoroalcohol, not the final product. Excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride.\n*   **B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. This product still contains a ketone, which would have been fluorinated by excess DAST.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an (R) configuration at the ring stereocenter and an (R) configuration at the side-chain (benzylic) stereocenter. This corresponds to the **(R,R)** isomer we predicted as the major product. (Note: There is a likely typo in the IUPAC name, which should be \"1,1-difluoro\", but the stereochemical descriptors are the key information).\n*   **D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R,S) isomer. This would be the minor product, arising from the less-favored *syn*-aldol addition.\n\nBased on the established stereochemical preferences of the reactions, the major product has (R,R) relative stereochemistry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Formation of Product 1\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The first step is a directed aldol addition. Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form a kinetic lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. An acidic workup then protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n2.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is a β-hydroxy ketone, specifically **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) enantiomers (where α refers to the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Formation of Product 2\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction Type:** Product 1 is treated with an *excess* of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST). DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent is a critical detail, indicating that both susceptible functional groups will react.\n2.  **Functional Group Transformations:**\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted into a geminal difluoride (CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol group (-OH) on the side chain is converted into a fluoride (-F).\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:**\n    *   The conversion of the ketone at C1 to a CF₂ group does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   The fluorination of a secondary alcohol with DAST is a deoxyfluorination reaction that proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product\n\nTo find the structure of the major final product, we must trace the stereochemical changes from the major intermediate (the *anti*-aldol product).\n\n1.  Let's start with one enantiomer of the major *anti*-aldol product: **(2R, αR)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n2.  The stereocenter at C2 of the ring is unaffected by the subsequent reactions, so it remains **(R)**.\n3.  The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) undergoes inversion during fluorination with DAST. Therefore, its configuration changes from **(R)** to **(S)**.\n4.  The major final product is the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer (and its mirror image, the (2S, αR) enantiomer, which is formed from the other starting enantiomer).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\n\nWe are looking for the option that represents the (2R, αS) stereoisomer.\n\n*   **A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The product is a fluoroalcohol, but excess DAST would convert the ketone to a geminal difluoride.\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule where the stereocenter on the side chain (the \"fluoromethyl\" part) is **(S)** and the stereocenter on the ring (the \"cyclohexyl\" part) is **(R)**. This corresponds to the **(2R, αS)** structure we determined to be the major product.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the (2R, αR) stereoisomer. This would be the minor product, as it would arise from the minor *syn*-aldol intermediate.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The product still contains a ketone, which would have been converted by the excess DAST.\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the major product has the (R, S) relative stereochemistry, which matches the description in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde is known to be highly diastereoselective, proceeding through a Zimmerman-Traxler transition state to favor the ***anti***-diastereomer. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an **excess** of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Mechanism:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of an excess of the reagent ensures that both the alcohol and ketone functional groups react.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n3.  **Structure of Product 2:** The final product's constitution is **2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Final Stereochemistry**\n\nTo find the major product, we trace the stereochemistry from the major *anti*-aldol product formed in Step 1.\n\n1.  Let's consider the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer of the *anti*-aldol product.\n2.  The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2, so it remains **(R)**.\n3.  The fluorination of the alcohol at the α-carbon proceeds with inversion. The **(S)** configuration inverts to an **(R)** configuration.\n4.  Therefore, the (2R, αS) enantiomer of Product 1 is converted to the **(2R, αR)** enantiomer of Product 2.\n5.  The other enantiomer of the starting material, (2S, αR), would similarly yield the (2S, αS) product. The final product is a racemic mixture of the (R,R) and (S,S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **Functional Groups:** Options B and C are incorrect because they retain either an alcohol or a ketone group. Excess DAST would have converted both.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We are looking for the option that describes the (R,R) or (S,S) stereoisomer.\n    *   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the stereoisomer where the ring stereocenter is (R) and the benzylic stereocenter is (R). This corresponds to the **(R,R)** isomer, which is one of the enantiomers of the major product.\n    *   **D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the stereoisomer where the ring stereocenter is (R) and the benzylic stereocenter is (S). This is the **(R,S)** isomer, which is a different diastereomer and not the major product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence preferentially forms the *anti*-aldol product, which, upon fluorination with inversion of configuration, yields the (R,R) and (S,S) stereoisomers. Option A correctly describes one of the enantiomers of this major product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereoselectivity of the aldol addition of a cyclohexanone lithium enolate with an aldehyde is well-studied. Under these kinetic conditions (LDA, -78 °C), the reaction favors the formation of the ***anti*** **diastereomer**. The *anti* product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α denotes the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). For the next step, we will track the fate of one of these enantiomers: **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   It converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   It converts secondary alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Transformation of Product 1:**\n    *   The ketone at C1 is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group. This does not affect the stereocenter at C2.\n    *   The secondary alcohol at the α-carbon is converted to a fluoride, and its stereocenter is inverted.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Final Stereochemistry\n\n*   We start with the major *anti*-aldol product, specifically the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer.\n*   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n*   The stereocenter at the α-carbon undergoes inversion from **(S)** to **(R)**.\n*   Therefore, the resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The reaction produces a racemic mixture of this (2R, αR) isomer and its (2S, αS) enantiomer. The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry of the two chiral centers is (R*, R*).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must now match our derived product with the given options.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) isomer (R on the ring, S on the side chain). This would be the minor product, derived from the *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **B) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) isomer (R on the ring, R on the side chain). This matches the stereochemistry of the major product we derived.\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. It is a fluoroalcohol, meaning the ketone did not fully react to a geminal difluoride, which is inconsistent with the use of excess DAST.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. It is a fluoroketone, meaning the ketone did not react at all.\n\n**Note on Nomenclature:** The options contain a common error, naming the product as a \"2,2-difluorocyclohexyl\" derivative. The reaction mechanism clearly forms a \"1,1-difluoro\" group with the side chain at C2. Assuming this is a typo in the question, the stereochemical descriptors are the deciding factor.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has the (R, R) relative stereochemistry, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** The reaction begins with cyclohexanone, which is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. The reaction is then quenched with acid.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates the α-carbon of cyclohexanone to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is governed by the Zimmerman-Traxler transition state model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the major product is the ***anti***-diastereomer. This is due to steric factors where the bulky phenyl group of benzaldehyde preferentially occupies an equatorial position in the chair-like transition state. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α is the benzylic carbon).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Mechanism:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both the alcohol and ketone functional groups react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol (-OH) at the α-position is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction (deoxyfluorination) proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2**\n\nTo find the stereochemistry of the major product, we trace the transformation of one of the enantiomers of the major *anti*-aldol product.\n\n1.  Start with the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer of Product 1.\n2.  React with excess DAST:\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the α-carbon undergoes inversion from (S) to **(R)**.\n3.  The resulting major product is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer (and its enantiomer, the (2S, αS) isomer). The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry is (R,R) or (S,S).\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with the correct functional groups (geminal difluoride and a single fluoride). It specifies the stereochemistry as **(R)** at the ring's chiral center (C2) and **(R)** at the benzylic chiral center. This matches the stereochemistry of the major product we derived. (Note: There is a common typo in such questions where the product `2-(side-chain)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane` is named as `...-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl...`. We focus on the stereochemistry, which is the intended point of the question).\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the (R,S) stereoisomer. This would be the minor product, arising from the minor *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **C) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The ketone group would have been converted to a geminal difluoride by the excess DAST.\n*   **D) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride (CF₂), not a fluoro-alcohol (-CF(OH)-).\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product of the reaction sequence has (R,R) stereochemistry, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone, which is Product 1. The structure is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. This is because the transition state leading to the *anti*-product allows the bulky phenyl group to occupy a pseudo-equatorial position, which is sterically favored over the axial position required for the *syn*-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. For the next step, we will follow one of these enantiomers, for example, **(2R)-2-((S)-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups react.\n    *   It converts the ketone (C=O) at C1 to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   It converts the secondary alcohol (-OH) to a fluoride (-F). This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:**\n    *   We start with the (2R, αS)-enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2, so its configuration remains **(R)**.\n    *   The fluorination of the secondary alcohol at the benzylic position (α-carbon) proceeds with inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  **Final Product:** The major product formed is the (2R, αR) stereoisomer (and its enantiomer, the (2S, αS) isomer). The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry of the two centers is (R*, R*).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the (R, R) stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer (Ring is R, benzylic is S). This is incorrect.\n*   **B) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) stereoisomer (Ring is R, benzylic is R). This matches our derived stereochemistry for the major product. (Note: There is a common typo in such questions where the product, 2-(side chain)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane, is named as a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl derivative. We focus on the stereochemical descriptors, which are the key to solving the problem).\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is an incorrect structure. Excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride (CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is an incorrect structure. Excess DAST would also have reacted with the ketone.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R, R) stereochemistry, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reagents:** The reaction begins with cyclohexanone, which is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by the addition of benzaldehyde. The reaction is completed with an acidic workup.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters: C2 on the cyclohexanone ring and the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (let's call it Cα). The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. While the simple model for (Z)-enolates (like that from cyclohexanone) predicts *syn* selectivity, it is a well-documented exception that the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone reacts with benzaldehyde to give the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product.\n    *   The *anti*-diastereomer is the racemic mixture of the **(2R, αR)** and **(2S, αS)** enantiomers. We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αR)**, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent is a key piece of information, indicating that it will react with all susceptible functional groups.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). For secondary alcohols, this reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Transformation of Product 1:**\n    *   The ketone group at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol group on the side chain is converted to a fluoride.\n4.  **Structure of Product 2:** The final product's constitution is **2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2**\n\nWe trace the stereochemical changes from the major enantiomer of Product 1, the **(2R, αR)** isomer.\n\n*   The reaction at the C1 ketone does not affect the stereocenter at C2. Therefore, the C2 configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   The reaction at the Cα alcohol proceeds with inversion of configuration. Therefore, the **(R)** configuration at Cα is inverted to an **(S)** configuration.\n\nThe resulting major product is the racemic mixture of the **(2R, αS)** and **(2S, αR)** enantiomers.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (2R, αS) isomer. The `(R)` refers to the cyclohexyl ring stereocenter (C2), and the `(S)` refers to the fluoromethyl side chain stereocenter (Cα). This matches the major product we derived. (Note: There is a common typo in such problems where \"2,2-difluoro\" is written instead of \"1,1-difluoro\". The stereochemistry is the deciding factor).\n*   **B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect because the ketone group would have been converted to a difluoride by the excess DAST.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (2R, αR) isomer. This would be the minor product, derived from the *syn*-aldol followed by inversion.\n*   **D) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect because the ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride, not a fluoro-alcohol.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R,S) relative stereochemistry, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reagents:** The reaction begins with cyclohexanone, which is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by the addition of benzaldehyde.

The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed under kinetic control is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an \"excess\" of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of excess reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at the C1 position is converted into a geminal difluoride (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol group (-OH) is converted into a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemical changes from the major *anti*-aldol product:\n    *   We start with the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) undergoes inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  **Final Product Structure:** The major product formed is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer (and its (S,S) enantiomer). The constitutional structure is 2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the **(R, R)** stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an **(R)** configuration at the benzylic carbon (`(R)-...fluoromethyl`) and an **(R)** configuration at the ring carbon to which it is attached (`(R)-...cyclohexyl`). This corresponds to the **(R, R)** stereoisomer we predicted as the major product.\n*   **B) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol.\n*   **C) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the (R, S) stereoisomer.

This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:** LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form a lithium enolate under kinetic control. This nucleophilic enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The subsequent acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters.

The (R, R) stereochemistry correctly identifies the major product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:** LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form a lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The subsequent acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler transition state model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product.

The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups—the ketone and the alcohol—will react.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted to a fluoride (-F).\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Fluorination:** The fluorination of a secondary alcohol with DAST is a stereospecific reaction that proceeds with **inversion of configuration** (an Sₙ2-like mechanism). The conversion of the ketone at C1 to a difluoride does not affect the stereocenter at C2.\n\n### Determining the Final Stereochemistry\n\n*   We start with the major aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer.\n*   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected, so it remains **(R)**.\n*   The stereocenter at the alcohol (the α-carbon) has an (S) configuration. This center undergoes inversion during fluorination, so its configuration becomes **(R)**.\n*   Therefore, the major enantiomer of Product 2 has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The final product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) isomers.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that corresponds to the (R, R) stereoisomer.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (Ring-R, Benzylic-S) isomer. This is not the major product.\n*   **B) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is an incorrect structure. Excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (Ring-R, Benzylic-R) isomer. This matches the stereochemistry of the major product derived from our analysis.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is an incorrect structure. Excess DAST also reacts with the ketone.\n\n**Note on Nomenclature:** There is a likely error in the IUPAC names provided in options A and C. The reaction mechanism places the geminal difluoride at the C1 position (the original carbonyl carbon), so the correct name should be based on a \"1,1-difluorocyclohexyl\" group, not \"2,2-difluorocyclohexyl\". However, ignoring this common type of error in test questions, the stereochemical descriptors are the key to finding the correct answer.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R, R) stereochemistry, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:** LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. An acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α refers to the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)**, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactivity of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups—the ketone and the alcohol—will react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is converted into a geminal difluoride (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted into a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We trace the stereochemistry from the major *anti*-aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) undergoes inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  **Structure of Product 2:** The resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The overall reaction produces a racemic mixture of this (2R, αR) product and its (2S, αS) enantiomer.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Options\n\nWe must find the option that corresponds to the (R, R) stereoisomer.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer (R at the ring, S at the side chain). This would be the minor product, derived from the *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is an incorrect structure, as the ketone would have been fluorinated by the excess DAST.\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is an incorrect structure (a fluorohydrin), not the final product of the reaction with excess DAST.\n*   **D) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) stereoisomer (R at the ring, R at the side chain). This matches the major product derived from our analysis.\n\nNote: There is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC names provided in the options. The reaction produces a 1,1-difluoro-2-substituted cyclohexane, not a 2,2-difluoro-1-substituted one.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then the reaction mixture is acidified. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon under kinetic control (low temperature) to form the lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The subsequent acidic workup protonates the intermediate alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone, which is Product 1.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The constitutional structure of Product 1 is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. This is because the chair-like transition state that places the bulky phenyl group in a pseudo-equatorial position is sterically favored. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the **(2R, αS)** and **(2S, αR)** enantiomers (where α refers to the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an *excess* of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent is a critical detail, indicating that both susceptible functional groups—the ketone and the alcohol—will react.\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is converted into a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol group (-OH) is converted into a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemical changes from the major *anti*-aldol product:\n    *   We start with the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the adjacent stereocenter at C2, so its configuration remains **(R)**.\n    *   The fluorination of the secondary alcohol at the benzylic carbon (α-carbon) proceeds with inversion. Therefore, the initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  **Final Product:** The major product formed is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer. The overall reaction produces a racemic mixture of this (2R, αR) product and its (2S, αS) enantiomer. The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry of the two centers is (R*, R*).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **Incorrect Functional Groups:** Options B and D can be eliminated immediately. Option B retains the ketone, and option D is a fluoroalcohol. Excess DAST would convert the ketone to a geminal difluoride.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We are left with options A and C, which both describe the correct functional groups but differ in stereochemistry. We are looking for the **(R, R)** isomer.\n    *   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer where the stereocenter on the ring is (R) and the stereocenter on the benzylic side chain is (R). This is the **(R, R)** isomer, which matches our derived major product.\n    *   **C) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the isomer where the ring stereocenter is (R) and the benzylic stereocenter is (S). This is the **(R, S)** isomer, which would be a minor product.\n\n**Note on Nomenclature:** There is a likely typographical error in the IUPAC names provided in the options. The reaction mechanism indicates the formation of a 1,1-difluorocyclohexane ring, but the options name it as a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl group. Assuming this is an error in the locant numbering, the stereochemical descriptors are the key to solving the problem.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R, R) relative stereochemistry.\n\n<<<A>>>"

There is a common typo in the IUPAC names provided in the options (listing \"2,2-difluoro\" when the reaction produces a \"1,1-difluoro\" group), so we must focus on the stereochemical descriptors (R/S).\n\n*   **Option A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:**\n    *   This name describes the stereoisomer where the ring stereocenter is **(R)** and the benzylic stereocenter is **(R)**.\n    *   This **(R, R)** configuration matches the major product we derived from the *anti*-aldol pathway.\n\n*   **Option D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:**\n    *   This name describes the stereoisomer where the ring stereocenter is **(R)** and the benzylic stereocenter is **(S)**.\n    *   This (R, S) configuration would be formed from the minor *syn*-aldol product.\n\nSince the reaction favors the *anti*-aldol product, the major final product will have the (R, R) relative stereochemistry.

Analysis of the First Reaction: Aldol Addition**\n\n*   **Reactants and Reagents:** Cyclohexanone is treated with LDA (a strong, bulky base) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. This is a directed aldol addition.\n*   **Mechanism:** LDA deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. An acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is a β-hydroxy ketone, specifically **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. The reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde is known to be diastereoselective, favoring the formation of the ***anti*** **diastereomer**.

Analysis of the Second Reaction: Fluorination with DAST**\n\n*   **Reactant and Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of DAST (diethylaminosulfur trifluoride).\n*   **Mechanism:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups react.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the chiral center (Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemical changes from our chosen enantiomer of Product 1, (2R, αS).\n    *   The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2. The configuration at C2 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The fluorination of the alcohol at the benzylic carbon (α-carbon) proceeds with inversion. The configuration inverts from **(S) to (R)**.\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The major product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The other enantiomer formed would be (2S, αS). The key is that the relative stereochemistry is (R,R) or (S,S).\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Options A and B** can be eliminated immediately because they contain an alcohol or a ketone, respectively. Excess DAST would have converted both functional groups.\n*   **Options C and D** both describe the correct functional groups (a geminal difluoride on the ring and a single fluoride on the side chain). The difference is the stereochemistry. There is a likely typo in the IUPAC names (the difluoro group should be at C1, not C2), but we can rely on the stereochemical descriptors (R/S).\n    *   **Option C: ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene**. This name describes the isomer where the ring stereocenter (C2) is **(R)** and the benzylic stereocenter is **(R)**.

The mixture is then acidified.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, only one enolate is formed.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical outcome of the aldol addition of a pre-formed lithium enolate is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone reacting with benzaldehyde, the transition state that places the bulky phenyl group in an equatorial-like position is favored. This leads to the formation of the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product. The *anti*-aldol product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers.\n    *   **Acidification:** The final step is an acidic workup to protonate the intermediate alkoxide, yielding the β-hydroxy ketone, Product 1.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The major product is the racemic *anti*-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one. We will follow one enantiomer, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST, Et₂NSF₃).\n2.  **Mechanism:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" DAST ensures that both the alcohol and the ketone functional groups will react.\n    *   **Reaction with the Ketone:** DAST converts a carbonyl group (C=O) into a geminal difluoride (CF₂). The ketone at C1 of the ring becomes a 1,1-difluoro group. This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Reaction with the Alcohol:** DAST converts a secondary alcohol (R-OH) into a fluoride (R-F). This reaction typically proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which results in **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We trace the change in stereochemistry from Product 1 to Product 2.\n    *   We start with the **(2R, αS)**-enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The ketone at C1 becomes CF₂. The stereocenter at C2 is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The alcohol at the α-carbon undergoes fluorination with inversion of configuration. Therefore, the α-carbon, which was **(S)**, becomes **(R)**.\n    *   This produces the **(2R, αR)** isomer of Product 2.\n    *   The other enantiomer of Product 1, (2S, αR), would similarly be converted to the (2S, αS) isomer of Product 2.\n4.  **Structure of Product 2:** The major product is the racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) isomers of 2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that matches one of the enantiomers of our predicted major product, which has (R, R) or (S, S) stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes an isomer with (R) stereochemistry at the ring carbon and (S) stereochemistry at the benzylic carbon. This is the (R, S) diastereomer, which would be a minor product.\n*   **B) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes an isomer with (R) stereochemistry at the ring carbon and (R) stereochemistry at the benzylic carbon. This is the (R, R) diastereomer, which matches one of the enantiomers of our predicted major product. (Note: There is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC name in the options, which should be \"1,1-difluoro...\". However, the stereochemical descriptors are the key to solving the problem).\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride (CF₂), not a fluoro-alcohol (-CF(OH)-).\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The ketone group would have been converted to a geminal difluoride by excess DAST.\n\nBased on the stereochemical analysis, the major product has (R, R) relative stereochemistry, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reagents:** The reaction begins with cyclohexanone, which is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by the addition of benzaldehyde. The reaction is then quenched with acid (acidified).\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates the α-carbon of cyclohexanone to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters: C2 on the cyclohexanone ring and the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (let's call it Cα). The stereoselectivity of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone reacting with an aldehyde is a classic problem in organic chemistry. While the simple Zimmerman-Traxler model for a Z-enolate predicts *syn* selectivity, it is a well-documented exception that this specific reaction favors the ***anti*** **diastereomer**. The *anti* product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an \"excess\" of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of excess reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is converted into a geminal difluoride (CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol (-OH) at Cα is converted into a fluoride (-F). This deoxofluorination reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism, which results in **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome of Product 2:**\n    *   We start with the (2R, αS) enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at Cα undergoes inversion from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   Therefore, the resulting product is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer. The other enantiomer from the starting material, (2S, αR), would yield the (2S, αS) product. The final product is a racemic mixture of the (R,R) and (S,S) isomers.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that matches the **(R,R)** stereochemistry.\n\n*   **A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This is a fluoroalcohol, not the final product. Excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride.\n*   **B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. This product still contains a ketone, which would have been fluorinated by excess DAST.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an (R) configuration at the ring stereocenter and an (R) configuration at the side-chain (benzylic) stereocenter. This corresponds to the **(R,R)** isomer we predicted as the major product. (Note: There is a likely typo in the IUPAC name, which should be \"1,1-difluoro\", but the stereochemical descriptors are the key information).\n*   **D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R,S) isomer. This would be the minor product, arising from the less-favored *syn*-aldol addition.\n\nBased on the established stereochemical preferences of the reactions, the major product has (R,R) relative stereochemistry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Formation of Product 1\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The first step is a directed aldol addition. Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form a kinetic lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. An acidic workup then protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n2.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is a β-hydroxy ketone, specifically **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) enantiomers (where α refers to the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Formation of Product 2\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction Type:** Product 1 is treated with an *excess* of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST). DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent is a critical detail, indicating that both susceptible functional groups will react.\n2.  **Functional Group Transformations:**\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted into a geminal difluoride (CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol group (-OH) on the side chain is converted into a fluoride (-F).\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:**\n    *   The conversion of the ketone at C1 to a CF₂ group does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   The fluorination of a secondary alcohol with DAST is a deoxyfluorination reaction that proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product\n\nTo find the structure of the major final product, we must trace the stereochemical changes from the major intermediate (the *anti*-aldol product).\n\n1.  Let's start with one enantiomer of the major *anti*-aldol product: **(2R, αR)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n2.  The stereocenter at C2 of the ring is unaffected by the subsequent reactions, so it remains **(R)**.\n3.  The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) undergoes inversion during fluorination with DAST. Therefore, its configuration changes from **(R)** to **(S)**.\n4.  The major final product is the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer (and its mirror image, the (2S, αR) enantiomer, which is formed from the other starting enantiomer).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\n\nWe are looking for the option that represents the (2R, αS) stereoisomer.\n\n*   **A) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The product is a fluoroalcohol, but excess DAST would convert the ketone to a geminal difluoride.\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule where the stereocenter on the side chain (the \"fluoromethyl\" part) is **(S)** and the stereocenter on the ring (the \"cyclohexyl\" part) is **(R)**. This corresponds to the **(2R, αS)** structure we determined to be the major product.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the (2R, αR) stereoisomer. This would be the minor product, as it would arise from the minor *syn*-aldol intermediate.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The product still contains a ketone, which would have been converted by the excess DAST.\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the major product has the (R, S) relative stereochemistry, which matches the description in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde is known to be highly diastereoselective, proceeding through a Zimmerman-Traxler transition state to favor the ***anti***-diastereomer. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an **excess** of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Mechanism:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of an excess of the reagent ensures that both the alcohol and ketone functional groups react.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n3.  **Structure of Product 2:** The final product's constitution is **2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Final Stereochemistry**\n\nTo find the major product, we trace the stereochemistry from the major *anti*-aldol product formed in Step 1.\n\n1.  Let's consider the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer of the *anti*-aldol product.\n2.  The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2, so it remains **(R)**.\n3.  The fluorination of the alcohol at the α-carbon proceeds with inversion. The **(S)** configuration inverts to an **(R)** configuration.\n4.  Therefore, the (2R, αS) enantiomer of Product 1 is converted to the **(2R, αR)** enantiomer of Product 2.\n5.  The other enantiomer of the starting material, (2S, αR), would similarly yield the (2S, αS) product. The final product is a racemic mixture of the (R,R) and (S,S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **Functional Groups:** Options B and C are incorrect because they retain either an alcohol or a ketone group. Excess DAST would have converted both.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We are looking for the option that describes the (R,R) or (S,S) stereoisomer.\n    *   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the stereoisomer where the ring stereocenter is (R) and the benzylic stereocenter is (R). This corresponds to the **(R,R)** isomer, which is one of the enantiomers of the major product.\n    *   **D) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the stereoisomer where the ring stereocenter is (R) and the benzylic stereocenter is (S). This is the **(R,S)** isomer, which is a different diastereomer and not the major product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence preferentially forms the *anti*-aldol product, which, upon fluorination with inversion of configuration, yields the (R,R) and (S,S) stereoisomers. Option A correctly describes one of the enantiomers of this major product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereoselectivity of the aldol addition of a cyclohexanone lithium enolate with an aldehyde is well-studied. Under these kinetic conditions (LDA, -78 °C), the reaction favors the formation of the ***anti*** **diastereomer**. The *anti* product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α denotes the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). For the next step, we will track the fate of one of these enantiomers: **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups will react.\n    *   It converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   It converts secondary alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Transformation of Product 1:**\n    *   The ketone at C1 is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group. This does not affect the stereocenter at C2.\n    *   The secondary alcohol at the α-carbon is converted to a fluoride, and its stereocenter is inverted.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Final Stereochemistry\n\n*   We start with the major *anti*-aldol product, specifically the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer.\n*   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n*   The stereocenter at the α-carbon undergoes inversion from **(S)** to **(R)**.\n*   Therefore, the resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The reaction produces a racemic mixture of this (2R, αR) isomer and its (2S, αS) enantiomer. The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry of the two chiral centers is (R*, R*).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must now match our derived product with the given options.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) isomer (R on the ring, S on the side chain). This would be the minor product, derived from the *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **B) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) isomer (R on the ring, R on the side chain). This matches the stereochemistry of the major product we derived.\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. It is a fluoroalcohol, meaning the ketone did not fully react to a geminal difluoride, which is inconsistent with the use of excess DAST.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. It is a fluoroketone, meaning the ketone did not react at all.\n\n**Note on Nomenclature:** The options contain a common error, naming the product as a \"2,2-difluorocyclohexyl\" derivative. The reaction mechanism clearly forms a \"1,1-difluoro\" group with the side chain at C2. Assuming this is a typo in the question, the stereochemical descriptors are the deciding factor.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has the (R, R) relative stereochemistry, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** The reaction begins with cyclohexanone, which is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. The reaction is then quenched with acid.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA is a strong, bulky base that deprotonates the α-carbon of cyclohexanone to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is governed by the Zimmerman-Traxler transition state model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the major product is the ***anti***-diastereomer. This is due to steric factors where the bulky phenyl group of benzaldehyde preferentially occupies an equatorial position in the chair-like transition state. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α is the benzylic carbon).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Mechanism:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both the alcohol and ketone functional groups react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is converted to a geminal difluoride (CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol (-OH) at the α-position is converted to a fluoride (-F). This reaction (deoxyfluorination) proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2**\n\nTo find the stereochemistry of the major product, we trace the transformation of one of the enantiomers of the major *anti*-aldol product.\n\n1.  Start with the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer of Product 1.\n2.  React with excess DAST:\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the α-carbon undergoes inversion from (S) to **(R)**.\n3.  The resulting major product is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer (and its enantiomer, the (2S, αS) isomer). The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry is (R,R) or (S,S).\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with the correct functional groups (geminal difluoride and a single fluoride). It specifies the stereochemistry as **(R)** at the ring's chiral center (C2) and **(R)** at the benzylic chiral center. This matches the stereochemistry of the major product we derived. (Note: There is a common typo in such questions where the product `2-(side-chain)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane` is named as `...-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl...`. We focus on the stereochemistry, which is the intended point of the question).\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the (R,S) stereoisomer. This would be the minor product, arising from the minor *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **C) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The ketone group would have been converted to a geminal difluoride by the excess DAST.\n*   **D) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride (CF₂), not a fluoro-alcohol (-CF(OH)-).\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product of the reaction sequence has (R,R) stereochemistry, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   Acidification protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone, which is Product 1. The structure is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. This is because the transition state leading to the *anti*-product allows the bulky phenyl group to occupy a pseudo-equatorial position, which is sterically favored over the axial position required for the *syn*-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. For the next step, we will follow one of these enantiomers, for example, **(2R)-2-((S)-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups react.\n    *   It converts the ketone (C=O) at C1 to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   It converts the secondary alcohol (-OH) to a fluoride (-F). This reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:**\n    *   We start with the (2R, αS)-enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the stereocenter at C2, so its configuration remains **(R)**.\n    *   The fluorination of the secondary alcohol at the benzylic position (α-carbon) proceeds with inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  **Final Product:** The major product formed is the (2R, αR) stereoisomer (and its enantiomer, the (2S, αS) isomer). The key feature is that the relative stereochemistry of the two centers is (R*, R*).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the (R, R) stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer (Ring is R, benzylic is S). This is incorrect.\n*   **B) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) stereoisomer (Ring is R, benzylic is R). This matches our derived stereochemistry for the major product. (Note: There is a common typo in such questions where the product, 2-(side chain)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane, is named as a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl derivative. We focus on the stereochemical descriptors, which are the key to solving the problem).\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is an incorrect structure. Excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride (CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is an incorrect structure. Excess DAST would also have reacted with the ketone.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R, R) stereochemistry, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reagents:** The reaction begins with cyclohexanone, which is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by the addition of benzaldehyde. The reaction is completed with an acidic workup.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n    *   LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate.\n    *   This nucleophilic enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n    *   The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to yield a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters: C2 on the cyclohexanone ring and the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (let's call it Cα). The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. While the simple model for (Z)-enolates (like that from cyclohexanone) predicts *syn* selectivity, it is a well-documented exception that the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone reacts with benzaldehyde to give the ***anti***-diastereomer as the major product.\n    *   The *anti*-diastereomer is the racemic mixture of the **(2R, αR)** and **(2S, αS)** enantiomers. We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αR)**, through the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent is a key piece of information, indicating that it will react with all susceptible functional groups.\n    *   DAST converts ketones (C=O) to geminal difluorides (-CF₂).\n    *   DAST converts alcohols (-OH) to alkyl fluorides (-F). For secondary alcohols, this reaction typically proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Transformation of Product 1:**\n    *   The ketone group at C1 of the cyclohexanone ring is converted to a 1,1-difluoro group (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol group on the side chain is converted to a fluoride.\n4.  **Structure of Product 2:** The final product's constitution is **2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Stereochemistry of Product 2**\n\nWe trace the stereochemical changes from the major enantiomer of Product 1, the **(2R, αR)** isomer.\n\n*   The reaction at the C1 ketone does not affect the stereocenter at C2. Therefore, the C2 configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   The reaction at the Cα alcohol proceeds with inversion of configuration. Therefore, the **(R)** configuration at Cα is inverted to an **(S)** configuration.\n\nThe resulting major product is the racemic mixture of the **(2R, αS)** and **(2S, αR)** enantiomers.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (2R, αS) isomer. The `(R)` refers to the cyclohexyl ring stereocenter (C2), and the `(S)` refers to the fluoromethyl side chain stereocenter (Cα). This matches the major product we derived.

For the reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed under kinetic control is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an \"excess\" of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactions of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of excess reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at the C1 position is converted into a geminal difluoride (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol group (-OH) is converted into a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the stereocenter via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemical changes from the major *anti*-aldol product:\n    *   We start with the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) undergoes inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  **Final Product Structure:** The major product formed is the **(2R, αR)** stereoisomer (and its (S,S) enantiomer). The constitutional structure is 2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the **(R, R)** stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n*   **A) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes a molecule with an **(R)** configuration at the benzylic carbon (`(R)-...fluoromethyl`) and an **(R)** configuration at the ring carbon to which it is attached (`(R)-...cyclohexyl`). This corresponds to the **(R, R)** stereoisomer we predicted as the major product.\n*   **B) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. The ketone is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol.\n*   **C) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This describes the (R, S) stereoisomer. This would be the minor product, arising from the less-favored *syn*-aldol addition.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The ketone functional group would have been converted to a difluoride by the excess DAST.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence favors the formation of the *anti*-aldol product, which then undergoes fluorination with inversion of configuration at the alcohol center. This leads to a final product with (R, R) relative stereochemistry. Option A correctly describes this stereoisomer. (Note: The IUPAC name in the option likely contains a numbering error, \"2,2-difluoro\" instead of \"1,1-difluoro\", but the stereochemical descriptors are the key to differentiating the correct answer from the other plausible product, option C).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at a low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:** LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form a lithium enolate under kinetic control. This nucleophilic enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The subsequent acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction of a pre-formed lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde, under kinetic control (low temperature), is known to be diastereoselective, preferentially forming the *anti*-diastereomer. The *anti* product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. We will follow one of these enantiomers, for example, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**, as it proceeds to the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination)**\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST). DAST is a fluorinating agent.\n2.  **Mechanism:** The use of \"excess\" DAST ensures that both susceptible functional groups react.\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) at the C1 position of the cyclohexanone ring is converted into a geminal difluoride (CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol group (-OH) is converted into a fluoride (-F). This deoxyfluorination reaction with DAST proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** We trace the stereochemical changes from the major *anti*-aldol product:\n    *   Starting with the **(2R, αS)** enantiomer of Product 1.\n    *   The fluorination of the ketone at C1 does not affect the adjacent stereocenter at C2, so its configuration remains **(R)**.\n    *   The fluorination of the alcohol at the benzylic carbon (Cα) proceeds with inversion. Therefore, the **(S)** configuration inverts to an **(R)** configuration.\n    *   The resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The overall reaction produces a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe must find the option that matches the structure and stereochemistry of the major product, which has a relative (R*, R*) configuration.\n\n*   **A) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is incorrect. The ketone group would have been converted to a geminal difluoride by the excess DAST.\n*   **B) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This option describes the (2R, αS) stereoisomer. This is not the major product derived from the *anti*-aldol addition followed by inversion.\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. This structure is a fluoro-alcohol, which is not the final product when a ketone reacts with excess DAST.\n*   **D) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This option describes the (2R, αR) stereoisomer. This matches the stereochemistry of the major product derived from the *anti*-selective aldol addition followed by stereospecific inversion during fluorination.\n\nNote: There is a likely typographical error in the IUPAC names provided in options B and D. The reaction mechanism indicates the formation of a 1,1-difluorocyclohexane ring, but the options name it as a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl group. Assuming this is an error in the locant numbering, the stereochemical descriptors are the key to solving the problem. The (R, R) stereochemistry correctly identifies the major product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde and an acidic workup. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:** LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at an α-carbon to form a lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The subsequent acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler transition state model. For the reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers. To trace the stereochemistry, we will follow one of these enantiomers, for example, **(2R, αS)-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Function of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups—the ketone and the alcohol—will react.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) is converted to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂).\n    *   The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted to a fluoride (-F).\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Fluorination:** The fluorination of a secondary alcohol with DAST is a stereospecific reaction that proceeds with **inversion of configuration** (an Sₙ2-like mechanism). The conversion of the ketone at C1 to a difluoride does not affect the stereocenter at C2.\n\n### Determining the Final Stereochemistry\n\n*   We start with the major aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer.\n*   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected, so it remains **(R)**.\n*   The stereocenter at the alcohol (the α-carbon) has an (S) configuration. This center undergoes inversion during fluorination, so its configuration becomes **(R)**.\n*   Therefore, the major enantiomer of Product 2 has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The final product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αR) and (2S, αS) isomers.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nWe must find the option that corresponds to the (R, R) stereoisomer.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (Ring-R, Benzylic-S) isomer. This is not the major product.\n*   **B) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is an incorrect structure. Excess DAST converts the ketone to a geminal difluoride (-CF₂), not a fluoroalcohol.\n*   **C) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (Ring-R, Benzylic-R) isomer. This matches the stereochemistry of the major product derived from our analysis.\n*   **D) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is an incorrect structure. Excess DAST also reacts with the ketone.\n\n**Note on Nomenclature:** There is a likely error in the IUPAC names provided in options A and C. The reaction mechanism places the geminal difluoride at the C1 position (the original carbonyl carbon), so the correct name should be based on a \"1,1-difluorocyclohexyl\" group, not \"2,2-difluorocyclohexyl\". However, ignoring this common type of error in test questions, the stereochemical descriptors are the key to finding the correct answer.\n\nBased on the analysis, the major product has (R, R) stereochemistry, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Cyclohexanone is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde, and then acidified. This is a directed aldol addition reaction.\n2.  **Mechanism:** LDA, a strong and bulky base, deprotonates cyclohexanone at the α-carbon to form the kinetic lithium enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. An acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone.\n3.  **Structure of Product 1:** The product is **2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Product 1:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome is predicted by the Zimmerman-Traxler model. For the reaction of the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with an aldehyde, the major diastereomer formed is the ***anti***-product. The *anti*-product is a racemic mixture of the (2R, αS) and (2S, αR) enantiomers (where α refers to the benzylic carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). We will follow one of these enantiomers, **(2R, αS)**, through the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)\n\n1.  **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST).\n2.  **Reactivity of DAST:** DAST is a fluorinating agent. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both susceptible functional groups—the ketone and the alcohol—will react.\n    *   **Ketone Fluorination:** The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is converted into a geminal difluoride (-CF₂). This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at the adjacent C2 position.\n    *   **Alcohol Fluorination:** The secondary alcohol (-OH) is converted into a fluoride (-F). This reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** via an Sₙ2-like mechanism.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We trace the stereochemistry from the major *anti*-aldol product, the (2R, αS) enantiomer.\n    *   The stereocenter at C2 of the cyclohexane ring is unaffected and remains **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenter at the benzylic alcohol (α-carbon) undergoes inversion. The initial **(S)** configuration becomes **(R)**.\n4.  **Structure of Product 2:** The resulting product has the **(2R, αR)** configuration. The overall reaction produces a racemic mixture of this (2R, αR) product and its (2S, αS) enantiomer.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Options\n\nWe must find the option that corresponds to the (R, R) stereoisomer.\n\n*   **A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, S) stereoisomer (R at the ring, S at the side chain). This would be the minor product, derived from the *syn*-aldol adduct.\n*   **B) (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one:** This is an incorrect structure, as the ketone would have been fluorinated by the excess DAST.\n*   **C) (2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol:** This is an incorrect structure (a fluorohydrin), not the final product of the reaction with excess DAST.\n*   **D) ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene:** This name describes the (R, R) stereoisomer (R at the ring, R at the side chain). This matches the major product derived from our analysis.\n\nNote: There is a likely numbering error in the IUPAC names provided in the options. The reaction produces a 1,1-difluoro-2-substituted cyclohexane, not a 2,2-difluoro-1-substituted one.
