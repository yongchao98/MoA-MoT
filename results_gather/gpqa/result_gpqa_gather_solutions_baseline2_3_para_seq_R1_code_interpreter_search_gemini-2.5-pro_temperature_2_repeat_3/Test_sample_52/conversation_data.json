Here is a consolidated step-by-step breakdown that highlights the most critical points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Core and Key Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This immediately identifies a `C₆H₄` fragment as the molecular backbone, which accounts for 6 carbon and 4 hydrogen atoms. The ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with these 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester (`-COO-`). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** (`O₂`) present in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Elucidate the Substituents using ¹H NMR Data:**\n    This is the most crucial part of the problem, where the identity of the two substituents is determined.\n    *   **The Propenyl Group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**: The NMR signal description for the vinyl protons—\"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\"—is a definitive and unambiguous fingerprint for a propenyl group. The specific splitting arises from the coupling between the two vinyl protons and the coupling of one of them to the adjacent methyl group. This fragment accounts for one substituent, contributes a `C₃H₅` unit (3 carbons and 5 hydrogens), and uses up one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **The Methyl Ester Group (`-COOCH₃`)**: The problem states there are two signals for `-CH₃` groups and no signals for `-CH₂` groups.\n        *   One `-CH₃` is part of the propenyl group.\n        *   The second `-CH₃` must belong to the ester.\n        *   The constraint of \"no –CH₂ groups\" is key. It rules out other common ester types like ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second substituent must be a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). Both of these contribute `C₂H₃O₂` to the formula.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments to Calculate the Final Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified pieces, we can determine the molecular formula:\n    *   **From the aromatic ring core**: C₆H₄\n    *   **From the propenyl substituent**: C₃H₅\n    *   **From the ester/methyl substituent**: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    **Total Calculation:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 = **2**\n\n    The final, deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, is consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n    *   We can verify this with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE): DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This perfectly matches the DBE from the structure: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = 6.\n    *   Comparing our result to the options provided in the question:\n        A) C11H14O2\n        B) C12H12O2\n        C) C12H14O2\n        D) C11H12O2\n    *   The calculated formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a structural elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically breaking down the provided spectroscopic information to identify molecular fragments and then assembling them to determine the chemical formula. All candidate answers follow this correct logical procedure, demonstrating a strong consensus on the reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure:** The description specifies a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This establishes the presence of a benzene ring core where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**. The ¹H NMR confirms this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which accounts for the 4 protons on this ring.\n    *   **Fragments so far:** C₆, H₄\n\n2.  **Identify the Functional Groups:**\n    *   The **FTIR spectrum** shows an **ester group** (-COO-). This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the formula and also implies the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), which is a degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The **¹H NMR spectrum** shows signals for **two -CH₃ groups**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Substituents using NMR clues:** This is the most critical part of the analysis.\n    *   **Clue 1: Vinyl Protons.** The signal description \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" is a classic and definitive NMR pattern.\n        *   A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) means a proton is coupled to one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and three equivalent protons on a methyl group (giving the quartet).\n        *   The corresponding \"doublet\" (d) belongs to the other vinyl proton, which is coupled only to the first.\n        *   This pattern unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃)** as one of the substituents. This fragment has a formula of **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two -CH₃ signals.\n    *   **Clue 2: The Second Methyl Group and \"No -CH₂-\".** We have accounted for the ring (C₆H₄) and one substituent (C₃H₅). The second substituent must contain the ester group (-COO-) and the second -CH₃ group. The constraint that there are **no -CH₂- groups** is crucial. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). The only simple way to construct the ester with the second methyl group is as a methyl ester (e.g., **-COOCH₃**). This fragment has the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Assemble the Molecular Formula\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **Fragment 1 (Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Methyl Ester part):** C₂H₃O₂\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 = **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Verification and Final Answer\n\nWe can verify this with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):\n*   **From Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6\n*   **From Structure:** Benzene ring (4) + one C=C bond (1) + one C=O bond (1) = 6.\nThe calculation is consistent, confirming the result.\n\nComparing our derived formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** to the provided options:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical evidence is performed, taking into account the careful points raised in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identifying Molecular Fragments from Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe reasoning process involves breaking down the molecule into smaller, identifiable pieces based on the given spectral data.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. Two signals for these four protons are consistent with this structure. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* This fragment contributes 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms to the total formula.\n\n*   **Propenyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   *Careful Point:* This specific splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**. The \"doublet of quartets\" arises from the vinyl proton next to the methyl group being split by both the other vinyl proton and the methyl protons. The \"doublet\" arises from the other vinyl proton being split only by its vinyl neighbor.\n    *   This fragment contributes 3 carbon atoms and 5 hydrogen atoms (`C₃H₅`). It also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals mentioned in the data.\n\n*   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:**\n    *   The FTIR data confirms the presence of an **ester group (`-COO-`)**. This accounts for the 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   The ¹H NMR mentions \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups.\" We've already assigned one to the propenyl group.\n    *   *Careful Point:* A crucial piece of negative evidence is \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\" This rules out substituents like ethyl esters (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). In either case, this fragment contributes the ester's carbonyl carbon, the second methyl group, and the two oxygens, giving a formula of **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n**2. Assembling the Molecular Formula**\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete formula:\n*   **From the Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **From the Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **From the Ester/Methyl Fragment:** C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe derived molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3. Verification and Final Decision**\n\nTo confirm the result, we can check the degree of unsaturation (DBE), a method highlighted by several candidate answers.\n*   **DBE from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n*   **DBE from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\nThe perfect match confirms the consistency of the deduction.\n\nFinally, we compare the derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, with the options provided in the question:\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option A. All candidate answers correctly deduced the chemical formula through sound reasoning; the discrepancies in their final letter choices stemmed from different versions of the option list. Based on the list provided in the prompt, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous and correct logical process for determining the chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data. The slight discrepancies in the final letter choices among the agents are due to different ordering of the options in their respective inputs, but their chemical reasoning is consistently sound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the points that lead to the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Fragment (C₆H₄):** The information \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with the ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" correctly identifies a C₆H₄ core. This fragment contributes 6 carbon and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Ester Group (O₂):** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester group (`-COO-`), which accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the formula.\n\n3.  **Propenyl Group Fragment (C₃H₅):** The ¹H NMR data is most definitive here. The signal description for the vinyl protons—\"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\"—is a classic, unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. This fragment contributes 3 carbon atoms and 5 hydrogen atoms, and also accounts for one of the two specified `-CH₃` signals.\n\n4.  **Ester Substituent and Final Methyl Group (C₂H₃):**\n    *   The problem states there are two `-CH₃` signals. One is in the propenyl group.\n    *   The crucial negative evidence is \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"\n    *   This means the second `-CH₃` group must be attached to the ester functionality without any intervening `-CH₂-` groups. This points to a structure like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`).\n    *   This second substituent, therefore, contributes the atoms of the ester (`C` and `O₂`) and the final methyl group (`CH₃`).\n\n5.  **Assembling the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all identified fragments, we can calculate the final formula:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from aromatic ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester and its methyl group) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from aromatic ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's methyl group) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe deduced chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n6.  **Matching with the Given Options:**\n    The question provides the following choices:\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\n    The formula derived from the comprehensive analysis of the spectral data, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided information and the reasoning of the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step deduction to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Core:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This means the base structure is a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. This leaves a core fragment with the formula **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **NMR Confirmation:** The \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with the four protons remaining on this C₆H₄ ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups (FTIR & NMR):**\n    *   **FTIR:** An \"ester group\" is present. This confirms the molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group, accounting for the **2 oxygen atoms** seen in all options.\n    *   **NMR Methyl Groups:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups,\" indicating two chemically non-equivalent methyl groups in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Key NMR Splitting Pattern (The biggest clue):**\n    *   The \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" is a highly specific and informative pattern.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This pattern is a definitive signature of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.\n        *   The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only coupled to its neighbor, resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   This propenyl group fragment has a formula of **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n\n4.  **Apply the Critical Negative Evidence:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The information that there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is crucial. This rules out common structures like ethyl esters (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) or any other group containing a methylene (`-CH₂-`) bridge.\n    *   Since one substituent is the propenyl group, the other must be the ester. This ester must contain the *second* methyl group without introducing a CH₂ group. The only simple way to achieve this is to have a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH₃`). In either case, this fragment contributes a carbonyl carbon, a methyl carbon, three hydrogens, and two oxygens, giving a formula of **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Final Formula:**\n    We sum the atoms from all identified parts:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring Core:** C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Substituent:** C₃H₅\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Substituent:** C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Summing the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\n    The final, deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n6.  **Match with the Provided Options:**\n    The deduced formula must be compared to the choices:\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    The formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct chemical formula, a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data is required. All candidate answers follow a consistent and sound logical process, confirming the reliability of the deduction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This identifies the molecular core as a benzene ring with two substituents, for which the chemical formula is **C₆H₄**. This fragment accounts for 6 carbon and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **FTIR: \"ester group\"**: This confirms the presence of a `-COO-` functional group. This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** seen in all the options.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This confirms the 4 hydrogens on the C₆H₄ core. The presence of two signals for four protons implies a symmetrical substitution pattern (e.g., para).\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This is a highly characteristic splitting pattern that definitively identifies a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, giving a simple \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens) to the formula.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\"**: One methyl signal has already been assigned to the propenyl group. The second signal must come from the other substituent.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**: This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It means the second methyl group cannot be part of an ethyl or larger alkyl chain. Therefore, this methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a substituent like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    We have identified three main fragments:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: **C₆H₄**\n    *   Propenyl Group: **C₃H₅**\n    *   Methyl Ester Group (accounting for the ester and the second methyl): **C₂H₃O₂** (one C from the carbonyl, one from the methyl).\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   From the formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂`: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   From the structure: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\n    The perfect match in DBE confirms the analysis.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    The derived formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` must be compared to the provided list:\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C12H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\n    The calculated formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nA step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data is required to determine the chemical formula. All candidate answers correctly identify the same underlying molecular fragments and derive the same chemical formula, demonstrating a consistent and correct analytical process. The key points are as follows:\n\n**1. Identification of the Core Structure:**\n*   The description \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which corresponds to a molecular fragment of **C₆H₄**.\n*   The ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with the four protons on this C₆H₄ core, suggesting a symmetric substitution pattern.\n*   This core contributes **6 carbon** and **4 hydrogen** atoms.\n\n**2. Identification of the First Substituent (Propenyl Group):**\n*   The ¹H NMR signals for vinyl protons, specifically \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets,\" is a definitive fingerprint pattern.\n*   This pattern arises from a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl group's protons (quartet), forming the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, forming the \"doublet\".\n*   This fragment contributes **3 carbon** atoms and **5 hydrogen** atoms (`C₃H₅`). It also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n\n**3. Identification of the Second Substituent (Ester Group):**\n*   The FTIR data confirms an **ester group (`-COO-`)**, which contributes **2 oxygen** atoms.\n*   The ¹H NMR shows a second methyl (`-CH₃`) signal that must be part of this substituent.\n*   Crucially, the \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" constraint rules out larger alkyl chains (like an ethyl ester). This means the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`).\n*   This ester-containing fragment contributes **2 carbon** atoms (one carbonyl, one methyl), **3 hydrogen** atoms, and **2 oxygen** atoms (`C₂H₃O₂`).\n\n**4. Assembling the Final Formula:**\nBy summing the atoms from all identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5.

The correct formula is deduced by systematically breaking down the spectroscopic data into molecular fragments and then summing their atomic compositions. Here is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the most careful points from the reasoning.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure and Oxygen Content:**\n    *   The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This establishes the molecular core as a C₆H₄ fragment. The \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" in the ¹H NMR is consistent with the four protons on this ring.\n        *   **Fragment 1: C₆H₄ (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens)**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an \"ester group\" (R-COO-R'), which accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** present in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Elucidate the Substituents using ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group.** The ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" is a definitive signature. This unique splitting pattern unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. This group also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals mentioned.\n        *   **Fragment 2: C₃H₅ (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Ester and Second Methyl Group.** The data specifies \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\". One is in the propenyl group. The other must belong to the ester functionality.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: The \"No CH₂\" Constraint.** The fact that there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out longer alkyl chains like ethyl (`-CH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`).

This corresponds to a chemical fragment of **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **FTIR: ester group**: This confirms the presence of a `-COO-` functional group, which means the final formula must contain **2 oxygen atoms**.\n\n2.  **Detailed ¹H NMR Analysis (The Key to the Substituents):**\n    The proton NMR spectrum gives us the most specific information about the parts of the molecule containing hydrogen.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H**: This is consistent with the **4 hydrogens** on the C₆H₄ aromatic core. The presence of two signals for these four hydrogens suggests a symmetric arrangement of the substituents, such as 1,4- (para) disubstitution.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**: This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It rules out any fragments that contain a methylene (`-CH₂-`) group, such as an ethyl or propyl chain.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)**: This very specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, appearing as a \"doublet\". This fragment accounts for **C₃H₅**.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups**: We have now identified the source of both methyl groups:\n        1.  One methyl group is part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-**CH₃**`) fragment.\n        2.  The second methyl group must be part of the ester substituent. Combined with the \"no -CH₂-\" rule, this means it must be a simple methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). This fragment contributes a carbonyl carbon (`C=O`), the second methyl group (`CH₃`), and the two oxygens. The formula for this substituent is **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Final Formula:**\n    We can now sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to get the final molecular formula:\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Ester/Methyl Group):** C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Summing these up:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verification and Matching with Options:**\n    The calculated formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Now, we compare this to the provided options:\n    A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n    B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n\n    The derived formula matches option C. The reasoning is also confirmed by a Degree of Unsaturation calculation:\n    *   DBE for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 6.\n    *   The structure has an aromatic ring (4 DBE), a vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE), and an ester C=O double bond (1 DBE), for a total of 6 DBE. The consistency confirms the answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a systematic review of the reasoning provided by all candidate agents, a clear and unanimous conclusion can be reached. The process involves breaking down the provided spectroscopic data into molecular fragments and then reassembling them to find the correct chemical formula.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the careful points from the agents' reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The description \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with the ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" reliably identifies a **C₆H₄** fragment. This core accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Substituents from Spectra:**\n    *   **FTIR Data:** The presence of an \"ester group\" confirms a `-COO-` functional group, accounting for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the formula.\n    *   **¹H NMR Vinyl Signals:** The highly specific signal pattern for two vinyl protons—\"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\"—is a definitive signature of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **¹H NMR Methyl and Methylene Signals:**\n        *   The data specifies \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups.\" One is from the propenyl group, so there is another distinct `-CH₃` group.\n        *   Crucially, there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**. This piece of negative evidence is critical. It rules out longer alkyl chains like ethyl. The second methyl group must therefore be part of the ester, forming a **methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`)** or **acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`)** substituent. In either case, this fragment contributes 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified pieces, we can determine the final formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n    The logically deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verification:**\n    The conclusion is robust. We can verify the hydrogen count directly from the NMR assignments: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = 12 hydrogens. The Degree of Unsaturation for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is 6, which perfectly matches the structural components: 4 (ring) + 1 (C=C bond) + 1 (C=O bond).\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The analysis consistently and unambiguously points to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a structural elucidation problem that requires a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data.

This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**. The two signals for the four aromatic hydrogens in the ¹H NMR are consistent with this structure.\n        *   Atom Count: 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the **2 Oxygen atoms** in the formula and one C=O double bond.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals for vinyl protons, \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets,\" are a definitive fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**. The specific splitting pattern arises from the coupling between the two vinyl protons and the adjacent methyl group. This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n        *   Atom Count: 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens.\n    *   **Second Methyl Group & Absence of Methylene Groups:** The data states there are \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl group.\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester substituent.\n        *   The \"no –CH₂\" rule is a key piece of negative evidence. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). The only simple way to construct the ester is as a methyl ester (`–COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`–O-CO-CH₃`). Both structures add one methyl group and one carbonyl carbon to the total count, without adding any CH₂ groups.\n        *   Atom Count from this ester fragment: 2 Carbons (1 from C=O, 1 from -CH₃), 3 Hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can determine the complete formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 2 (from ester/methyl fragment) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from ester's methyl group) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify the Formula with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   **DBE from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6 DBE**.\n    *   **DBE from Formula:** For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, DBE = C + 1 – (H/2) = 11 + 1 – (12/2) = 12 – 6 = **6 DBE**.\n    *   The matching DBE values confirm the consistency between the proposed structure and the calculated formula.\n\n4.  **Match the Deduced Formula to the Given Options:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe only formula that matches the evidence derived from the spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous and correct line of reasoning for deducing the molecular formula from the provided spectroscopic data. The variations in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are due to different orderings of the options in each agent's context, but the chemical formula they derive is consistently the same. The following step-by-step analysis consolidates their logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Aromatic Core Identification:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons, and having only two signals is typical for a symmetric substitution pattern. This confirms the presence of a **C₆H₄** fragment.\n    *   Atoms accounted for: **6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens**.\n\n2.  **Ester Functional Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the **2 Oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n\n3.  **Side Chain Identification (from ¹H NMR):** This is the most crucial part of the deduction.\n    *   **The Propenyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This is an unambiguous, classic splitting pattern that definitively identifies a **propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for one of the two specified methyl group signals.\n        *   Atoms accounted for by this fragment: **3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **The Second Methyl Group & Ester:** The spectrum shows a second signal for a –CH₃ group. A critical piece of information is that there are \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**\". This constraint means the second methyl group cannot be part of an ethyl or larger alkyl chain. Therefore, the methyl group must be directly part of the ester, forming a fragment such as a **methyl ester (–COOCH₃)**.\n        *   Atoms accounted for by this fragment: **2 Carbons** (one carbonyl, one methyl), **3 Hydrogens** (from the methyl), and the **2 Oxygens** (from the ester).\n\n### Assembling the Final Formula\n\nWe now sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons:** 6 (from aromatic ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 2 (from ester/methyl part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from aromatic ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from ester's methyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Verification and Final Answer\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** Let's verify the result.\n    *   DBE calculated from the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n    *   DBE from the structure: 1 aromatic ring (4), 1 C=C double bond (1), and 1 C=O double bond (1) = 6.\n    *   The DBE values match, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural information.\n\n*   **Matching with Options:**\n    The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched to the provided options:\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C11H12O2\n    C) C12H12O2\n    D) C11H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided information and the reasoning from all candidate answers, the chemical formula can be definitively determined. The reasoning across all candidates is exceptionally consistent and logically sound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis, highlighting the careful points required to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The information \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" immediately establishes a core fragment of **C₆H₄**. The ¹H NMR data corroborates this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which is characteristic of the 4 protons remaining on such a ring.\n    *   *Contribution:* 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Functional Groups:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an **ester group (-COO-)**, which accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** seen in all the options. This also introduces a C=O double bond.\n\n3.  **Decode the Substituents with ¹H NMR:** The NMR data provides the most critical clues for identifying the two substituents on the ring.\n    *   **The Propenyl Group:** The signal description \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" is a textbook signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.\n        *   The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by its vinyl neighbor (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\".\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\".\n        *   This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **The Second Methyl Group and the Ester:** The NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\". Having assigned one to the propenyl group, the other must belong to the ester.\n    *   **The Power of Negative Information:** The crucial clue is **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a substituent like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`). Both of these fragments contribute **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula:** By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can calculate the total formula:\n    *   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester part)\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen:** 0 + 0 + 2 = **2**\n    *   The final, deduced formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The DBE for the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is `11 - (12/2) + 1 = 6`. This perfectly matches the DBE from the identified structure: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (C=C double bond) + 1 (C=O double bond) = 6.

This single fragment accounts for **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens** (2 vinyl H + 3 methyl H) and one of the two specified `-CH₃` groups.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The \"No -CH₂\" Rule.** The spectrum explicitly has \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\" This is crucial negative evidence. It eliminates the possibility of having longer alkyl chains like ethyl (`-CH₂CH₃`) attached to the ester or the ring.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: The Second Methyl Group.** The spectrum shows a second, distinct signal for a `–CH₃` group. Given the \"no -CH₂\" rule and the presence of an ester, this second methyl group must be part of the ester itself, forming a **methyl ester** (`-COOCH₃`) or **acetoxy group** (`-O-CO-CH₃`).

This fragment contributes **6 carbons** and **4 hydrogens**.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Substituent (Propenyl Group)**\n    *   **Data:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic and unambiguous fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. It also accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` signals mentioned.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The origin of the splitting is key to this deduction. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by both its neighboring vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, appearing as a \"doublet\".

The ¹H NMR shows a second `-CH₃` signal and, critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** The ester group accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms**. The second `-CH₃` group must be part of this substituent. The \"no -CH₂\" rule is the final clue; it eliminates structures like ethyl esters (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). The only simple way to satisfy all conditions is with a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH₃`) substituent.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Both possible ester fragments (`-COOCH₃` or `-OCOCH₃`) contribute the same number of atoms to the overall formula.

This accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Evidence:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an **ester group** (`-COO-`).\n    *   **Deduction:** This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the final formula and one degree of unsaturation (the C=O bond).\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Substituents from ¹H NMR Data:** This is the most crucial part of the analysis, where specific signal patterns reveal the exact structure of the attached groups.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group.**\n        *   **Evidence:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n        *   **Deduction:** This is a definitive and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (forming a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (forming a quartet), which combine to create a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, appearing as a simple \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens) and accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Second Methyl Group and Negative Evidence.**\n        *   **Evidence:** The spectrum shows a second signal for a `–CH₃` group. Critically, there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n        *   **Deduction:** This negative evidence is key. It rules out longer alkyl chains like an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`). Since one substituent is the propenyl group, the second substituent must contain the ester functionality and the second methyl group. The \"no -CH₂\" rule forces this to be a simple fragment like a **methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`)** or an **acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`)**. Both contribute the same number of atoms: 2 carbons (one C=O, one -CH₃) and 3 hydrogens.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, the complete molecular formula can be calculated.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring Fragment:** C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Group Fragment:** C₃H₅\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Fragment:** C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n\n    The final, logically deduced formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n    The result can be verified with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):\n    *   DBE from formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂): DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n    *   DBE from structure: 1 aromatic ring (4) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1) + 1 ester C=O bond (1) = 6.\n    The values match, confirming the result is self-consistent.\n\n    Comparing the derived formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** to the provided options:\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Here is a consolidated step-by-step breakdown that highlights the most critical points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Core and Key Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This immediately identifies a `C₆H₄` fragment as the molecular backbone, which accounts for 6 carbon and 4 hydrogen atoms. The ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with these 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester (`-COO-`). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** (`O₂`) present in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Elucidate the Substituents using ¹H NMR Data:**\n    This is the most crucial part of the problem, where the identity of the two substituents is determined.\n    *   **The Propenyl Group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**: The NMR signal description for the vinyl protons—\"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\"—is a definitive and unambiguous fingerprint for a propenyl group. The specific splitting arises from the coupling between the two vinyl protons and the coupling of one of them to the adjacent methyl group. This fragment accounts for one substituent, contributes a `C₃H₅` unit (3 carbons and 5 hydrogens), and uses up one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **The Methyl Ester Group (`-COOCH₃`)**: The problem states there are two signals for `-CH₃` groups and no signals for `-CH₂` groups.\n        *   One `-CH₃` is part of the propenyl group.\n        *   The second `-CH₃` must belong to the ester.\n        *   The constraint of \"no –CH₂ groups\" is key. It rules out other common ester types like ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second substituent must be a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). Both of these contribute `C₂H₃O₂` to the formula.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments to Calculate the Final Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified pieces, we can determine the molecular formula:\n    *   **From the aromatic ring core**: C₆H₄\n    *   **From the propenyl substituent**: C₃H₅\n    *   **From the ester/methyl substituent**: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    **Total Calculation:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 = **2**\n\n    The final, deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, is consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n    *   We can verify this with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE): DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This perfectly matches the DBE from the structure: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = 6.\n    *   Comparing our result to the options provided in the question:\n        A) C11H14O2\n        B) C12H12O2\n        C) C12H14O2\n        D) C11H12O2\n    *   The calculated formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a structural elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically breaking down the provided spectroscopic information to identify molecular fragments and then assembling them to determine the chemical formula. All candidate answers follow this correct logical procedure, demonstrating a strong consensus on the reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure:** The description specifies a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This establishes the presence of a benzene ring core where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**. The ¹H NMR confirms this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which accounts for the 4 protons on this ring.\n    *   **Fragments so far:** C₆, H₄\n\n2.  **Identify the Functional Groups:**\n    *   The **FTIR spectrum** shows an **ester group** (-COO-). This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the formula and also implies the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), which is a degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The **¹H NMR spectrum** shows signals for **two -CH₃ groups**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Substituents using NMR clues:** This is the most critical part of the analysis.\n    *   **Clue 1: Vinyl Protons.** The signal description \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" is a classic and definitive NMR pattern.\n        *   A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) means a proton is coupled to one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and three equivalent protons on a methyl group (giving the quartet).\n        *   The corresponding \"doublet\" (d) belongs to the other vinyl proton, which is coupled only to the first.\n        *   This pattern unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃)** as one of the substituents. This fragment has a formula of **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two -CH₃ signals.\n    *   **Clue 2: The Second Methyl Group and \"No -CH₂-\".** We have accounted for the ring (C₆H₄) and one substituent (C₃H₅). The second substituent must contain the ester group (-COO-) and the second -CH₃ group. The constraint that there are **no -CH₂- groups** is crucial. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). The only simple way to construct the ester with the second methyl group is as a methyl ester (e.g., **-COOCH₃**). This fragment has the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Assemble the Molecular Formula\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **Fragment 1 (Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Methyl Ester part):** C₂H₃O₂\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 = **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Verification and Final Answer\n\nWe can verify this with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):\n*   **From Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6\n*   **From Structure:** Benzene ring (4) + one C=C bond (1) + one C=O bond (1) = 6.\nThe calculation is consistent, confirming the result.\n\nComparing our derived formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** to the provided options:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical evidence is performed, taking into account the careful points raised in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identifying Molecular Fragments from Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe reasoning process involves breaking down the molecule into smaller, identifiable pieces based on the given spectral data.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. Two signals for these four protons are consistent with this structure. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* This fragment contributes 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms to the total formula.\n\n*   **Propenyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   *Careful Point:* This specific splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**. The \"doublet of quartets\" arises from the vinyl proton next to the methyl group being split by both the other vinyl proton and the methyl protons. The \"doublet\" arises from the other vinyl proton being split only by its vinyl neighbor.\n    *   This fragment contributes 3 carbon atoms and 5 hydrogen atoms (`C₃H₅`). It also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals mentioned in the data.\n\n*   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:**\n    *   The FTIR data confirms the presence of an **ester group (`-COO-`)**. This accounts for the 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   The ¹H NMR mentions \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups.\" We've already assigned one to the propenyl group.\n    *   *Careful Point:* A crucial piece of negative evidence is \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\" This rules out substituents like ethyl esters (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). In either case, this fragment contributes the ester's carbonyl carbon, the second methyl group, and the two oxygens, giving a formula of **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n**2. Assembling the Molecular Formula**\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete formula:\n*   **From the Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **From the Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **From the Ester/Methyl Fragment:** C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe derived molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3. Verification and Final Decision**\n\nTo confirm the result, we can check the degree of unsaturation (DBE), a method highlighted by several candidate answers.\n*   **DBE from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n*   **DBE from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\nThe perfect match confirms the consistency of the deduction.\n\nFinally, we compare the derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, with the options provided in the question:\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option A. All candidate answers correctly deduced the chemical formula through sound reasoning; the discrepancies in their final letter choices stemmed from different versions of the option list. Based on the list provided in the prompt, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous and correct logical process for determining the chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data. The slight discrepancies in the final letter choices among the agents are due to different ordering of the options in their respective inputs, but their chemical reasoning is consistently sound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the points that lead to the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Fragment (C₆H₄):** The information \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with the ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" correctly identifies a C₆H₄ core. This fragment contributes 6 carbon and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Ester Group (O₂):** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester group (`-COO-`), which accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the formula.\n\n3.  **Propenyl Group Fragment (C₃H₅):** The ¹H NMR data is most definitive here. The signal description for the vinyl protons—\"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\"—is a classic, unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. This fragment contributes 3 carbon atoms and 5 hydrogen atoms, and also accounts for one of the two specified `-CH₃` signals.\n\n4.  **Ester Substituent and Final Methyl Group (C₂H₃):**\n    *   The problem states there are two `-CH₃` signals. One is in the propenyl group.\n    *   The crucial negative evidence is \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"\n    *   This means the second `-CH₃` group must be attached to the ester functionality without any intervening `-CH₂-` groups. This points to a structure like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`).\n    *   This second substituent, therefore, contributes the atoms of the ester (`C` and `O₂`) and the final methyl group (`CH₃`).\n\n5.  **Assembling the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all identified fragments, we can calculate the final formula:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from aromatic ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester and its methyl group) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from aromatic ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's methyl group) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe deduced chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n6.  **Matching with the Given Options:**\n    The question provides the following choices:\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\n    The formula derived from the comprehensive analysis of the spectral data, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided information and the reasoning of the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step deduction to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Core:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This means the base structure is a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. This leaves a core fragment with the formula **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **NMR Confirmation:** The \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with the four protons remaining on this C₆H₄ ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups (FTIR & NMR):**\n    *   **FTIR:** An \"ester group\" is present. This confirms the molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group, accounting for the **2 oxygen atoms** seen in all options.\n    *   **NMR Methyl Groups:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups,\" indicating two chemically non-equivalent methyl groups in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Key NMR Splitting Pattern (The biggest clue):**\n    *   The \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" is a highly specific and informative pattern.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This pattern is a definitive signature of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.\n        *   The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only coupled to its neighbor, resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   This propenyl group fragment has a formula of **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n\n4.  **Apply the Critical Negative Evidence:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The information that there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is crucial. This rules out common structures like ethyl esters (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) or any other group containing a methylene (`-CH₂-`) bridge.\n    *   Since one substituent is the propenyl group, the other must be the ester. This ester must contain the *second* methyl group without introducing a CH₂ group. The only simple way to achieve this is to have a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH₃`). In either case, this fragment contributes a carbonyl carbon, a methyl carbon, three hydrogens, and two oxygens, giving a formula of **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Final Formula:**\n    We sum the atoms from all identified parts:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring Core:** C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Substituent:** C₃H₅\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Substituent:** C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Summing the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\n    The final, deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n6.  **Match with the Provided Options:**\n    The deduced formula must be compared to the choices:\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    The formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct chemical formula, a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data is required.

This fragment accounts for 6 carbon and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **FTIR: \"ester group\"**: This confirms the presence of a `-COO-` functional group. This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** seen in all the options.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This confirms the 4 hydrogens on the C₆H₄ core. The presence of two signals for four protons implies a symmetrical substitution pattern (e.g., para).\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This is a highly characteristic splitting pattern that definitively identifies a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, giving a simple \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens) to the formula.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\"**: One methyl signal has already been assigned to the propenyl group. The second signal must come from the other substituent.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**: This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It means the second methyl group cannot be part of an ethyl or larger alkyl chain. Therefore, this methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a substituent like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    We have identified three main fragments:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: **C₆H₄**\n    *   Propenyl Group: **C₃H₅**\n    *   Methyl Ester Group (accounting for the ester and the second methyl): **C₂H₃O₂** (one C from the carbonyl, one from the methyl).\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   From the formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂`: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   From the structure: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\n    The perfect match in DBE confirms the analysis.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    The derived formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` must be compared to the provided list:\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C12H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\n    The calculated formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nA step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data is required to determine the chemical formula. All candidate answers correctly identify the same underlying molecular fragments and derive the same chemical formula, demonstrating a consistent and correct analytical process. The key points are as follows:\n\n**1. Identification of the Core Structure:**\n*   The description \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which corresponds to a molecular fragment of **C₆H₄**.\n*   The ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with the four protons on this C₆H₄ core, suggesting a symmetric substitution pattern.\n*   This core contributes **6 carbon** and **4 hydrogen** atoms.\n\n**2. Identification of the First Substituent (Propenyl Group):**\n*   The ¹H NMR signals for vinyl protons, specifically \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets,\" is a definitive fingerprint pattern.\n*   This pattern arises from a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl group's protons (quartet), forming the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, forming the \"doublet\".\n*   This fragment contributes **3 carbon** atoms and **5 hydrogen** atoms (`C₃H₅`). It also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n\n**3.

The correct formula is deduced by systematically breaking down the spectroscopic data into molecular fragments and then summing their atomic compositions. Here is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the most careful points from the reasoning.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure and Oxygen Content:**\n    *   The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This establishes the molecular core as a C₆H₄ fragment. The \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" in the ¹H NMR is consistent with the four protons on this ring.\n        *   **Fragment 1: C₆H₄ (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens)**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an \"ester group\" (R-COO-R'), which accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** present in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Elucidate the Substituents using ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group.** The ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\" is a definitive signature. This unique splitting pattern unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. This group also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals mentioned.\n        *   **Fragment 2: C₃H₅ (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Ester and Second Methyl Group.** The data specifies \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\". One is in the propenyl group. The other must belong to the ester functionality.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: The \"No CH₂\" Constraint.** The fact that there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out longer alkyl chains like ethyl (`-CH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). In either case, this fragment contributes the same number of atoms.\n        *   **Fragment 3: C₂H₃O₂ (2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, 2 oxygens)**\n\n3.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2**\n    The final deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, is fully consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic data. The degree of unsaturation for this formula is 6, which perfectly matches the structure (1 aromatic ring = 4, 1 vinyl C=C = 1, 1 ester C=O = 1).\n    *   Comparing this formula to the options provided in the question:\n        *   A) C11H14O2\n        *   B) C12H12O2\n        *   C) C12H14O2\n        *   D) C11H12O2\n\n    The calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the spectroscopic data provided.\n\n### Analysis of the Molecular Structure from Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe problem requires us to deduce the molecular formula by piecing together fragments identified from the provided data.\n\n1.  **Core Structure and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This statement identifies the core of the molecule as a benzene ring with two other groups attached. This corresponds to a chemical fragment of **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **FTIR: ester group**: This confirms the presence of a `-COO-` functional group, which means the final formula must contain **2 oxygen atoms**.\n\n2.  **Detailed ¹H NMR Analysis (The Key to the Substituents):**\n    The proton NMR spectrum gives us the most specific information about the parts of the molecule containing hydrogen.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H**: This is consistent with the **4 hydrogens** on the C₆H₄ aromatic core. The presence of two signals for these four hydrogens suggests a symmetric arrangement of the substituents, such as 1,4- (para) disubstitution.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**: This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It rules out any fragments that contain a methylene (`-CH₂-`) group, such as an ethyl or propyl chain.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)**: This very specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, appearing as a \"doublet\". This fragment accounts for **C₃H₅**.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups**: We have now identified the source of both methyl groups:\n        1.  One methyl group is part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-**CH₃**`) fragment.\n        2.  The second methyl group must be part of the ester substituent. Combined with the \"no -CH₂-\" rule, this means it must be a simple methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). This fragment contributes a carbonyl carbon (`C=O`), the second methyl group (`CH₃`), and the two oxygens. The formula for this substituent is **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Final Formula:**\n    We can now sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to get the final molecular formula:\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Ester/Methyl Group):** C₂H₃O₂\n\n    Summing these up:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verification and Matching with Options:**\n    The calculated formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Now, we compare this to the provided options:\n    A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n    B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n\n    The derived formula matches option C. The reasoning is also confirmed by a Degree of Unsaturation calculation:\n    *   DBE for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 6.\n    *   The structure has an aromatic ring (4 DBE), a vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE), and an ester C=O double bond (1 DBE), for a total of 6 DBE. The consistency confirms the answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a systematic review of the reasoning provided by all candidate agents, a clear and unanimous conclusion can be reached. The process involves breaking down the provided spectroscopic data into molecular fragments and then reassembling them to find the correct chemical formula.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the careful points from the agents' reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The description \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with the ¹H NMR data showing \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" reliably identifies a **C₆H₄** fragment. This core accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Substituents from Spectra:**\n    *   **FTIR Data:** The presence of an \"ester group\" confirms a `-COO-` functional group, accounting for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the formula.\n    *   **¹H NMR Vinyl Signals:** The highly specific signal pattern for two vinyl protons—\"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\"—is a definitive signature of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **¹H NMR Methyl and Methylene Signals:**\n        *   The data specifies \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups.\" One is from the propenyl group, so there is another distinct `-CH₃` group.\n        *   Crucially, there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**. This piece of negative evidence is critical. It rules out longer alkyl chains like ethyl. The second methyl group must therefore be part of the ester, forming a **methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`)** or **acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`)** substituent. In either case, this fragment contributes 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified pieces, we can determine the final formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n    The logically deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verification:**\n    The conclusion is robust. We can verify the hydrogen count directly from the NMR assignments: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = 12 hydrogens. The Degree of Unsaturation for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is 6, which perfectly matches the structural components: 4 (ring) + 1 (C=C bond) + 1 (C=O bond).\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The analysis consistently and unambiguously points to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a structural elucidation problem that requires a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data. By carefully interpreting each piece of information, we can deduce the correct molecular formula.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis with careful points noted:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Given Information into Molecular Fragments:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This identifies the core as a benzene ring with two hydrogens replaced by other groups. This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**. The two signals for the four aromatic hydrogens in the ¹H NMR are consistent with this structure.\n        *   Atom Count: 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the **2 Oxygen atoms** in the formula and one C=O double bond.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals for vinyl protons, \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets,\" are a definitive fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**. The specific splitting pattern arises from the coupling between the two vinyl protons and the adjacent methyl group. This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n        *   Atom Count: 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens.\n    *   **Second Methyl Group & Absence of Methylene Groups:** The data states there are \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl group.\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester substituent.\n        *   The \"no –CH₂\" rule is a key piece of negative evidence. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). The only simple way to construct the ester is as a methyl ester (`–COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`–O-CO-CH₃`). Both structures add one methyl group and one carbonyl carbon to the total count, without adding any CH₂ groups.\n        *   Atom Count from this ester fragment: 2 Carbons (1 from C=O, 1 from -CH₃), 3 Hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can determine the complete formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 2 (from ester/methyl fragment) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from ester's methyl group) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify the Formula with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   **DBE from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6 DBE**.\n    *   **DBE from Formula:** For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, DBE = C + 1 – (H/2) = 11 + 1 – (12/2) = 12 – 6 = **6 DBE**.\n    *   The matching DBE values confirm the consistency between the proposed structure and the calculated formula.\n\n4.  **Match the Deduced Formula to the Given Options:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe only formula that matches the evidence derived from the spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous and correct line of reasoning for deducing the molecular formula from the provided spectroscopic data. The variations in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are due to different orderings of the options in each agent's context, but the chemical formula they derive is consistently the same. The following step-by-step analysis consolidates their logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Aromatic Core Identification:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons, and having only two signals is typical for a symmetric substitution pattern. This confirms the presence of a **C₆H₄** fragment.\n    *   Atoms accounted for: **6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens**.\n\n2.  **Ester Functional Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the **2 Oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n\n3.  **Side Chain Identification (from ¹H NMR):** This is the most crucial part of the deduction.\n    *   **The Propenyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".

This fragment accounts for one of the two specified methyl group signals.\n        *   Atoms accounted for by this fragment: **3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **The Second Methyl Group & Ester:** The spectrum shows a second signal for a –CH₃ group. A critical piece of information is that there are \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**\". This constraint means the second methyl group cannot be part of an ethyl or larger alkyl chain. Therefore, the methyl group must be directly part of the ester, forming a fragment such as a **methyl ester (–COOCH₃)**.\n        *   Atoms accounted for by this fragment: **2 Carbons** (one carbonyl, one methyl), **3 Hydrogens** (from the methyl), and the **2 Oxygens** (from the ester).\n\n### Assembling the Final Formula\n\nWe now sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons:** 6 (from aromatic ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 2 (from ester/methyl part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from aromatic ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from ester's methyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Verification and Final Answer\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** Let's verify the result.\n    *   DBE calculated from the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n    *   DBE from the structure: 1 aromatic ring (4), 1 C=C double bond (1), and 1 C=O double bond (1) = 6.\n    *   The DBE values match, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural information.\n\n*   **Matching with Options:**\n    The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched to the provided options:\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C11H12O2\n    C) C12H12O2\n    D) C11H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided information and the reasoning from all candidate answers, the chemical formula can be definitively determined.

Having assigned one to the propenyl group, the other must belong to the ester.\n    *   **The Power of Negative Information:** The crucial clue is **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a substituent like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`).

This fragment contributes **6 carbons** and **4 hydrogens**.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Substituent (Propenyl Group)**\n    *   **Data:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic and unambiguous fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. It also accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` signals mentioned.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The origin of the splitting is key to this deduction. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by both its neighboring vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, appearing as a \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Substituent (Ester/Methyl Group)**\n    *   **Data:** The FTIR shows an \"ester group\". The ¹H NMR shows a second `-CH₃` signal and, critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** The ester group accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms**. The second `-CH₃` group must be part of this substituent. The \"no -CH₂\" rule is the final clue; it eliminates structures like ethyl esters (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). The only simple way to satisfy all conditions is with a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH₃`) substituent.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Both possible ester fragments (`-COOCH₃` or `-OCOCH₃`) contribute the same number of atoms to the overall formula. This fragment provides **2 carbons**, **3 hydrogens**, and **2 oxygens**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula**\n    By summing the atoms from the three identified fragments, we can determine the complete formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester fragment) = **2**\n    *   The deduced chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verify Against Options**\n    The final step is to compare this formula to the options provided in the question:\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C11H12O2\n    C) C12H14O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ perfectly matches option B. Other options are inconsistent. For instance, C₁₁H₁₄O₂ has two extra hydrogens, which would require eliminating the vinyl C=C bond, contradicting the NMR data. The options with 12 carbons cannot be built from the fragments identified.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
