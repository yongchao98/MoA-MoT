    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State**:\n    The particle is spin-1/2 and its magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate of the `Sz` operator. The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -mu . B = - (gamma * Sz) * B`. Being \"aligned\" means the system is in the lower energy state, which for a spin-1/2 particle is the `spin-up` state along Z.\n    So, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`, which is the eigenvector of `Sz` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**:\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system is:\n    `H = -mu . B`\n    Here, `mu` is the magnetic moment vector operator, `mu = gamma * S`, where `S` is the spin vector operator `S = (Sx, Sy, Sz)`.\n    The new magnetic field is `B = B * y_hat` (where `y_hat` is the unit vector in the y-direction).\n    `H = - (gamma * S) . (B * y_hat) = -gamma * B * Sy`\n\n3.  **Time Evolution and Larmor Precession**:\n    The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H = -gamma * B * Sy`. Therefore, the state will evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation. This time evolution corresponds to the precession of the spin's expectation value `<S>` around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\n4.  **Equations of Motion (Heisenberg Picture)**:\n    A clear way to find the oscillation frequency is to look at the time evolution of the expectation values of the spin components using the Ehrenfest theorem, which leads to the classical equation of motion for the expectation values:\n    `d<S>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[S, H]>`\n    Substituting `H = -gamma * B * Sy`:\n    `d<Sz>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[Sz, -gamma*B*Sy]> = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * <[Sz, Sy]>`\n\n    Using the commutation relation for spin operators, `[Si, Sj] = iħ * ε_ijk * Sk`, we find:\n    `[Sz, Sy] = iħ * ε_zyx * Sx = iħ * (-1) * Sx = -iħ * Sx`\n\n    Substituting this back into the equation for `d<Sz>/dt`:\n    `d<Sz>/dt = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * (-iħ * <Sx>) = gamma * B * <Sx>` (Equation 1)\n\n    Similarly, we find the equation for `d<Sx>/dt`:\n    `d<Sx>/dt = (1/(iħ)) * <[Sx, -gamma*B*Sy]> = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * <[Sx, Sy]>`\n    The commutation relation is `[Sx, Sy] = iħ * Sz`.\n    `d<Sx>/dt = (-gamma*B/(iħ)) * (iħ * <Sz>) = -gamma * B * <Sz>` (Equation 2)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Oscillation Frequency**:\n    We now have a pair of coupled first-order differential equations. To solve for `<Sz(t)>`, we can differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = gamma * B * d<Sx>/dt`\n\n    Now, substitute Equation 2 into this new equation:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = gamma * B * (-gamma * B * <Sz>)`\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = -(gamma * B)² * <Sz>`\n\n    This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `x'' = -ω²x`. By comparing the two equations, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω`.\n    `ω² = (gamma * B)²`\n    `ω = gamma * B`\n\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's moment is `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <Sz(t)>`. Since `<Sz(t)>` oscillates with angular frequency `ω = gamma * B`, `<mu_z(t)>` will also oscillate with the same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
