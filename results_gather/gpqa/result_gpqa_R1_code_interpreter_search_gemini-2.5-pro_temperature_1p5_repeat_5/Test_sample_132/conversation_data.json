    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles for each salt added to the solution.\n\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass\n    *   Moles KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = mass / molar mass\n    *   Moles Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\nSince KH2PO4 completely dissociates to K+ and H2PO4-, the moles of H2PO4- are equal to the moles of KH2PO4.\nSince Na2HPO4●2H2O completely dissociates to 2Na+, HPO4^2-, and 2H2O, the moles of HPO4^2- are equal to the moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n\nNow, we calculate the concentrations using the total volume of the solution, which is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n\n*   Concentration of H2PO4- = moles / volume\n    *   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Concentration of HPO4^2- = moles / volume\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer solution.**\n\nThe solution is a buffer formed by the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-. This corresponds to the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid:\n\nH2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8. We can use the Ka2 expression to find the [H+]:\n\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nRearranging for [H+]:\n\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n[H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] ≈ 8.11x10^-8 M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration.**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). This corresponds to the third dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid:\n\nHPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12. The expression for Ka3 is:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can now solve for [PO4^3-] using the [H+] we just calculated and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-]. The change in [HPO4^2-] due to this third dissociation is negligible because Ka3 is very small.\n\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10^-8 M)\n\nTo perform this calculation accurately, let's use a script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations\nmoles_KH2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_KH2PO4 / volume_L\n\nmoles_Na2HPO4_2H2O = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_Na2HPO4_2H2O / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [H+]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f'{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}')\n```\n<execute_ipython>\n6.24e-07\n</execute_ipython>\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning behind the calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance.**\n    The problem gives the mass of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) and their molar masses. We can calculate the number of moles of each.\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Determine the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    When these salts dissolve in water, they dissociate completely.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O\n    The key species for the buffer are the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻) and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻).

We assume the initial concentrations are a good approximation of the equilibrium concentrations because it's a buffer.\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration.**\n    Now we use the Ka₃ expression and the calculated [H⁺] to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻].\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n\nThe python script executed in the initial reasoning confirms this calculation:\n```python\n# Constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations\nmoles_KH2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_KH2PO4 / volume_L\n\nmoles_Na2HPO4_2H2O = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_Na2HPO4_2H2O / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f'{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}')\n```\nThe output `6.24e-07` represents 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.
