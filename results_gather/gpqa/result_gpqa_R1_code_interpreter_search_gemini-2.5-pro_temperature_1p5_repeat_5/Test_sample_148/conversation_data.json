    "This problem requires a systematic evaluation of analytical chemistry data (NMR and LC-MS) to deduce the nature of a sample. Let's break down the evidence and evaluate each option.\n\n**Analysis of the Provided Data:**\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Integrals:** The peaks have roughly equal integrals that sum to one proton. This indicates there are two different chemical species present in an approximately 1:1 ratio, and in each species, that alpha-proton has a slightly different chemical environment.\n    *   **Coupling:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting is not due to neighboring protons. This reinforces the idea that two different molecular species are present.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n    *   **Intensities:** The peaks have equal intensities, which confirms the ~1:1 ratio of the two species observed in the NMR. The separation on LC means the two species have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), allowing them to be separated by the chromatography column.\n    *   **Mass Spectrum (MS):** Both LC peaks produce the exact same mass spectrum, and this mass corresponds to the expected molecule. This is a critical piece of information. It means the two species are isomers – they have the same atomic composition and molecular weight, but a different arrangement of atoms in space.\n    *   **Temperature:** The analysis was run at an \"elevated temperature,\" and the peaks remained \"clearly defined.\" This suggests that the two species are stable and do not easily interconvert, even with added thermal energy. If they were rapidly interconverting conformers, the peaks would likely broaden and coalesce at a higher temperature.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in each diastereomer would have different chemical shifts. A 1:1 mixture would show two peaks of equal intensity for a given proton. This perfectly matches the NMR data.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This explains the two LC peaks. As they are isomers, they have the same molecular weight, so they would give identical mass spectra. This perfectly matches the LC-MS data.\n    *   **How could they form?** This could happen if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks was not enantiomerically pure, or if racemization (epimerization) occurred at one of the chiral centers during the synthesis. Another common source in peptides is the presence of stable cis/trans isomers around an amide bond (e.g., involving proline), which are a form of diastereomers known as rotamers or atropisomers.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror-image stereoisomers. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   **NMR/LC:** Standard NMR and standard LC use achiral environments (solvents, columns). Therefore, they cannot distinguish between or separate enantiomers. A mixture of enantiomers would show only a *single* set of peaks in the NMR and a *single* peak in the LC. This contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n    *   This implies a side reaction where an extra amino acid or other group was added. This would result in a product with a different molecular formula and therefore a **different molecular weight**.\n    *   **MS:** The mass spectrum would be different from the expected molecule. The data clearly states both peaks have a mass spectrum consistent with the *expected* molecule. This option is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n*   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n    *   A precursor (starting material or intermediate) would almost certainly have a different chemical structure and **a different molecular weight** than the final product.\n    *   **MS:** Like option C, this would lead to a different mass spectrum. This is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that accounts for all the observations—two species in a 1:1 ratio that are separable by LC but have the same mass—is that the compound is a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
