    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let `S` be the inertial reference frame of the Galaxy (we can consider it stationary).\n    *   Let `S'` be the inertial reference frame of the supernova ejecta (we consider it the moving frame).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s` (approximately).\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (`S'`) is `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured in the rest frame of the \"clock\" (the ejecta itself), it is the proper time, `Δt₀`. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (`S`).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`S`).\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame `S` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` measured in the moving frame `S'` by the following equation:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, often denoted as `β` (beta):\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Now, calculate the time `Δt` that passes in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the numerical value, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the constants\nv = 60000  # speed of ejecta in km/s\nc = 300000  # speed of light in km/s\ndt0 = 50   # proper time in the ejecta's frame in seconds\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_sq = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / np.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"The calculated distance is: {distance} km\")\n```\nThe calculated distance is: 3061862.178478369 km\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Let's look at the given options:\n        A) 2,880,000 km\n        B) 2,940,000 km\n        C) 3,060,000 km\n        D) 3,000,000 km\n\n    *   The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to option C, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's design. For instance, if one uses the approximation `γ ≈ 1 + v²/(2c²)`, `γ ≈ 1 + (0.2)²/2 = 1.02`. Then `Δt = 1.02 * 50s = 51s`, and `d = 60,000 km/s * 51s = 3,060,000 km`, which matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere's the detailed breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy's reference frame be `S`. This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta's reference frame be `S'`. This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`S'`) is `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured by a clock at rest in the moving frame (`S'`), this is the proper time, denoted as `Δt₀`. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (`S`). This distance is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object as measured by a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame `S` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor `γ` (gamma):\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (`γ`):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.02062`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (`Δt`):**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (`d`):**\n    *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,860 km` is extremely close to option C, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nAs confirmed by the code execution, the precise distance is `3,061,862.178... km`, which again rounds most closely to `3,060,000 km`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
