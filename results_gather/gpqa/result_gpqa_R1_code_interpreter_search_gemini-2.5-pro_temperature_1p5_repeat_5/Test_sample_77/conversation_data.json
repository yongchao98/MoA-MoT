    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem Setup\n\n*   We have a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`.\n*   We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at an observation point `r` at time `t`.\n*   The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light `c`. This means the field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at some earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n*   At this retarded time `tr`, the charge was at position `s(tr)`.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is `v = ds/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   The vector from the source point `s(tr)` to the field point `r` is `d = r - s(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d|`.\n*   The time delay for the field to travel from `s(tr)` to `r` is `d/c`. This gives the fundamental relation for the retarded time:\n    `t = tr + d/c`  or  `t - tr = d/c = |r - s(tr)| / c`.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the potentials from a time-varying charge density `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')` are the **retarded potentials**:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c` is the retarded time for each source point `r'`.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` at position `s(t)` with velocity `v(t)`, the densities are expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for the scalar potential `V`:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(tr'))] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nThe integration is complicated because the retarded time `tr'` in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. Evaluating this integral properly (which involves a change of variables and a Jacobian determinant) yields a specific result known as the Liénard-Wiechert potential.\n\n### 4. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\nWhere all quantities on the right side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 5. Matching with the Given Options\n\nLet's manipulate the denominator of these expressions to match the form given in the options:\n\nThe denominator is `D = d - (d ⋅ v) / c`.\nWe can rewrite this by finding a common denominator:\n`D = (d*c - d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n    This can be written as:\n    `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n    This can be written as:\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Choices\n\nNow we compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) `V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀ r),  A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)`**: Incorrect. This is based on a static potential, ignoring retardation effects in the denominator.\n*   **B) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v)),  A(r,t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`**: This perfectly matches our derived expressions for both the scalar and vector Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **C) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d ⋅ v)),  A(r,t) = (μ qc v) / (4π (dc + d ⋅ v))`**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The minus sign accounts for the Doppler-like effect on the potential.\n*   **D) `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)`**: Incorrect. The formula for `V` is the static one. Although the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the `V` provided here is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
