    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is the apparent shift in the position of a celestial object when viewed from two different lines of sight. For stars, it's inversely proportional to their distance (`r`). The relationship is given by:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r`\n    or `r ∝ 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Use the given information about the number of stars and parallax.**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax as:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of distance.**\n    We want to find how the number of stars `N` depends on the distance `r`. We can substitute the relationship from step 1 into the equation from step 2. Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This means the *total* number of stars counted up to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of distance.**\n    The question asks for how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is equivalent to finding the density of stars as a function of distance, which is the derivative of the total number of stars `N(r)` with respect to the distance `r`. We need to calculate `dN/dr`.\n    If we let `N(r) = k * r^5` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality), then we can differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation:\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The result `dN/dr ∝ r^4` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
