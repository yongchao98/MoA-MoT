    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Problem Setup and Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero (V=0). The charge `q` induces a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the **Method of Images**. We can replace the grounded sphere and its complex surface charge distribution with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius r=R).\n\nFor a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` are given by:\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge position (from the center, along the same line as q): `d' = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is placed inside the sphere (`d' = R^2/d < R` since `d > R`), and it has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position `d` from the sphere's center.\n\nA key principle in electrostatics states that the potential energy of a charge `q` brought into a field that it itself induces on a linear medium (like a conductor) is given by:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the final location of `q` created by the induced charges.\n\n**3. Finding the Induced Potential (V_induced)**\n\nAccording to the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere's surface is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` for all points outside the sphere.\n\nTherefore, we need to calculate the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n*   The position of `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n*   The position of the image charge `q'` is at a distance `d' = R^2 / d` from the center.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `Δx = d - d'`.\n*   `Δx = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` is the potential due to `q'`:\n`V_induced = k * q' / Δx`\nwhere `k = 1 / (4πε₀)` is Coulomb's constant.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `q'` and `Δx`:\n`V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator's denominator cancels with the `d` in the denominator's denominator:\n`V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Calculation of Potential Energy (U)**\n\nNow we substitute this `V_induced` back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [- (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * (k * q^2 * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R²)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)          (Incorrect, has d in numerator and missing 1/2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)    (Correct, matches our derived formula)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)    (Incorrect, wrong numerator and denominator)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
