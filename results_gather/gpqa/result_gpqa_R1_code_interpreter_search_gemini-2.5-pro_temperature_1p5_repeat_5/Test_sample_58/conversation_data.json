    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the components of the mixture:**\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** A weak acid.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** A strong acid, which completely dissociates into H+ and Cl-.\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide):** A strong base, which completely dissociates into Ba2+ and 2 OH-.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant (acids and base):**\nThe formula to calculate moles is: `Moles = Molarity (M) × Volume (L)`\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, moles of H+ = 0.080 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-, moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n**3. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\nThe strong base (OH-) will first react with the strong acid (H+ from HCl), and then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Step 3a: Reaction between strong acid and strong base**\n    *   Reactants: 0.080 mol H+ and 0.180 mol OH-\n    *   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   H+ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = (Initial moles of OH-) - (Moles of H+ reacted)\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Step 3b: Reaction between remaining strong base and weak acid**\n    *   Reactants: 0.100 mol OH- and 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n    *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   CH3COOH is the limiting reactant here. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of excess OH- = (Moles of OH- from Step 3a) - (Moles of CH3COOH reacted)\n    *   Moles of excess OH- = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**4. Determine the composition of the final solution:**\nAfter all reactions are complete, the solution contains:\n*   Excess OH-: 0.050 mol (This is a strong base and will primarily determine the pH).\n*   CH3COO- (acetate ion): 0.050 mol (This is a weak base, but its contribution to the pH is negligible in the presence of a strong base).\n*   Spectator ions: Cl- and Ba2+.\n\n**5. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH- and the pH:**\n\n*   **Step 5a: Calculate the total volume of the solution**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Step 5b: Calculate the final concentration of OH-**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Step 5c: Calculate the pOH**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Step 5d: Calculate the pH**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH is: pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial moles\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500  # Moles of weak acid\nmoles_h_strong = 0.2 * 0.400  # Moles of H+ from strong acid\nmoles_oh_strong = 0.3 * 0.300 * 2  # Moles of OH- from strong base\n\n# Step 3a: React strong acid and strong base\nmoles_oh_after_hcl_reaction = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong\n\n# Step 3b: React remaining strong base with weak acid\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_hcl_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 5a: Calculate total volume\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\n\n# Step 5b: Calculate final concentration of excess OH-\nconcentration_oh = moles_oh_excess / total_volume_L\n\n# Step 5c: Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(concentration_oh)\n\n# Step 5d: Calculate pH\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f'{pH=}')\n```\nExecution of the code gives the following result:\npH=12.619788758288394\n\nRounding the result to two decimal places gives 12.62. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem involves the reaction between a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). To find the final pH, we need to determine which species is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of H+ and OH- ions:**\n\n*   **From the strong acid (HCl):**\n    HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates.\n    Moles of H+ = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol H+\n\n*   **From the weak acid (CH3COOH):**\n    Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **From the strong base (Ba(OH)2):**\n    Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates to give two OH- ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    Moles of OH- = Molarity × Volume × 2 = 0.3 M × 0.300 L × 2 = 0.180 mol OH-\n\n**2. Perform Neutralization Reactions:**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will react completely with the strong acid (H+ from HCl) first. Then, any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Reaction between strong acid and strong base**\n    *   Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H+ ions will be completely neutralized by the OH- ions.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Step 2b: Reaction between remaining strong base and weak acid**\n    *   Now, the remaining 0.100 mol of OH- reacts with the 0.050 mol of CH3COOH.\n    *   The CH3COOH will be completely neutralized.\n    *   Moles of excess OH- = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Final pH:**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- ions. This excess strong base will determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-:**\n    [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH + pOH = 14\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
