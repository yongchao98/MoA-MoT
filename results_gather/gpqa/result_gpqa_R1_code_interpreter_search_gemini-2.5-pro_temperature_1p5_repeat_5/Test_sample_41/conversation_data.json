    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of an exoplanet in a circular orbit around its star is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^0.5 * (1 - A)^0.25\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the distance from the star).\n    *   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n    For a given star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem states that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the formula simplifies to show that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/a)^0.5\n\n2.  **Relate Temperature Ratios to Orbital Distance Ratios:**\n    Using the proportionality from step 1, we can set up ratios for the planets.\n    For Planet1 and Planet2:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^0.5\n    We are given T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4.\n    So, (a2 / a1) = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 = 1.4^2 = 1.96.\n\n    For Planet2 and Planet3:\n    T_eq2 / T_eq3 = (a3 / a2)^0.5\n    We are given T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3.\n    So, (a3 / a2) = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Overall Orbital Distance Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (a3 / a1). We can do this by multiplying the two ratios we just found:\n    a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1)\n    a3 / a1 = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684.\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\n    P^2 ∝ a^3\n    Therefore, the ratio of the periods can be expressed as:\n    (P3 / P1)^2 = (a3 / a1)^3\n    P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n\n    *Note: The information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method is extra detail. While a more precise form of Kepler's Law includes the mass of the planets (P^2 ∝ a^3 / (M_star + M_planet)), the mass of an exoplanet is typically negligible compared to its star's mass. Thus, this correction factor is extremely close to 1 and does not significantly affect the result. This information can be considered extraneous for this problem.*\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio:**\n    Now, substitute the value of (a3 / a1) into the equation from step 4.\n    P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n    To calculate this, we can run a simple python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet3 to Planet1 was found to be 10.3684\na_ratio_31 = 10.3684\n\n# According to Kepler's Third Law, the ratio of the orbital periods is (a_ratio)^(3/2)\nP_ratio_31 = a_ratio_31**(3/2)\n\nprint(P_ratio_31)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 33.4.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 4.4\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is related to its distance from the star (the semi-major axis, `a`). The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a})^{0.5} \\times (1 - A)^{0.25}$\n    Where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the star's temperature and radius (constants for this system).\n    *   `A` is the albedo (given as the same for all planets).\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    Since all other terms are constant for the planets in this system, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-0.5}$\n\n2.  **Use the Temperature Ratios to Find Ratios of Orbital Distances:**\n    From the relationship above, we can write the ratio of temperatures for two planets (e.g., Planet X and Planet Y) as:\n    $\\frac{T_{eqX}}{T_{eqY}} = \\frac{(a_X)^{-0.5}}{(a_Y)^{-0.5}} = (\\frac{a_Y}{a_X})^{0.5}$\n    By squaring both sides, we can find the ratio of their orbital distances:\n    $\\frac{a_Y}{a_X} = (\\frac{T_{eqX}}{T_{eqY}})^2$\n\n    *   **For Planet 1 and Planet 2:**\n        We are given $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 1.4$.\n        So, the ratio of their distances is:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}})^2 = 1.4^2 = 1.96$\n\n    *   **For Planet 2 and Planet 3:**\n        We are given $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\approx 2.3$.\n        So, the ratio of their distances is:\n        $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = (\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}})^2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Overall Orbital Distance Ratio (Planet 3 vs. Planet 1):**\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$), we can multiply the two ratios we just calculated:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This means the ratio of the periods for two planets is:\n    $(\\frac{P_3}{P_1})^2 = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^3$\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^{3/2}$\n\n    *(Note: The information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method is irrelevant to this calculation, as the mass of the planets is negligible compared to the star's mass and does not significantly affect the orbital period in this context.)*\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Orbital Period Ratio:**\n    Now we substitute the value of $\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$ we found in step 3 into the equation from step 4.\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}$\n    The python code calculated this value as `33.386...`\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # The ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet3 to Planet1 was found to be 10.3684\n    a_ratio_31 = 10.3684\n\n    # According to Kepler's Third Law, the ratio of the orbital periods is (a_ratio)^(3/2)\n    P_ratio_31 = a_ratio_31**(3/2)\n\n    print(P_ratio_31)\n    ```\n    \n    The result `33.386` is approximately 33.4. This means the orbital period of Planet 3 is about 33.4 times larger than that of Planet 1.\n\n    Comparing this to the options:\n    A) ~ 3.2\n    B) ~ 33.4\n    C) ~ 10.4\n    D) ~ 4.4\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
