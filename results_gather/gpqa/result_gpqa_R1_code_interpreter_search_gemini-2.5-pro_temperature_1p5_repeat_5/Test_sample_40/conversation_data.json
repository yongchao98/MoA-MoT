    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two main inertial frames of reference.\n    *   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the frame where the observer is at rest. In this frame, the glass is observed to be moving with a velocity `v`.\n    *   **The Glass's Rest Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is stationary.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocities in Each Frame:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab:** The problem states this is `v`. This is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the glass's rest frame (S'):** The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, the speed of the light beam as measured within the glass (in its own rest frame S') is `u' = 1/n`. The light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass, so we take this velocity as positive.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:** To find the speed of light `u` as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S), we cannot simply add the velocities classically (i.e., `u = v + 1/n`). We must use the Einstein relativistic velocity addition formula. For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the laboratory frame S.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in the moving frame S' (the glass's frame).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame S' relative to the laboratory frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these values into the velocity addition formula:\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both the top and bottom of the expression by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    Distribute `n` into the parentheses:\n\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option B.\n\nThis result is a famous experimental confirmation of special relativity, known as the Fizeau experiment concerning the Fresnel drag coefficient.\n\n<<<B>>>"
