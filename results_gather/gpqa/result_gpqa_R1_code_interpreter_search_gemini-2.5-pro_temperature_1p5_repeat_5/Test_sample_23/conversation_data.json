    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (y * mass_H) / (x * mass_C + y * mass_H).\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the fraction is y / (12x + y).\n    *   Setting this equal to 14.28% or 0.1428:\n        y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7\n        7y = 12x + y\n        6y = 12x\n        y = 2x\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general molecular formula is CnH2n. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. Alkenes react with hydrogen (hydrogenation), but saturated cycloalkanes do not (under most conditions). Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent and is a liquid. The most common cycloalkane that fits this description is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's check the mass percent for C6H12 with more precise atomic masses (C≈12.01, H≈1.01):\n        Mass of H = 12 * 1.01 = 12.12\n        Mass of C = 6 * 12.01 = 72.06\n        Total Mass = 84.18\n        %H = (12.12 / 84.18) * 100% ≈ 14.4%, which is close to 14.28%. The y=2x relationship is very strong.\n    *   The entire reaction scheme involves conversions that give a single product Z upon hydrogenation. This strongly implies all key compounds (A, B, C, D) share the same carbon skeleton, which is the C6 skeleton of cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane, C6H12**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenating it gives itself.\n    *   Now for substance D: It must be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12), meaning it has a C6 skeleton. It must not decolorize bromine water. The most common compound fitting this description is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water (without a catalyst) and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   So, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation from X to Y**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of liquids A and B) is converted to mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) upon heating with platinum.\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it implies a hydrogen transfer reaction where one species is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The overall reaction can be written as a 1:1 reaction between the components of the equimolar mixture X to form the components of the equimolar mixture Y:\n        A + B → C + D\n        A + B → C6H12 + C6H6\n    *   All compounds (A, B, C, D) have a C6 skeleton. Let the formula for A be C6Ha and for B be C6Hb.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of atoms, the number of hydrogen atoms must be equal on both sides of the equation:\n        Number of H in (A + B) = Number of H in (C6H12 + C6H6)\n        a + b = 12 + 6\n        a + b = 18\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n    *   From our analysis, this sum is a + b, which we calculated to be 18.\n\n5.  **Consistency Check**\n    *   Does mixture X decolorize bromine water? This means A or B (or both) must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   Are there no conjugated multiple bonds in X?\n    *   Let's find plausible structures for A and B. We need two C6 cyclic hydrocarbons (that hydrogenate to cyclohexane) with a total of 18 hydrogens. A good candidate pair would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   a = 10, b = 8. So a + b = 18. This fits.\n        *   Both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated). This fits the condition. 1,3-cyclohexadiene would be ruled out because it is conjugated.\n        *   The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: C6H10 (acceptor) + C6H8 (donor) → C6H12 + C6H6. This is a known type of reaction.\n    *   The existence of this plausible pair confirms our reasoning is sound. The core calculation (a+b=18) is independent of finding the exact structures but is reinforced by it.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>"
