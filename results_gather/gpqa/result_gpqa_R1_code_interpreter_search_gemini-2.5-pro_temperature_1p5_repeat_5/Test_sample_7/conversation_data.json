As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Role of Gene G2\n\n*   **Single mutant `g2`:** The resistance level is 0%. This indicates that the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for any resistance to the pathogen.\n*   **Double mutants with `g2`:**\n    *   `g1g2` resistance is 0%.\n    *   `g2g3` resistance is 0%.\n*   **Genetic Principle: Epistasis.** Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another gene. The phenotype of the double mutant `g1g2` (0% resistance) is identical to the phenotype of the single mutant `g2` (0% resistance). This means the `g2` mutation is epistatic to the `g1` mutation. Similarly, because the `g2g3` phenotype (0%) is the same as the `g2` phenotype (0%), `g2` is also epistatic to `g3`.\n*   **Biological Interpretation:** In a genetic pathway, an upstream gene is often epistatic to a downstream gene. Because G2's phenotype masks both G1's and G3's, it is the most upstream element in this pathway. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream. The epistatic nature and the complete loss of function make G2 the strongest candidate for this upstream transcription factor, which likely activates G1, G3, and possibly other genes required for resistance.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Interaction between Gene G1 and Gene G3\n\n*   **Single mutants:**\n    *   `g1`: 75% resistance (a loss of 25% compared to control).\n    *   `g3`: 50% resistance (a loss of 50% compared to control).\n*   **Double mutant `g1g3`:** The resistance is 10% (a loss of 90% compared to control).\n*   **Genetic Principle: Gene Interaction.** Let's consider the expected outcome if the genes acted independently.\n    *   **Additive effect:** If their effects were simply additive, the expected loss of resistance in the double mutant would be the sum of individual losses: 25% (from `g1`) + 50% (from `g3`) = 75% loss. This would result in 25% resistance.\n    *   **The observed result:** The actual loss is 90%, which is significantly greater than the expected 75% loss from a simple additive model. This type of interaction, where the phenotype of the double mutant is much more severe than expected, is called **synergistic interaction**.\n*   **Biological Interpretation:** A common cause of synergistic interaction is **gene redundancy**. This means that G1 and G3 perform similar or overlapping functions in the resistance pathway (they are likely both activated by G2). While losing one of them reduces resistance, the other can partially compensate. However, losing both genes leads to a near-total collapse of their combined function, resulting in a much more severe phenotype. Therefore, G1 and G3 exhibit partial gene redundancy.\n*   **Epistasis Check:** Can G1 be epistatic to G3, or vice-versa?\n    *   If G1 were epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). This is not true.\n    *   If G3 were epistatic to G1, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would be the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%). This is also not true.\n    *   Therefore, neither G1 nor G3 is epistatic to the other.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Answer Choices\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on our conclusions:\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct.\n    *   `same promoter`: Plausible mechanism for co-regulation by G2, but not directly proven.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. This is the best description for their synergistic interaction.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. This part of the statement is flawed. However, the other two parts are the most accurate descriptions of the experimental results.\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a TF`: Incorrect. The data strongly points to G2 being the upstream TF.\n    *   `pleiotropy`: Not the best term. We are only measuring one trait. \"Gene redundancy\" is more accurate.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: Correct, but the first statement is wrong.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct.\n    *   `pleiotropy`: Incorrect term to describe the observed interaction.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B contains the two most accurate and significant conclusions drawn from the experiment: G2 acts as an upstream transcription factor, and G1 and G3 have redundant functions. Although the third clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on the standard definition of epistasis, Option B is by far the best description of the genetic network among the choices provided. The error in the last clause is likely a mistake in the question's construction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
