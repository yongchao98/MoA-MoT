    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state 'b' ($N_b$) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state 'a' ($N_a$) is given by:\n    $N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T))$\n    where:\n    *   $g_b$ and $g_a$ are the degeneracies (statistical weights) of the energy levels.\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_b - E_a$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Translate the problem statement into an equation:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of populations ($N_b/N_a$) for the given energy levels in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let $T_1$ be the temperature of star_1 and $T_2$ be the temperature of star_2. We can write this as:\n    $(N_b / N_a)_{star\\_1} = 2 \\times (N_b / N_a)_{star\\_2}$\n\n4.  **Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star:**\n    *   For star 1 (temperature $T_1$):\n        $(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))$\n    *   For star 2 (temperature $T_2$):\n        $(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 3:**\n    $(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)) ]$\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term $(g_b/g_a)$ represents the properties of the specific iron transition and is the same for both stars. Therefore, it can be cancelled from both sides of the equation:\n    $exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    $ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n\n    Using the logarithm properties $ln(e^x) = x$ and $ln(a \\cdot b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$:\n    $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n    $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_2)$\n\n8.  **Isolate the ln(2) term:** Rearrange the equation to solve for $ln(2)$:\n    $ln(2) = \\Delta E / (k * T_2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_1)$\n\n9.  **Factor and combine terms:** Factor out the common term $\\Delta E / k$ and combine the fractions involving temperature:\n    $ln(2) = (\\Delta E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)$\n    $ln(2) = (\\Delta E / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]$\n\n10. **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference, $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant is $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\n    Calculate the ratio $\\Delta E / k$:\n    $\\Delta E / k \\approx (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}) / (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}) \\approx 1 \\text{ K}$\n\n    Substituting this value into our equation:\n    $ln(2) = (1 \\text{ K}) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]$\n\n    This step is slightly confusing with units, but in the exponent term $-\\Delta E/(kT)$, the units must cancel. So if $\\Delta E$ is in Joules and $T$ is in Kelvin, $k$ must be in J/K. The quantity $\\Delta E/k$ has units of Kelvin. The term in the parentheses $(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)$ has units of $1/K$. The product is therefore dimensionless, which is correct since $ln(2)$ is a dimensionless number. The numerical value of the factor $\\Delta E/k$ is 1.\n\n    So, the final equation is:\n    $ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]$\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:** The derived equation matches option D.\n\nA) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect.\nB) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect.\nC) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect.\nD) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
