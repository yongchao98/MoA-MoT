    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggests the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group in the molecule.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum provides direct confirmation of the alkene functional group that was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n    *   Mass = (1 x mass of C) + (2 x mass of O) + (1 x mass of H)\n    *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponding to [COOH]⁺ is a very common and diagnostically significant fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options**\n\n*   From the combined spectroscopic evidence, we can definitively say that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n*   We are left with two options: C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. To distinguish between them, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C - (H/2) + 1` (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option C):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**\n    *   A DoU of 1 means there is one double bond or one ring. The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group accounts for this single degree of unsaturation. This formula would correspond to a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option B):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**\n    *   A DoU of 2 is required to account for two double bonds. Our spectroscopic analysis identified one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. This formula perfectly matches all the evidence.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence from all three techniques points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
