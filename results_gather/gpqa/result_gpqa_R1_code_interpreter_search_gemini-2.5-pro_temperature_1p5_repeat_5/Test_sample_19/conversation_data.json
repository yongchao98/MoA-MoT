    "This question asks to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in the context of many-body nuclear physics. Let's analyze each statement to understand its role.\n\n**The Impulse Approximation**\nThe central idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify the complex interaction of a probe (like an electron or a neutrino) with a nucleus, which is a bound system of many nucleons (protons and neutrons). The name \"impulse\" suggests an interaction that is very rapid, like a sudden strike. In such a brief interaction, the complex forces that bind the struck nucleon to its neighbors can be momentarily ignored. The nucleon is treated as if it were a free particle at the moment of the interaction.\n\nLet's evaluate the four proposed assumptions in this light:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the first step in simplifying the problem. Instead of considering a complicated interaction with the nucleus as a whole or with clusters of nucleons, the approximation assumes the probe interacts cleanly with just one constituent nucleon. This is a foundational assumption.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption deals with the \"initial state\" and \"final state\" of the interaction. It posits that the incoming probe travels to the target nucleon without being deflected or interacting with other nucleons, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) exit the nucleus without further interactions. This is often called the \"Plane Wave Impulse Approximation\" (PWIA). While more advanced models (like the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation, DWIA) try to correct for this, it is a core assumption of the basic impulse approximation.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is about how a nucleon behaves *within the nucleus* during an external interaction. The model used to describe the nucleon's internal quark structure (whether relativistic or non-relativistic) is a separate issue. For example, one could use the impulse approximation to describe electron-nucleus scattering while simultaneously using a relativistic model for the nucleon's form factors. Therefore, this assumption is not a defining characteristic of the impulse approximation itself.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction is assumed to be so fast that the binding potential holding the nucleon within the nucleus does not have time to act. During the brief moment of the collision, the nucleon behaves like a free particle, not a particle in a potential well.\n\n**Conclusion**\nCombining these insights, the impulse approximation is defined by:\n-   An interaction with a single nucleon (Assumption 1).\n-   Neglecting the nucleon's binding forces during this interaction (Assumption 4).\n-   The absence of interactions between the probe/ejectiles and the other \"spectator\" nucleons (Assumption 2).\n\nTherefore, assumptions 1, 2, and 4 jointly constitute the impulse approximation. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
