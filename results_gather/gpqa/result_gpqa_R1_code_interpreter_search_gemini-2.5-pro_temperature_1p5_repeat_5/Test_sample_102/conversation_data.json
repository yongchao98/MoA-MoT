    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Parent:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Structure and Directing Effects:**\n    *   The substituents are all in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n    *   -COCH3 is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   -NO2 is a strong deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   -Br is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider adding the three groups directly to benzene.\n*   **Problem:** It's very difficult to add three groups in a 1,3,5-pattern when they don't all direct to the same places. More importantly, Friedel-Crafts reactions, like the acylation needed to add the -COCH3 group (CH3COCl/AlCl3), fail on strongly deactivated rings. If we add the -NO2 and -Br groups first, the ring becomes too deactivated for the final acylation step.\n*   **Route 1:** Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. (OK)\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group is a meta-director, so this works well).\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → Target. (The -COCH3 and -NO2 groups are both meta-directors. They both direct the incoming Br+ to position 5. The regiochemistry is perfect).\n*   **Potential Flaw:** The final bromination step is performed on a ring with two deactivating groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). This makes the ring very unreactive towards electrophilic substitution. While the selectivity is good, the reaction rate is very low, and standard conditions (Br2/FeBr3) give very poor yields (reported as ~11%). Achieving a \"high-yield\" requires very harsh, specific conditions not implied by the question's reagents. Therefore, this simple route is likely not the intended answer for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate Indirect Synthesis Routes (The \"Amino Group\" Strategy)**\n\nThe presence of reagents for reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a more sophisticated strategy. This strategy involves:\n1.  Introducing an amino group (-NH2), usually from a nitro group.\n2.  Using the powerful ortho, para-directing effect of the amino group (or its protected form, acetamido -NHCOCH3) to place other substituents.\n3.  Removing the amino group via diazotization and deamination.\n\nThis is a classic method for synthesizing substitution patterns that are otherwise inaccessible.\n\n**4. Analyze the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace each option to see if it follows a logical path to the target.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    *   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 is a meta-director).\n    *   iii) Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone. Here, -COCH3 directs to position 5, but -Br (an o,p-director) directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The directors are in conflict, which will lead to a mixture of products, not a high-yield synthesis of the desired isomer. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n    *   This sequence just returns to the starting material, benzene. This is a pointless loop. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n    *   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of p-Bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both -Br and -NO2 groups. This reaction fails. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's see if we can find a plausible (though complex) path that matches these reagents. The overall strategy must be the amino-group-directed synthesis. A successful, high-yield synthesis is as follows:\n    1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline.** (Matches steps **i** and **ii**).\n    2.  **Aniline → p-Aminoacetophenone.** This is a complex transformation. A possible way is protecting the aniline as acetanilide, performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation (which gives the para product), and then deprotecting. Let's assume the single step **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3** is a shorthand for this entire process of getting the acetyl group onto the ring para to the amino group. The product is 4-aminoacetophenone.\n    3.  **4-aminoacetophenone → 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone.** This is step **iv) Br2/FeBr3**. The directing effects are checked: The strong o,p-directing -NH2 group and the m-directing -COCH3 group both direct bromination to position 3. This is a reinforcing effect and works well.\n    4.  **4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.** This is step **v) HNO3/H2SO4**. For this to work in high yield, the powerful -NH2 group must direct the nitration to position 5 (ortho to itself). This requires non-acidic conditions to avoid protonating the amine to the meta-directing -NH3+. Assuming such conditions are implied, this step is plausible.\n    5.  **4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazotize the -NH2 group.** This is step **vi) NaNO2/HCl**. This is the standard reaction.\n    6.  **Diazonium salt → Deamination (remove the N2+ group).** This is step **vii) H3PO2**. Removing the directing group at position 4 leaves the acetyl group at C1, the bromo group at C3, and the nitro group at C5. This yields the target product.\n\n    While the description of steps (iii) and (v) in option A is imprecise, the overall sequence of transformations represents a valid and high-yield synthetic strategy for this challenging target molecule. The other options contain fundamental flaws (failed reactions, incorrect regiochemistry, pointless loops). Therefore, Option A is the best choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
