    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant physical principles and formulas\n\nThe mean decay distance of a relativistic particle is given by the formula:\n$L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$\n\nWhere:\n*   $L$ is the mean decay distance in the lab frame.\n*   $\\tau$ is the proper mean lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n*   $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = E / (mc^2)$, where $E$ is the total energy and $mc^2$ is the rest mass energy.\n*   $\\beta = v/c$ is the particle's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$. The factors $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ are related by $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe proper mean lifetime $\\tau$ is related to the decay width $\\Gamma$ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these formulas, we get:\n$L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n\nIt is often more convenient to work with the term $\\gamma\\beta$ expressed through momentum $p$ and mass $m$:\n$pc = \\gamma \\beta (mc^2)$\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$\nSo, $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n\nThis gives the final formula for the decay length:\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n### 2. List the given values and constants\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Total energy, $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n*   Rest mass energy, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n*   Decay width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**Physical constants:**\n*   Reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar \\approx 6.582119569 \\times 10^{-22} \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{s}$\n*   Speed of light, $c = 299792458 \\, \\text{m/s}$\n*   The product $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ ($1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$) is very useful here.\n\n### 3. Perform the calculation\n\nLet's use a Python script for a precise calculation based on the derived formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and Given Values\nhbar_MeV_s = 6.582119569e-22  # Reduced Planck constant in MeV*s\nc_m_s = 299792458             # Speed of light in m/s\nE_X_MeV = 8000.0                # Production energy in MeV\nm_X_c2_MeV = 1200.0             # Mass (rest energy) in MeV\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0             # Decay width in MeV\n\n# --- Method 1: Step-by-step calculation ---\n\n# 1.

Based on the reasoning and calculation:\n$L \\approx 4.064 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\n### 4. Compare with the options\n\n*   Calculated value: $\\approx 4.064 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n*   A) $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n*   B) $5.0223 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n*   C) $4.0655 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n*   D) $5.0223 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference (about 0.03%) can be attributed to using slightly different values for the fundamental constants ($\\hbar, c$) in the source of the question. Option A is the only choice that matches both the order of magnitude and the significant figures of the result.\n\n<<<A>>>",
