    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0>. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means there must be an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Transition Selection Rules:** For an electric dipole transition between states |n,l,m> and |n',l',m'>, the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Determine Possible Intermediate States (First Transition):**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n    *   For the first E1 transition, l must change by ±1. Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   The principal quantum number n must decrease for a decay. A common intermediate state would be n'=2. So the intermediate state is of the form |2,1,m'>.\n    *   For the magnetic quantum number m, the change Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m' must be 0, ±1.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are:\n        *   |2,1,0> (for Δm=0)\n        *   |2,1,1> (for Δm=+1)\n        *   |2,1,-1> (for Δm=-1)\n\n4.  **Verify the Second Transition:**\n    *   From each possible intermediate state |2,1,m'>, we check if a transition to the final state |1,0,0> is allowed.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n    *   Consider the transition from |2,1,m'> to |1,0,0>:\n        *   Δn = 1-2 = -1 (allowed).\n        *   Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed).\n        *   Δm = 0-m'. For this to be allowed, m' must be 0 or ±1. All three of our possible intermediate states satisfy this.\n    *   So, all three routes are possible:\n        *   Route 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 2: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 3: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios) for Each Route:**\n    The probability of a particular cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state has only one significant decay channel (which is the case here, decaying to |1,0,0>).\n    The branching ratio B(i→f) is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition Γ(i→f) to the total decay rate from the initial state, Γ_tot(i).\n    B(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) / Γ_total\n\n    The total decay rate from |3,0,0> is the sum of the rates to the three possible intermediate states:\n    Γ_total = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>)\n\n    The spontaneous emission rate Γ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, |<f|**r**|i>|².\n    Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) ∝ |<2,1,m'| **r** |3,0,0>|²\n\n    We need to calculate the relative values of these matrix elements. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the probability of populating each of the m' sublevels of the l'=1 state must be equal.\n\n    Let's verify this with a calculation. The rate is proportional to:\n    *   For m'=0: |<2,1,0|z|3,0,0>|²\n    *   For m'=1: |<2,1,1|x|3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,1|y|3,0,0>|²\n    *   For m'=-1: |<2,1,-1|x|3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,-1|y|3,0,0>|²\n\n    The calculation using spherical harmonics (as detailed in the thought process) shows that these three quantities are equal. The radial part of the integral is common to all three, and the angular part gives:\n    *   Rate(→ m'=0) ∝ (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n    *   Rate(→ m'=1) ∝ (1/6 + 1/6) × |Radial Integral|² = (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n    *   Rate(→ m'=-1) ∝ (1/6 + 1/6) × |Radial Integral|² = (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n\n    Since the rates are equal, let's call the rate for each channel Γ_0.\n    Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>) = Γ_0\n    The total rate is Γ_total = Γ_0 + Γ_0 + Γ_0 = 3Γ_0.\n\n    The branching ratio for any specific route, say via |2,1,0>, is:\n    B = Γ_0 / (3Γ_0) = 1/3.\n\n    Thus, each of the three possible routes has a probability of 1/3.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3. This matches our result.\n    *   C) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3. Incorrect probability.\n    *   D) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. Incorrect probability.\n\n    The only correct option is B.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
