    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure and the relationships between the substituents:\n- The parent ring is benzene.\n- The substituents are: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n- Their positions are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n- **-OEt and -tBu are ortho (1,2) to each other.**\n- **-tBu and -NO2 are ortho (2,3) to each other.**\n- **-OEt and -NO2 are meta (1,3) to each other.**\n\nThe final step in all the options is `ix) NaOH/EtBr`. This is a Williamson ether synthesis, which converts a phenol (-OH) into an ether (-OEt). This means the immediate precursor to our target molecule must be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\nTherefore, the main goal of the reaction sequence (steps i to viii) is the high-yield synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies and Directing Effects\n\nWe need to install three groups (-OH, -tBu, -NO2) in a specific 1,2,3 arrangement. This is often difficult to achieve through simple sequential electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the substituents can conflict or lead to isomeric mixtures.\n\n*   **-OH (phenol)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para- director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para- director (sterically bulky).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta- director.\n\nA high-yield synthesis for a complex substitution pattern often involves using **blocking groups** (like -SO3H) or functional group interconversions via **diazonium salts**. The presence of reagents for sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`), desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`, heat), and diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) in the options strongly suggests these strategies are being used.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Options\n\nLet's analyze Option A, as it presents the most logical and standard strategy for controlling regiochemistry, despite appearing complex.\n\n**Option A:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**\n    `Benzene --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)--> tert-butylbenzene`\n    This attaches the bulky tert-butyl group.\n\n*   **Step ii: Sulfonation (Blocking Step)**\n    `tert-butylbenzene --(SO3/H2SO4)--> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The bulky -tBu group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to sterics, substitution at the para position is highly favored. This blocks the para position with a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be removed later.\n\n*   **Step iii: Nitration**\n    `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`\n    We are nitrating a ring with two substituents: -tBu (at C4) and -SO3H (at C1).\n    -   The -tBu group (activating) directs ortho to itself, i.e., to positions C3 and C5.\n    -   The -SO3H group (deactivating) directs meta to itself, i.e., to positions C3 and C5.\n    Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions. This results in a clean, high-yield reaction giving **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Critically, in this molecule, the **-tBu and -NO2 groups are ortho to each other**, which matches the arrangement in the final product.\n\n*   **Step iv: Reduction**\n    `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid --(Fe/HCl)--> 4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n\nAt this point, we have an intermediate (`4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`) where the key ortho relationship between the future -tBu group and -NO2 group positions is established. However, to reach the final product, a complex series of transformations is needed, and the order of steps vi-viii in option A seems unusual or contains typos. For instance, `HNO3/H2SO4` (step vi) on a diazonium salt is not a standard textbook reaction for its conversion. There's likely a flaw in the question's provided steps.\n\nHowever, let's compare this to other options:\n*   **Option B:** Starts with direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene, which gives mostly the para-isomer and a small amount of the needed ortho-isomer, failing the \"high-yield\" criterion from the start.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. FC alkylation on aniline is problematic and gives the meta product, which has the wrong isomeric relationship.\n*   **Option D:** The order of reactions is illogical (e.g., reduction with Fe/HCl before nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 to make a nitro-product).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A outlines the most strategically sound approach. It uses a blocking group to force the desired regiochemistry (ortho relationship between t-butyl and nitro groups) in high yield. While the subsequent steps (vi-viii) for converting the intermediate `4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid` to the target precursor `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` are listed in a confusing or incorrect order, the initial core strategy (steps i-iv) is the most viable path presented among all choices for a high-yield synthesis. In the context of a multiple-choice question where one option must be the best, Option A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming typos in the later steps. No other option provides a feasible route to the required substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
