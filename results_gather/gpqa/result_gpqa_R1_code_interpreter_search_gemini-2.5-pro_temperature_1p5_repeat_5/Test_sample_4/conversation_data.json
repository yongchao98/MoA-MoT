    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$:\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    These are the spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle (like a muon), where $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis. In spherical coordinates, this corresponds to setting the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\n    The components of the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ are:\n    *   $n_x = \\sin\\theta$\n    *   $n_y = 0$\n    *   $n_z = \\cos\\theta$\n    So, $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y(0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n    Substituting the matrix forms:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right]$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\\\ 1 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta & 0 \\cdot \\sin\\theta + (-1) \\cdot \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components:**\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Using the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    *   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    *   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substitute these into the expression for $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, we have the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. This determines the eigenvector up to a constant scaling factor.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle_{un} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    To simplify and normalize the eigenvector, we can choose a convenient value for $a$. A good choice is $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    If $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$, then $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    So the eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    Now, let's check if this vector is normalized. The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components:\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^* \\cos(\\theta/2) + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^* \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    Since the components are real:\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    The eigenvector is already normalized.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option D."
