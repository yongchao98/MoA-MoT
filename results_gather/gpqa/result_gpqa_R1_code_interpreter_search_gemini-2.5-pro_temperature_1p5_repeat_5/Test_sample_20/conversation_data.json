    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a phenomenon where a single chemical compound tends to exist in two or more interconvertible structures that are different in terms of the relative position of one atomic nucleus, which is generally hydrogen. The most common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, where the carbon is sp³ hybridized).\n\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n        *   Let's examine the carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups. These carbons are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized.\n        *   While these alpha-carbons do have hydrogen atoms attached, these are vinylic hydrogens. The typical mechanism for keto-enol tautomerism involves the removal of a proton from an sp³ hybridized alpha-carbon. The enolization of benzoquinone is not a favorable or spontaneous process under normal conditions; it would require a reduction reaction to form hydroquinone, which is not a tautomerization.\n        *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³ hybridized (CH₂ groups). Each of these carbons is alpha to two carbonyl groups.\n        *   The hydrogen atoms on these carbons are highly acidic and are readily available to participate in keto-enol tautomerism.\n        *   The enol form of this compound is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from forming an aromatic ring is a very strong driving force, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists almost exclusively in its enol (aromatic) form.\n        *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C-2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group.\n        *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n            1.  -H (hydrogen)\n            2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n            3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n        *   The molecule is chiral and thus **will show optical isomerism** (it has two enantiomers, R and S).\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the trans isomer of but-2-enedioic acid's dimethyl ester. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the -COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and is planar. Any planar molecule or molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral. An achiral molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n        *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Decision**\n    *   A = The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   B = The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
