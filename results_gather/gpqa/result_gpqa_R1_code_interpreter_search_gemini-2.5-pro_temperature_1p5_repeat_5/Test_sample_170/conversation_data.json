    "This problem requires us to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction. The regioselectivity (ortho, meta, or para) of this reaction is governed by the nature of the substituent already present on the benzene ring.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the substituents\nWe first need to classify each substituent as either activating or deactivating, and as an ortho/para-director or a meta-director.\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **1) -CH3 (methyl):** Activating.\n    *   **5) -C2H5 (ethyl):** Activating.\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-directing groups:** Halogens are a special case. They withdraw electron density via induction (deactivating) but donate via resonance, making them ortho/para directors.\n    *   **3) -Cl (chloro):** Deactivating, but ortho/para-directing.\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester):** Deactivating.\n    *   **4) -NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH (carboxylic acid):** Deactivating.\n\n### Step 2: Separate the substances into two main groups\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two groups:\n*   **Group A (Low para yield):** The meta-directors will produce very little para-isomer. This group includes substances 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **Group B (High para yield):** The ortho/para-directors will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. This group includes substances 1, 3, and 5.\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will have substances from Group A first, followed by substances from Group B.\n\n### Step 3: Order the substances within Group A (meta-directors)\nWe need to arrange substances 2, 4, and 6 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. For meta-directors, a stronger deactivating effect leads to more selective meta-substitution, and thus an even lower yield of the minor ortho and para products.\nThe order of deactivating strength is generally:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\nThis means the -NO₂ group is the strongest meta-director, leading to the lowest para yield. The -COOC₂H₅ group is the weakest deactivator in this set, leading to the highest para yield among the three.\nSo, the order of *increasing* para yield is:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\n### Step 4: Order the substances within Group B (ortho/para-directors)\nWe need to arrange substances 1, 3, and 5 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by sterics and electronics.\n\n*   **Comparing 1 (-CH₃) and 5 (-C₂H₅):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is larger (sterically bulkier) than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders the attack of the electrophile at the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, thus increasing the relative yield of the para-isomer. So, the para yield for ethylbenzene will be higher than for toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** Halogens, like chlorine, are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, their strong inductive effect deactivates the ortho positions more than the para position. This, combined with sterics, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data confirms that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a significantly higher percentage of the para-isomer (~87%) compared to toluene (~62%) and ethylbenzene (~68%).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### Step 5: Combine the ordered groups\nNow we combine the order from Step 3 and Step 4. The substances in Group A have a much lower para yield than those in Group B.\n\nCombining (4 < 6 < 2) and (1 < 5 < 3), we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
