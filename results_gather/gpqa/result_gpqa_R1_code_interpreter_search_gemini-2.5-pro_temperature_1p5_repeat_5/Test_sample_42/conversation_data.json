    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Molecule and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these.\n*   Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as **C1**.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents**\n\nLet's map out the positions of the other groups relative to C1:\n\n*   **Para (C4) Substituent:** The methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position **C4**.\n*   **Meta (C3 & C5) Substituents:** The carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and the cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid (C1) and also meta to each other. This places them at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n*   **Ortho (C2 & C6) Substituents:** The hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they are at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n\n**3. Use Additional Information to Fix the Structure**\n\nWe have one more piece of information: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be at either C3 or C5.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must be at either C2 or C6.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho). This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho, so it must be at **C6**.\n    *   If the hydroxyl is at C6, the dimethylamino group must be at **C2**.\n    *   If the cyano is at C5, the carbaldehyde group must be at **C3**.\n    *   This gives the structure: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n*   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho). This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho, so it must be at **C2**.\n    *   If the hydroxyl is at C2, the dimethylamino group must be at **C6**.\n    *   If the cyano is at C3, the carbaldehyde group must be at **C5**.\n    *   This gives the structure: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n\nNotice that these two cases describe the exact same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring. We have now unambiguously determined the constitution of the molecule. The final step is to apply the correct numbering rule.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\n*   **Rule 1: Lowest Locants.** We start at C1 (-COOH). We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   Clockwise numbering gives the substituent locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering also gives the locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since both directions give the same set of locants, we must use a tie-breaker rule.\n*   **Rule 2 (Tie-breaker): Alphabetical Priority.** When the locant set is identical, we give the lowest possible number to the substituent group that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents**\n\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   Cyano\n*   Dimethylamino\n*   Formyl (for the -CHO group)\n*   Hydroxy\n*   Methoxy\n\nIn alphabetical order, they are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nThe first group alphabetically is **cyano**. Therefore, we must choose the numbering direction that assigns the lowest number to the cyano group.\n\n*   **Numbering Direction 1 (from Case 1):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH. The cyano group is at **C5**.\n*   **Numbering Direction 2 (from Case 2):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2. The cyano group is at **C3**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering is the one from Direction 2.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\n\nUsing the correct numbering (C3-cyano), we list the substituents alphabetically with their locants:\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino) - parenthesis is used for complex substituents like dimethylamino.\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\", we get the full IUPAC name:\n\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
