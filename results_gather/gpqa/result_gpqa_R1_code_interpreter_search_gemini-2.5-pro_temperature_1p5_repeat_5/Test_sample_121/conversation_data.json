    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step-by-step reaction analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction selectively brominates the carbon atom adjacent to the carboxyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   **Product 1:** Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the hydrogens on this carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a Fischer esterification. A carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** The carboxyl group (-COOH) of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is a good leaving group. The carbon bearing the bromine is a primary carbon, ideal for SN2.\n    *   **Product 3:** The cyanide group replaces the bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is an intramolecular dialkylation of an active methylene compound.\n        *   The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate): `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻`.\n        *   This nucleophilic carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion. This is the first alkylation. Intermediate: `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`.\n        *   The intermediate still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again, forming a new carbanion: `[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻`.\n        *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring where C1 is substituted with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n### **1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Structure and Symmetry:**\n\nThe molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted at C1 with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group. At room temperature, due to fast chair-chair interconversion and free rotation of the substituents, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group (on average).\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences:\n*   The right side and left side of the ring are equivalent.\n*   Carbon C2 is chemically equivalent to C6.\n*   Carbon C3 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\nWe will count the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal** (a triplet).\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are isochronous (have the same chemical shift). They will produce **1 signal** (a quartet).\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    In a substituted cyclohexane ring, the two protons on a given CH2 group (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They will give separate signals.\n\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent.\n        *   The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are in identical environments. This set gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are in identical environments. This set gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C2/C6 positions)\n\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent.\n        *   The two axial protons (one on C3, one on C5) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two equatorial protons (one on C3, one on C5) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C3/C5 positions)\n\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry.\n        *   The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are diastereotopic. Their chemical environments are different.\n        *   The single axial proton gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The single equatorial proton gives **1 signal**.\n        *   (Total of 2 signals from the C4 position)\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n\nTotal distinct signals = 2 + 6 = **8**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
