    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its total energy is its rest-mass energy, E_initial = Mc². We are given that Mc² = 300 GeV. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is p_initial = 0.\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, with rest-masses m₁ and m₂. They move apart with some kinetic energies, T₁ and T₂, and momenta, p₁ and p₂.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragment masses:\n*   One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. We'll assume this means the ratio of their masses is 2:1. Let m₁ be the more massive fragment, so: `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n*   The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations:\n1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2 * m₂` into the second equation:\n    `(2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n    `m₂ = 0.33 * M`\n2.  Now find m₁:\n    `m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before must equal the total energy after.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n    `300 GeV = (198 GeV + 99 GeV) + T₁ + T₂`\n    `300 GeV = 297 GeV + T₁ + T₂`\n    The total kinetic energy released (known as the Q-value of the reaction) is:\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before is zero, so the total momentum after must also be zero.\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p₁ + p₂`\n    This means the fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `|p₁| = |p₂|`. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T_cl = p² / (2m)`. Since the momenta `p` are the same for both fragments:\n*   `T₁_cl = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂_cl = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of their kinetic energies:\n`T₁_cl / T₂_cl = (p² / (2m₁)) / (p² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁ = (0.33M) / (0.66M) = 1/2`\nSo, `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl + (2 * T₁_cl) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct Relativistic Formula**\n\nIn special relativity, the energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`). We can rearrange this to find the momentum:\n`(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`\n\nSince the momentum magnitude `p` is the same for both fragments, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n`T₁² + 2*T₁*m₁c² = T₂² + 2*T₂*m₂c²`\n\nNow substitute `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`:\n`T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)`\n`T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T₁ = 9 - 6*T₁ + 594 - 198*T₁`\n`396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁`\n`396*T₁ + 204*T₁ = 603`\n`600*T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   Correct (Relativistic) `T₁ = 1005 MeV`\n*   Classical `T₁_cl = 1000 MeV`\n*   Difference = `T₁ - T₁_cl = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can run a short script.\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values in GeV\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest mass energies of the fragments based on the problem statement\n# m1 = 2 * m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2  # (0.99 / 3) * Mc2\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2  # 2 * m2c2\n\n# Total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = 1/2 => T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = Q => T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# From conservation of momentum, p1^2 = p2^2\n# (p_c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*mc^2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2\n# Using T2 = Q - T1, we solve for T1. The algebraic solution is:\n# T1 = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2) / (2 * (m1c2 + m2c2) + 2*Q)\nT1_relativistic = Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2) / (2 * (m1c2 + m2c2) + 2 * Q)\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n> Classical T1: 1.0000 GeV\n> Relativistic T1: 1.0050 GeV\n> Difference: 5.00 MeV\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) calculated relativistically and classically.\n\n**1. Initial Information & Given Values**\n\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `E₀ = Mc² = 300 GeV`\n*   Initial nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate the more massive fragment as fragment 1: `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the masses:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow find m₁:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before fission equals the total energy after fission. The energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n    `T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    So, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after the fission must be zero. This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n    `p_initial = p_final = 0`\n    `p₁ + p₂ = 0  =>  p₁ = -p₂`\n    The magnitudes are equal: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculating T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n*   `T₁_cl = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂_cl = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass: `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\nThis gives us `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculating T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of the rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + mc²`.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2Tmc² + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\nThis simplifies to a useful expression for momentum: `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\nSince the momentum magnitudes are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n*   `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n*   `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n*   `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`\n\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` term cancels from both sides:\n`396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6. Finding the Difference**\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `T₁_relativistic = 1005 MeV`\n*   `T₁_classical = 1000 MeV`\n\n`Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
