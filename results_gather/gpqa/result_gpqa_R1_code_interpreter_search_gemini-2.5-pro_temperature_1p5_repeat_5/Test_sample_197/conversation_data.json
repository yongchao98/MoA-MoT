    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN^-`) to form a series of complexes. The total cobalt `c(Co)` is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]`\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):**\n    The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the free thiocyanate ion concentration `[SCN^-]`, and the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   `[Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n3.  **Define the mole fraction (α):**\n    We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `Co(SCN)2`. The mole fraction of this species, denoted as α₂, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n4.  **Derive the formula for the mole fraction:**\n    Substitute the expressions from steps 1 and 2 into the mole fraction equation:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]²) / ([Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-])`\n    Replace each complex concentration with its expression in terms of `[Co^2+]`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]²) / ([Co^2+] + β₁[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β₂[Co^2+][SCN^-]² + β₃[Co^2+][SCN^-]³ + β₄[Co^2+][SCN^-]⁴)`\n    The `[Co^2+]` term is common to all terms in the numerator and denominator, so it can be canceled out. This is a crucial step and shows that the fraction of each species depends only on the free ligand concentration, not the total metal concentration.\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN^-]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN^-] + β₂[SCN^-]² + β₃[SCN^-]³ + β₄[SCN^-]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Approximate the free ligand concentration:**\n    The problem states the total cobalt concentration is `c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M` and the thiocyanate concentration is `0.1 M`. Since the thiocyanate concentration is ten times larger than the cobalt concentration, we can make the common and reasonable approximation that the concentration of free thiocyanate `[SCN^-]` at equilibrium is equal to its initial total concentration.\n    `[SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n6.  **Calculate the value:**\n    Now, we plug the given values into the formula for α₂:\n    *   `[SCN^-] = 0.1`\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40` (This is for the target species `Co(SCN)2`)\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate the denominator first (let's call it D):\n    `D = 1 + β₁[SCN^-]¹ + β₂[SCN^-]² + β₃[SCN^-]³ + β₄[SCN^-]⁴`\n    `D = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)² + 63*(0.1)³ + 16*(0.1)⁴`\n    `D = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.01) + 63*(0.001) + 16*(0.0001)`\n    `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    `D = 2.3646`\n\n    Now, calculate the numerator (N), which corresponds to the `Co(SCN)2` term in the denominator:\n    `N = β₂ * [SCN^-]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Calculate the fraction α₂:\n    `α₂ = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage of `Co(SCN)2` = `α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nTo verify the calculation, a Python script can be used.\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Numerator for the fraction of Co(SCN)2\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# Denominator (sum of all terms in the distribution equation)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\npercentage=16.916180326482276\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we first need to determine its mole fraction (`α₂`) relative to all other cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co^2+` ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]`\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed using the overall stability constants (`βn`) and the concentrations of the free ions (`[Co^2+]` and `[SCN-]`):\n*   `[Co(SCN)+] = β₁ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3-] = β₃ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4^2-] = β₄ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]⁴`\n\nThe mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex (`α₂`) is given by:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each species, we can derive a formula for `α₂` that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN-]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴)`\n\nThe problem states that the total cobalt concentration is `0.01 M` and the thiocyanate concentration is `0.1 M`. Since the thiocyanate is in a 10-fold excess, the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt will be small compared to its total concentration. Therefore, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]` as its initial total concentration, `0.1 M`.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β₁[SCN-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN-]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN-]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN-]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms:\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex:\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN-]² = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply the mole fraction by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe python code executed in the previous step confirms this calculation, giving a result of 16.916%. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
