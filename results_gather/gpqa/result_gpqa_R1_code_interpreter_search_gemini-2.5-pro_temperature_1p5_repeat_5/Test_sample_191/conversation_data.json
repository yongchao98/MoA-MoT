    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We begin with a spherical conductor that is electrically neutral (has no net charge). It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive charge, `+q`, is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To understand the total amount of induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. The electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. According to Gauss's Law, the net electric flux through this surface is zero, which implies that the total electric charge enclosed by the surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed inside and the charge induced on the inner cavity wall ($q_{inner}$).\n    $q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$\n    Therefore, the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$. The distribution of this `-q` charge will be non-uniform, arranged to precisely cancel the field from `+q` within the conductor material.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor ($q_{outer}$).\n    Total charge on conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = -q + q_{outer} = 0$ (since the conductor itself was uncharged)\n    This gives $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. This means:\n    *   The charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) produce zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   The charge on the outer surface (`+q`) distributes itself completely independently of the arrangement of charges inside the cavity.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface will spread out to minimize repulsion. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the charge will distribute itself uniformly over this surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The point P is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the sum of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall. As stated by the principle of electrostatic shielding, the net field from these two at any point outside the cavity is zero.\n    *   The field from the induced charge `+q` which is distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface of radius R.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the uniform spherical shell of charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n8.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** The shell theorem (a result derived from Gauss's Law) states that the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer shell = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the shell = Center of the conductor, O.\n    *   Distance of point P from the center O = `L`.\n\n    Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion on other variables:** The information about the cavity's position (`s`), the distance of P from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `\\theta` are all distractors. Due to electrostatic shielding, the details of the cavity's geometry and the charge's position within it do not influence the electric field outside the conductor. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the outer sphere.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, uses distance from cavity center)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distance)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distance)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
