    "This problem requires identifying the correct chemical formula for a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectral data. Let's break down the information provided step-by-step to deduce the structure and its formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectral data:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents, which means the core has the formula -C6H4-. A benzene ring contributes 4 units to the degree of unsaturation (DoU) (one for the ring itself and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group. An ester functional group contains a carbonyl (C=O) and a C-O single bond. The carbonyl group contributes 1 unit to the DoU. So far, the required DoU is 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) = 5.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum - Six Signals:**\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** In a di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4), there are 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals implies symmetry. This pattern is characteristic of a para (1,4)-substituted benzene ring, where the two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are equivalent, giving rise to two signals (often two doublets).\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** These are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This C=C bond adds another unit to the DoU, bringing the total to 6.\n            *   Signal 1: A doublet. This indicates the proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n            *   Signal 2: A doublet of quartets. This indicates the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group, giving the quartet).\n            *   This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring). Let's call the ring `Ar`. In the structure `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`, H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet. H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and this doublet is further split by the -CH3 group into quartets, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment accounts for one C=C double bond, two vinyl protons, and one -CH3 group. The formula of this fragment is **-C3H5**.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group described above. The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester functionality.\n        *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that restricts the possible structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure and determine the formula:**\n    *   We have the para-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**.\n    *   We have the propenyl substituent: **-C3H5**.\n    *   We have an ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3). The absence of -CH2- signals means the methyl group must be directly attached to the carbonyl (acetate ester, Ar-O-CO-CH3) or the ester oxygen (methyl ester, Ar-COOCH3). Both possibilities lead to the same fragment count. Let's assume a methyl ester substituent: **-COOCH3**. This fragment has the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result against the given options:**\n    *   The derived formula C11H12O2 matches option A.\n    *   Let's check the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2. DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6. This matches our structural analysis: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (C=C in propenyl) + 1 (C=O in ester) = 6.\n    *   Now, let's briefly consider the other options:\n        *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 5. This would mean no C=C double bond in the side chain, which contradicts the vinyl-H signals.\n        *   C) C12H12O2: DoU = 7. This requires an additional double bond or ring, for which there is no evidence.\n        *   D) C12H14O2: DoU = 6. This formula has the same DoU as option A, but differs by a CH2 unit. Since the NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, this option is ruled out.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
