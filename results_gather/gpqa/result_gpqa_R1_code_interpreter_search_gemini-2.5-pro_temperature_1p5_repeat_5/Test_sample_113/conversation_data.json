    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. The reactants are a ketone (butan-2-one) and a source of cyanide ions (NaCN). The product is a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two steps.\n        1.  **Nucleophilic attack:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the π bond of the carbonyl group and forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n            CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃\n        2.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged alkoxide ion is then protonated by a proton source to form the final stable hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin.\n            CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂CH₃ (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must provide the proton (H⁺) for the second step. H₃O⁺, which represents a source of acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water), is the standard reagent used to provide this proton. The reaction is typically performed by mixing the carbonyl compound with NaCN and then acidifying the mixture. So, A = H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is called hydrolysis.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires either a strong acid or a strong base as a catalyst, along with water and often heat.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-C≡N + 2H₂O + H⁺ (catalyst) → R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-C≡N + H₂O + OH⁻ (catalyst) → R-COO⁻ + NH₃ (followed by acidification to get R-COOH)\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. Looking at the options for B (CH₃COOH and HCl), HCl is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. CH₃COOH is a weak acid and would not be effective enough for this transformation under typical conditions. Therefore, B = HCl.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.\n    *   Matching these findings with the given options, we find that option D fits perfectly.\n\n*   **Option Evaluation:**\n    *   A) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH - Incorrect.\n    *   B) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH - Incorrect, B is a weak acid.\n    *   C) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl - Incorrect, A is not the proton source.\n    *   D) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl - Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
