    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product's structure from the provided NMR data.**\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C11H12O. The reaction appears to be an isomerization, as the product's formula, deduced from the NMR data, is also C11H12O.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBU):** For C11H12O, DBU = (2 * 11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 6.\n*   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A signal at δ 197.7 ppm indicates a ketone carbonyl group (C=O). This accounts for 1 DBU.\n    *   Multiple signals in the δ 126-145 ppm range indicate sp2 hybridized carbons, characteristic of a benzene ring and a C=C double bond. A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBU and a C=C double bond accounts for 1 DBU.\n    *   Total DBU = 1 (C=O) + 4 (ring) + 1 (C=C) = 6. This is consistent.\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlet signals for two methyl groups. This means neither methyl group is attached to a carbon with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic/olefinic region (δ 6.75 - 7.71) correspond to 6 protons.\n        *   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): These two doublets, each integrating to 1H, must be two protons on a C=C double bond, coupled to each other (-CH=CH-).\n*   **Putting the pieces together for the product:**\n    1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One of the methyl singlets must be a substituent on this ring. This gives us a 4-methylphenyl (p-tolyl) group. The other methyl singlet must be part of the second substituent. An acetyl group (-C(=O)CH3) would give a methyl singlet, and we have a ketone function.\n    2.  The fragments are: a p-tolyl group (CH3-C6H4-), an acetyl group (-COCH3), and a vinylene group (-CH=CH-).\n    3.  Assembling these fragments logically leads to the structure: **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n        *   Structure: CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3\n        *   Formula: C11H12O. This matches.\n    4.  Let's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n        *   `p-Tolyl group`: CH3 singlet (e.g., δ 2.31) and two 2H doublets for the aromatic protons (δ 7.08 and 7.71). The protons ortho to the electron-donating methyl group are shielded (δ 7.08), and the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing enone system are deshielded (δ 7.71). This fits perfectly.\n        *   `Enone part`: -CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3. The acetyl methyl gives a singlet (e.g., δ 2.28). The two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) are doublets (δ 6.75 and 7.68). This is also a perfect fit.\n    5.  The 13C data is also consistent with this structure. We expect 9 unique carbon signals (the two pairs of aromatic CH carbons are equivalent): C=O, 2xCH3, 2xCH(olefinic), 2xCH(aromatic, pair 1), 2xCH(aromatic, pair 2), 2xQuaternary(aromatic). The data shows exactly 9 signals, with two signals corresponding to 2C each (δ 126.9 and 129.1), matching the p-substituted ring.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** The product of the reaction is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound X by considering the reaction.**\n\nThe reaction converts Compound X (C11H12O) into 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This is an isomerization. The reaction is carried out with DABCO (a base) at high temperature. We need to find which of the given options could be Compound X.\n\nA key principle in identifying the starting material of a rearrangement is that the carbon skeleton is often conserved. The product contains a **p-tolyl group (4-methylphenyl)**. It is extremely unlikely that the reaction conditions (DABCO, 130°C) would cause a methyl group to migrate onto a phenyl ring. Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a p-tolyl group.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound contains a *phenyl* group and a separate methyl group. It does not have a p-tolyl group.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-. This contains a **p-tolyl group**. The formula is C11H12O. This is a plausible candidate. The reaction would be the isomerization of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone, which is a known chemical transformation.\n    *   `X = 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane`: CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2\n    *   `Product`: CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)CH3\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** Styryl group is C6H5-CH=CH-. This contains a *phenyl* group, not a tolyl group. Also, its formula is C10H10O, which does not match.\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound contains a *phenyl* group from the styryl substituent. It does not have a p-tolyl group.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2:** Based on the conservation of the carbon skeleton, only option B has the necessary p-tolyl group to form the identified product.\n\nFinal verification confirms that the isomerization of 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (a vinyl epoxide) to 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one (an α,β-unsaturated ketone) is a chemically reasonable reaction under thermal/basic conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
