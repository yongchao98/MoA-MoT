    "*   **Step 1: Identify the starting material and its structure.**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n    *   `cyclohex`: A six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   `-3-ene`: A double bond in the ring, starting at carbon 3 (between C3 and C4).\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   `2-formyl`: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position C2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A -CH=CH2 group at position C5.\n\n    The structure contains the following functional groups and features contributing to unsaturation:\n    1.  A six-membered ring.\n    2.  A carbon-carbon double bond within the ring (`-3-ene`).\n    3.  A carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group.\n    4.  A carbon-oxygen double bond in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    5.  A carbon-oxygen double bond in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.**\n    We can count the atoms from the structure drawn based on the name:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** Let's count them carefully.\n        *   C1 (with -COOH): 1 H\n        *   C2 (with -CHO): 1 H\n        *   C3 (double bond): 1 H\n        *   C4 (double bond): 1 H\n        *   C5 (with vinyl): 1 H\n        *   C6 (saturated): 2 H\n        *   In -COOH: 1 H\n        *   In -CHO: 1 H\n        *   In -CH=CH2: 3 H\n        *   Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the reagent and its function.**\n    The reagent is red phosphorus and excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P/HI). This is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its function is to completely reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Aldehyde (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Carbon-carbon double bonds (-C=C-) are reduced to single bonds (-C-C-).\n    *   It essentially removes all heteroatoms (like oxygen) and all pi bonds, leaving behind a saturated hydrocarbon skeleton.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n    The reaction will perform the following transformations on the starting material:\n    1.  The cyclohexane ring structure is preserved.\n    2.  The -COOH group at C1 is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    3.  The -CHO group at C2 is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    4.  The double bond in the ring (at C3=C4) is reduced to a single bond.\n    5.  The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton is maintained, so the product will have 10 carbon atoms. Since all functional groups and double bonds are reduced, the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). The specific product would be 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n    A saturated monocyclic alkane has the general formula **CnH2n**.\n    Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (C=10), its molecular formula will be **C10H(2*10) = C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated using the molecular formula. The formula is:\n    IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    Where C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, N = number of nitrogens.\n\n    For the product C10H20:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   X = 0\n    *   N = 0\n\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10\n    IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, the IHD can be determined by inspecting the structure of the product. The IHD counts the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   Product: 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\n    *   Total IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n    Both methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
