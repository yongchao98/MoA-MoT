    "This question requires an evaluation of four statements related to the production of branched polyethylene from a single monomer (ethylene) using a dual catalyst system. This process, known as tandem catalysis, involves one catalyst polymerizing ethylene while a second catalyst oligomerizes ethylene into short alpha-olefins (like 1-butene or 1-hexene), which are then incorporated as branches into the main polymer chain.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n**A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nThis statement refers to single-reactor tandem catalysis. While major chemical companies like Dow Chemical have developed and patented such technologies (e.g., as part of their INSITE™ technology), these systems are very complex. The two catalysts must be compatible and operate under identical process conditions. It is more common industrially to produce the comonomer (e.g., 1-hexene) in a dedicated plant and then feed it into the polymerization reactor. While the technology exists and might be used in some specialized cases, it is debatable whether it qualifies as a widely \"implemented\" technology on an industrial scale compared to traditional methods. There is ambiguity in this statement regarding the scale and breadth of implementation, making it potentially incorrect in the context of a \"single correct answer\" question.\n\n**B) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nGroup VIa (or Group 6) of the periodic table includes Chromium (Cr). Chromium-based catalysts are well-known and industrially significant for the selective trimerization of ethylene into 1-hexene. This reaction is the \"essential additional reaction step\" that generates the comonomer for the branches. For example, Chevron Phillips Chemical has commercialized a process using a chromium catalyst with specific PNP (phosphine-amine-phosphine) type ligands for this purpose. These catalysts are activated by co-catalysts (\"specific activators\"). Since a well-established, industrially relevant example exists, this statement is factually correct.\n\n**C) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nNoble metals include platinum, palladium, rhodium, etc. While some late transition metal catalysts (like those based on nickel or palladium) are known to oligomerize or polymerize ethylene, achieving high selectivity to a single alpha-olefin (like 1-hexene or 1-octene) to create \"regular branches\" is a significant challenge. The most successful and selective catalysts for this specific task are based on early- to mid-transition metals like chromium (Group VIa) and titanium (Group IVa). It is plausible that no noble metal catalyst is efficient enough for this particular selective transformation, which would make the first part of the statement (\"can be used\") incorrect. Even if they could be used, their high cost would indeed make them economically unfeasible for producing a commodity polymer like polyethylene. However, if they cannot perform the required selective reaction effectively, the entire statement is flawed.\n\n**D) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThe \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene. Most organometallic catalysts for olefin polymerization and oligomerization, including the Group VIa chromium systems discussed in statement B, require an activator or co-catalyst. The most common activators by far are aluminum-based compounds, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), and various alkylaluminum reagents (e.g., triethylaluminum). These activators are crucial for generating the active catalytic species. The claim that they \"do not work\" is factually incorrect, as they are essential for the function of the most prominent industrial catalysts for this very reaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Statement D is definitively false.\n*   Statement B is definitively true, supported by major industrial processes.\n*   Statements A and C are plausibly false due to nuances in industrial practice and catalyst capability, respectively.\n\nGiven that only one statement can be correct, the most accurate and verifiable statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
