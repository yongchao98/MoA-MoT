    "**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   The formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   We can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about the structure.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity bands):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This strongly suggests the compound contains a -NH2 group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong band):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (which is usually below 1690 cm⁻¹) but is characteristic of an ester. The position around 1720 cm⁻¹ specifically suggests an ester group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a triplet. A triplet (3 peaks) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) in an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons that are a quartet. A quartet (4 peaks) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a CH3 group). The high chemical shift (downfield) at 4.5 ppm indicates this CH2 group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is an oxygen atom. This signal, combined with the one at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen: -O-CH2-CH3. This is the \"ethyl\" part of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. Broad signals in this region are often due to exchangeable protons, such as those in an -OH or -NH2 group. Combined with the IR evidence for a primary amine, this signal is confidently assigned to the -NH2 protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. Having two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two groups of two equivalent protons.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield (more shielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like -NH2).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (more deshielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester, -COOR).\n\n**4. Conclusion and Structure Determination**\n\n*   From the IR and NMR, we have identified the following fragments:\n    *   A primary amine (-NH2)\n    *   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n    *   A *para*-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   Assembling these pieces gives only one possible structure: The ethyl ester group and the amino group are attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   Let's check this against the options:\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be -CO-CH2CH3. The CH2 here would be adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear at ~2.3 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Also, the C=O stretch in the IR would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It also only has a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch. It is also *meta*-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
