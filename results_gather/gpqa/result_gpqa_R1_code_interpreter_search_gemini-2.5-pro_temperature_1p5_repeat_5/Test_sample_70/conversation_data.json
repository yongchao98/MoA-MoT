    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its distance from the star (the semi-major axis, a). Specifically, the energy a planet receives from its star is proportional to 1/a². The planet radiates energy as a blackbody, proportional to T_eq⁴. For equilibrium, the energy in must equal the energy out, which leads to the relationship T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a², or T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), i.e., P² ∝ a³. This can be rewritten as a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\nWe can combine these two relationships to find the connection between equilibrium temperature and orbital period:\nT_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\nT_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)\nT_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) can be expressed in terms of the ratio of their orbital periods (P_4 and P_2):\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the ratio of the periods of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\nP_4 / P_2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (1.75)^(-1/3)\n\nThe calculation yields:\n(1.75)^(-1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.83\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.75\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
