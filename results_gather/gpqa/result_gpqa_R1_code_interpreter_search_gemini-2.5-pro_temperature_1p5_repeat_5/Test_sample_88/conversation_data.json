    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of KOH.\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane has a rigid adamantane cage structure. The bromine atoms are at bridgehead (tertiary) positions.\n*   **Reagents & Conditions:** KOH is a strong base. High temperature (240°C) suggests that harsh conditions may lead to rearrangements, not just simple substitution or elimination.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a characteristic absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group, likely a ketone. The frequency is consistent with a ketone in a strained ring system, like those found in cage compounds.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). This adds up to 14 protons. The formula of the starting material, C₁₀H₁₄Br₂, also has 14 protons. This implies the product has a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O (loss of 2 Br, gain of 1 O). The degree of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4. This is consistent with a tricyclic (adamantane-like) structure (3 rings = 3 DoU) plus one carbonyl group (1 C=O = 1 DoU).\n*   **Challenge:** The presence of a signal at 4.79 ppm is highly unusual for a saturated ketone. Additionally, the subsequent ozonolysis step (Reaction 3) requires a C=C double bond, which contradicts the formula C₁₀H₁₄O deduced from the proton count. This suggests a complex reaction sequence where the identity of the intermediates is not straightforward. The most likely scenario is that a rearrangement occurs to a less common structure, and the provided NMR data for Product 1 may be erroneous or for a very unusual structure that still facilitates the overall transformation. We will proceed by deducing a chemically plausible pathway that connects the start and end of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   **Plausible Pathway:** This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of ketones to alcohols. However, for the next step (ozonolysis) to work, an alkene must be formed. A plausible, albeit complex, pathway is:\n    1.  The initial reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH yields a rearranged, strained ketone (Product 1), such as **2,4-dehydroadamantanone**. This molecule contains a highly strained cyclopropyl ketone moiety.\n    2.  The ketone in Product 1 is reduced by Al(O-iPr)₃ to the corresponding alcohol.\n    3.  Upon heating in the presence of the Lewis-acidic aluminum species, the strained alcohol rearranges. Strained cyclopropylcarbinol systems are known to undergo ring-opening rearrangements to form stable alkenes. This rearrangement leads to the formation of **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene).\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** Product 2 is an alkene, **protoadamantene**, which contains a C=C double bond, allowing it to react in the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Process:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. The ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond of protoadamantene. The reductive workup with DMS ensures that the cleaved carbons become carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones) rather than carboxylic acids.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The ozonolysis of protoadamantene is a known reaction that cleaves one of the rings in the tricyclic system. The product is a bicyclic dialdehyde: **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**. This molecule consists of a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework with two aldehyde (-CHO) groups at positions 3 and 7.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern for Product 3**\n\n*   **Goal:** Find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable aldehyde protons).\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde exists preferentially in a chair-chair conformation. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C7, and the bridging C9 carbon.\n*   **Most Deshielded Protons:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are those on the carbons bearing the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. These are the methine protons at C3 and C7. Due to the molecule's symmetry, H3 and H7 are chemically equivalent. We need to find the splitting pattern for one of them, for instance, H3.\n*   **Neighbors of H3:** The H3 proton is on C3. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂-) groups. Therefore, H3 is coupled to four neighboring protons: two on C2 and two on C4.\n*   **Applying Splitting Rules:**\n    1.  Because of the symmetry plane, the two protons on C2 are in an environment equivalent to that of the two protons on C4.\n    2.  Let's consider the protons on C2: one is axial (H2ₐₓ) and one is equatorial (H2ₑq). The same applies to C4 (H4ₐₓ, H4ₑq).\n    3.  The H3 proton is coupled to two axial protons (H2ₐₓ and H4ₐₓ). These two protons are equivalent by symmetry, and they will couple to H3 with the same coupling constant, let's call it J₁. Coupling to these two equivalent protons will split the H3 signal into a **triplet**.\n    4.  The H3 proton is also coupled to two equatorial protons (H2ₑq and H4ₑq). These two protons are also equivalent by symmetry and will couple to H3 with a different coupling constant, J₂. This coupling will split each line of the first triplet into another **triplet**.\n    5.  The coupling constant between H3 and its axial neighbors (J₁) will generally be different from the coupling constant with its equatorial neighbors (J₂).\n*   **Final Pattern:** The resulting splitting pattern is a triplet of triplets (tt). Each of the three peaks from the first coupling is further split into three smaller peaks by the second coupling.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern for the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<D>>>"
