    "This problem requires us to calculate the ratio of the total masses of two binary star systems. The total mass of a binary system can be determined from its orbital period and the radial velocities of its component stars.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of `system_1` (M1) to the total mass of `system_2` (M2), which is `M1 / M2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** The total mass of a binary star system (`M = m1 + m2`) is related to the orbital period (`P`) and the orbital velocities (`v1`, `v2`) by Kepler's Third Law. For spectroscopic binaries, we measure the amplitudes of the radial velocities (`K1`, `K2`), which are the projections of the orbital velocities along our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Equation:** The formula for the total mass of a binary system, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n    `M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    where:\n    *   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars (`m1 + m2`).\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination angle of the orbit relative to the plane of the sky.\n\n4.  **Use Key Information:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a critical piece of information. For an eclipse to occur, the orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on. This implies that the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees. Therefore, `sin(i)` is approximately 1, and `sin³(i)` is also approximately 1. This simplifies the formula significantly.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Equation:** Assuming `sin³(i) = 1` for both systems, the formula becomes:\n    `M_total ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio `M1 / M2`. We can write out the expressions for `M1` and `M2` and then divide them.\n    `M1 ≈ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n    `M2 ≈ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n\n    When we take the ratio `M1 / M2`, the constant term `(2 * π * G)` cancels out:\n    `M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * ((K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b))³`\n\n7.  **Extract Values from the Problem:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   `P1 = 2` years\n        *   `K1a = 10` km/s\n        *   `K1b = 5` km/s\n        *   Total velocity amplitude `K1_total = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   `P2 = 1` year\n        *   `K2a = 15` km/s\n        *   `K2b = 10` km/s\n        *   Total velocity amplitude `K2_total = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Now, substitute these values into the ratio formula. The units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) are consistent within the ratio, so no conversion to SI units is necessary.\n    `M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n\n9.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    `M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\n10. **Compare with Options:** The calculated value `0.432` is very close to the value in option B, `~ 0.4`.\n\nI will use Python to perform the final calculation to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Values for System 1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_total = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# Values for System 2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_total = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# The ratio of the masses M1/M2 is proportional to (P * K_total^3)\n# The constants of proportionality cancel out in the ratio.\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
