    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. Let's check for chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n        *   C1 and C2 are `sp2` hybridized and part of a double bond; they cannot be chiral centers.\n        *   The CH2 carbon (C3) is bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms. Not a chiral center.\n        *   The terminal CH3 carbon (C4) is bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms. Not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, the entire molecule is planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule, a derivative of a norbornane-type skeleton.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name itself provides the crucial information.\n        *   The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of at least two stereocenters (at positions 3a and 7a) with a specific configuration.\n        *   A specific enantiomer is named. For a molecule to be named with specific `R` and `S` configurations for its stereocenters (and not be described as meso), it must be a chiral molecule.\n        *   Let's consider the possibility of it being a meso compound. The parent structure (without the C8 substituent) could potentially have a plane of symmetry. However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` which is `=CHCl` is located on the methano bridge of the norbornane system. This substituent is asymmetric and breaks any potential plane of symmetry in the parent skeleton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral, and a specific enantiomer is given. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n        *   The substituents on C2 and C3 are identical: -H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other -CH(CH3)COOH group.\n        *   When a molecule has multiple stereocenters and the groups on these centers are identical, there is a possibility of a meso form.\n        *   The specified configuration is `(2R,3S)`. For a molecule like this, the isomer with opposite configurations (one R, one S) has a plane of symmetry between the two stereocenters.\n        *   Let's visualize the Fischer projection for the (2R,3S) isomer.\n            ```\n                  COOH\n                   |\n            CH3 -- C -- H   (R)\n                   |\n              H -- C -- CH3   (S)\n                   |\n                  COOH\n            ```\n            There is a plane of symmetry cutting horizontally between C2 and C3.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral due to internal symmetry, making them optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule.\n        *   The configuration is `(2R,3R)`. This isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chiral molecule. A sample consisting of a single enantiomer like `(2R,3R)` will be optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's check for stereocenters.\n        *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, C2 (part of -CH=CH-), and C6 (part of -CH2-CH2-). Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n        *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral.\n        *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chiral molecule, and a specific enantiomer is given. It is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Analysis:** The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` is used to denote relative stereochemistry, typically meaning all three substituents are *cis* (on the same side of the ring).\n        *   Let's visualize the chair conformation. In the most stable conformation of the all-cis isomer, the three -OH groups can occupy the 1, 3, and 5 axial positions (all pointing \"up,\" for example).\n        *   This molecule, despite having stereocenters (C1, C3, C5), is highly symmetrical. It has a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom (e.g., the plane containing C1, O1, and C4).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's search for any chiral elements.\n        *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The -CH(CH3)2 group has two identical methyl groups, so the CH carbon is not chiral. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring have at least two identical substituents (either two hydrogens or two identical paths around the ring from the point of attachment).\n        *   **Other sources of chirality:** The molecule is not an allene, spirane, or atropisomer. There is free rotation around the single bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Compound                                                                        | Chiral?          | Optically Active? |\n| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------- | :---------------- |\n| (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene                                                  | No (Achiral)     | No                |\n| (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione       | Yes (Chiral)     | Yes               |\n| (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid                                               | No (Meso)        | No                |\n| (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid                                               | Yes (Chiral)     | Yes               |\n| (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol                                                          | Yes (Chiral)     | Yes               |\n| (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol                                              | No (Achiral)     | No                |\n| 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one                                               | No (Achiral)     | No                |\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity, we have three:\n1.
