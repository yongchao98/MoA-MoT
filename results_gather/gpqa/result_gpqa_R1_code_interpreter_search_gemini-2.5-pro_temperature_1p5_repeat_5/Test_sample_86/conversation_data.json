    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information from the Question:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituent groups attached. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I, let's denote it as -X) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This is one of the two substituents.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have two substituents: a halogen (-X) and a group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   Let's figure out the structure of the second substituent. It must have the formula C₂HᵧO.\n*   Possible structures for this C₂ substituent with a carbonyl group are:\n    *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH₃. This has 2 carbons and fits the description.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group:** -CH₂CHO. This also has 2 carbons and fits the description.\n*   Now, let's attach these possibilities to the halo-benzene ring.\n    *   **Structure I:** Halo-acetophenone (X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃)\n    *   **Structure II:** Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n*   Both structures have a total of 8 carbons (6 from the ring, 2 from the side chain), a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. They both fit the initial description.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\n\nTo distinguish between the two possibilities and the different substitution patterns (ortho, meta, para), let's predict what their 1H NMR spectra would look like. We need a total of 7 protons (4 on the ring, 3 on the side chain for acetophenone; 4 on the ring, 3 on the side chain for phenylacetaldehyde).\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for Halo-acetophenone (Structure I):**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4)**, the molecule is symmetric. We will see two signals, each a **doublet (d)** and each integrating to **2H**. This is a very characteristic pattern. The chemical shift will be in the aromatic region, ~7.4-8.0 ppm, because the acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing.\n        *   If the substitution is ortho or meta, the pattern will be more complex, with four distinct signals for the 4 protons.\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (Structure II):**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is adjacent to the -CH₂- group. It will appear as a **triplet (t)**, integrating to **1H**. It is highly deshielded and will appear far downfield, typically **~9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂-):** These two protons are adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO). They will appear as a **doublet (d)**, integrating to **2H**. The typical chemical shift is around **3.5-4.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons. A **para** substitution would again give a pattern of two **doublets (d)**, each for **2H**. Because the electron-withdrawing carbonyl is not directly attached to the ring, the chemical shifts would be less downfield than for acetophenone, perhaps around ~7.1-7.5 ppm.\n\n**4. Compare Predicted Spectra with the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too upfield. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows a signal at 9.9 ppm (aldehyde), two doublets in the aromatic region (para-substitution), and a signal at 3.7 ppm (methylene). This matches the functional groups of Structure II (halo-phenylacetaldehyde).\n    *   However, there are discrepancies: the aldehyde and methylene protons are shown as singlets (s), not a triplet and a doublet. Also, the aromatic protons are very far downfield (7.6-7.8 ppm), which is more typical for a group directly attached to the ring like in acetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option does not show a clear pattern for either proposed structure. It has signals outside the aromatic region and an unusual integration and multiplicity. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This is the classic, textbook pattern for a **para-substituted benzene ring**. It indicates 4 aromatic protons, split into two sets of 2.\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a perfect match for a **methyl group next to a carbonyl** (-C(=O)CH₃). A 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm is highly characteristic.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for **para-halo-acetophenone (Structure I)**. Every detail (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities) is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option D provides a perfect match for p-halo-acetophenone. This molecule fits all the criteria given in the question: it is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, it has 8 carbon atoms, it contains a carbonyl group, and it has an aromatic-halogen bond. The NMR data is a textbook example for this structure. While the data in option B has some features of halo-phenylacetaldehyde, it has significant inconsistencies in multiplicity and chemical shift, making D the far better answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
