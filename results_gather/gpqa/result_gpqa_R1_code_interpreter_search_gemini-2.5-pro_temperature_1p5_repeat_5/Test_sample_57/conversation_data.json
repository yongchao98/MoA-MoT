    "This question requires an understanding of a concept in theoretical physics known as \"regularization,\" specifically in the context of high energies (ultraviolet divergences).\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the core concept: Regularization at High Energies.**\n    In physics, particularly in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), when we try to calculate physical quantities (like the probability of a particle interaction), we often encounter mathematical expressions, typically integrals, that \"blow up\" to infinity. This usually happens when we integrate over all possible energies or momenta of virtual particles involved in the interaction, and the integral diverges at the high-energy end (the \"ultraviolet\" or UV limit).\n    *   **Regularization** is a mathematical trick to make these infinite integrals temporarily finite. It involves introducing a new, non-physical parameter called a \"regulator.\" A common example is imposing an energy \"cutoff,\" meaning we simply stop the integral at some very high but finite energy, Λ.\n    *   After regularization, a process called **renormalization** is used to absorb the parts of the calculation that depend on this cutoff into a redefinition of the fundamental constants of the theory (like the mass and charge of a particle).\n    *   A theory that \"requires regularization at high energies\" is one that has these inherent ultraviolet (UV) divergences in its mathematical formulation. A theory that *never* requires it would be \"UV finite,\" meaning its calculations yield finite results from the start, without any mathematical tricks.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option:**\n\n    *   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory describes electricity and magnetism using Maxwell's equations. While it's not a quantum theory, it has its own high-energy problem. If you calculate the energy stored in the electric field of a point-like particle (like an electron), the energy integral diverges as you get closer to the point (radius r → 0). This is equivalent to a high-energy divergence. To solve this, one must \"regularize\" the theory, for instance, by assuming the electron is not a point but has a small, finite radius. Thus, Classical Electrodynamics does face a divergence problem that requires a form of regularization.\n\n    *   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum version of electrodynamics. QED is the textbook example of a theory that *requires* regularization and renormalization. When calculating interactions using Feynman diagrams, loops of virtual particles lead to integrals that are logarithmically divergent at high energies. Without regularization, the theory would predict infinite values for measurable quantities, which is nonsensical.\n\n    *   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the theory of the strong nuclear force, which binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons. Like QED, QCD is a quantum field theory. It also involves loop diagrams and suffers from UV divergences that must be handled by regularization and renormalization.\n\n    *   **C) Superstring Theory:** This theory is a departure from the \"point particle\" concept that underlies all the other theories listed. In string theory, the fundamental entities are not points but tiny, vibrating one-dimensional strings. A key motivation and celebrated feature of string theory is that it appears to be **UV finite**. The interactions between strings are not localized at a single point in spacetime. Instead, they are \"smeared out\" as the strings merge and split. This smearing effect naturally smooths out the high-energy behavior that leads to divergences in point-particle theories. Calculations of scattering amplitudes in string theory have been shown to be finite without the need for regularization. This is a major reason why it is considered a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity, as attempts to quantize gravity with standard QFT methods lead to uncontrollable (non-renormalizable) infinities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, Classical Electrodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Quantum Chromodynamics all suffer from divergences at high energies/short distances that require a regularization procedure to be made physically meaningful. Superstring Theory, by virtue of its fundamental objects being extended strings rather than points, is believed to be free of these ultraviolet divergences and therefore does not require regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
