    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Express the potential in Cartesian coordinates.**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n$V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\nTo simplify the problem, we convert this potential into Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The transformation rules are:\n$x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n$y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n$r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential expression, we get:\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(\\theta))^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n\nNow, group the terms with $x^2$ and $y^2$:\n$V(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k\\right) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{4}{2} k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n$V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n**2. Analyze the Hamiltonian.**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a particle of mass m in two dimensions is:\n$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(x, y)$\nIn Cartesian coordinates, this becomes:\n$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\right) + 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\nWe can see that the potential $V(x,y)$ is a sum of a function of $x$ only and a function of $y$ only ($V(x,y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$). This means the Hamiltonian is separable:\n$H = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + 2 k x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2\\right)$\n$H = H_x + H_y$\n\nSince the Hamiltonian is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y components: $E = E_x + E_y$.\n\n**3. Solve the one-dimensional problems.**\n\nBoth $H_x$ and $H_y$ are the Hamiltonians for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The standard potential for a 1D QHO is $V_{QHO}(z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$, and its energy eigenvalues are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n*   **For the x-component:**\n    The potential is $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$. We equate this to the standard form to find the angular frequency $\\omega_x$:\n    $\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_x^2 x^2 = 2 k x^2$\n    $\\omega_x^2 = \\frac{4k}{m} \\implies \\omega_x = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right)$\n\n*   **For the y-component:**\n    The potential is $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$. We find the angular frequency $\\omega_y$:\n    $\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_y^2 y^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $\\omega_y^2 = \\frac{k}{m} \\implies \\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**4. Calculate the total energy spectrum.**\n\nThe total energy is the sum $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$:\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nFactor out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n$E = \\left[ 2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = \\left[ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nThis result corresponds to the energy spectrum of the system, where $n_x$ and $n_y$ are non-negative integer quantum numbers.\n\n**5. Compare with the given options.**\n\nThe derived energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\nThis matches option B.\n\nA) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n<<<B>>>"
