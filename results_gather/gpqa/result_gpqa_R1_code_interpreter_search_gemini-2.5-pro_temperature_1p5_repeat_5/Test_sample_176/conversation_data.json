    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 (L1 / L2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = A * σ * T⁴\n    where:\n    *   L is the luminosity.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   A is the surface area of the star, which is 4πR² for a spherical star with radius R.\n    *   T is the star's effective surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the luminosity for each star:\n    *   L1 = (4πR₁²) * σ * T₁⁴\n    *   L2 = (4πR₂²) * σ * T₂⁴\n\n    To find the ratio L1 / L2, we divide the first equation by the second:\n    L1 / L2 = ( (4πR₁²) * σ * T₁⁴ ) / ( (4πR₂²) * σ * T₂⁴ )\n\n    The constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    L1 / L2 = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information for the Radius Ratio:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    *   Therefore, the ratio (R₁ / R₂) = 1.5.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T₁ / T₂):** This is the most complex part.\n    *   The astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest (`λ_max,obs`). This observed peak wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect.\n    *   The intrinsic peak wavelength (`λ_max,emit`) is related to the star's true surface temperature (T) by Wien's Displacement Law: `λ_max,emit = b / T`, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    *   The relationship between the observed and emitted wavelength is given by the formula for Doppler shift: `λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c)`, where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Apply the Doppler Shift to Both Stars:**\n    *   For Star_1: `v₁ = 0 km/s`. So, its observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted peak wavelength: `λ_max,obs,1 = λ_max,emit,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_max,emit,1`.\n    *   For Star_2: `v₂ = 700 km/s`. Its observed peak wavelength is shifted: `λ_max,obs,2 = λ_max,emit,2 * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n\n7.  **Connect Temperature and Observed Wavelength:** The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_max,obs,1 = λ_max,obs,2`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions from the previous step:\n        `λ_max,emit,1 = λ_max,emit,2 * (1 + v₂/c)`\n    *   Now, substitute Wien's Law (`λ_max,emit = b / T`):\n        `(b / T₁) = (b / T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)`\n    *   The constant 'b' cancels out:\n        `1 / T₁ = (1 / T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)`\n    *   Rearranging to find the temperature ratio (T₁ / T₂):\n        `T₂ / T₁ = (1 + v₂/c)`\n        `T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Now we have all the components. Substitute the radius ratio and the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    *   L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * ( 1 / (1 + v₂/c) )⁴\n    *   We know:\n        *   (1.5)² = 2.25\n        *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n        *   c ≈ 299792.458 km/s (speed of light)\n\n    Let's compute the value.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants and given values\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\nv2 = 700.0  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nc = 299792.458  # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio T1/T2\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)\ntemperature_ratio = 1.0 / (1.0 + v2 / c)\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio L1/L2\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (temperature_ratio)**4\n\nprint(f\"{luminosity_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The code calculated the final luminosity ratio to be approximately 2.23. Let's break down how this result was obtained.\n\n**Reasoning Breakdown**\n\n1.  **Luminosity and the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is determined by its surface area (A) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = σ * A * T⁴\n    Since a star is a sphere, its surface area is A = 4πR², where R is the radius. So the full formula is:\n    L = σ * 4πR² * T⁴\n\n2.  **Forming the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of Star 1's luminosity to Star 2's luminosity (L₁ / L₂).\n    L₁ / L₂ = (σ * 4πR₁² * T₁⁴) / (σ * 4πR₂² * T₂⁴)\n    The constants (σ, 4, π) cancel out, leaving a simpler relationship:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio (R₁/R₂):** The problem explicitly states that Star 1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star 2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    *   Therefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    *   (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):** This is the more complex part.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a star's true surface temperature (T) to the *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emit) at which it shines brightest: λ_emit = b / T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means T = b / λ_emit.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The star's motion affects the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   **Combining the Laws:** The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n        *   For Star 1 (v₁ = 0): λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emit,1.\n        *   For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n        *   Setting them equal: λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n    *   **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** Now we substitute λ_emit = b/T back into this equation:\n        *   b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + 700/c)\n        *   1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + 700/c)\n        *   Rearranging to solve for T₁/T₂ gives: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we plug everything back into our luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1 / (1 + 700/c))⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + 700 / 299792.458))⁴\n\nThe python code executed this final calculation, which yielded:\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.23\n\nThe information about the stars' masses was extra information not needed to solve the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>"
