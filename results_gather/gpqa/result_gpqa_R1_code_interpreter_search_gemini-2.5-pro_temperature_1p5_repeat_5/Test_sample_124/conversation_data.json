    "An analysis of the problem of a quantum mechanical particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its Energy Levels**\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, which describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$). The potential becomes $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.\n\nThe total Hamiltonian is the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n\nThe energy eigenvalue of a 1D harmonic oscillator in the state $n_i$ is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i=0, 1, 2, \\dots$\n\nTherefore, the total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies in each dimension:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nWe can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then characterized by this single number $n$:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, for $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots$\n\n**2. Identify the Third Excited State and its Energy**\nWe need to find the energy of the *third excited state*. Let's list the first few energy levels:\n*   **Ground state:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when $n=0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First excited state:** This corresponds to the next energy level, $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second excited state:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third excited state:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n$n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$\n\nWe can list all the possible combinations:\n*   Combinations with a '3': (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3). This gives 3 states.\n*   Combinations with a '2': (2, 1, 0) and all its unique permutations: (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2). This gives 6 states.\n*   Combinations with only '1's: (1, 1, 1). This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ for a level $n$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be calculated using the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$ - Incorrect\nB) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$ - Incorrect degeneracy\nC) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$ - Correct\nD) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$ - Incorrect energy\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
