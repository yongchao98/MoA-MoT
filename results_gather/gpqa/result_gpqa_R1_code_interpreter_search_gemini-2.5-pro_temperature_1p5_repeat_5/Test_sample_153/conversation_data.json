    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires combining information from multiple spectroscopic techniques. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue is 156 g/mol.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   There is a very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimerization.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This immediately makes options B (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates, while ruling out A (phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and D (3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Peak at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-CO**O**H). The integration confirms it is a single proton (1H). It is a singlet because acidic protons typically do not couple with other protons. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Peaks in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm):** There are two distinct signals.\n        *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** A signal for two equivalent aromatic protons. The doublet multiplicity means they are coupled to one neighboring proton.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** A signal for two other equivalent aromatic protons. The doublet multiplicity also indicates they are coupled to one neighboring proton.\n    *   This pattern—two doublets, each integrating to two protons—is a classic signature for a *para*- (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the ring makes the two protons on one side equivalent to the two protons on the other.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Ruled out by IR and NMR (no carboxylic acid).\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid, consistent with IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. This lack of symmetry means there would be four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid.\n        *   **MS:** Molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. Let's calculate the MW: (7*12) + (5*1) + 35 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches. It contains Cl, also a match.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. This matches.\n        *   **NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm). It has a *para*-disubstituted ring, which would produce the observed symmetrical pattern of two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm). This is a perfect match for all the data.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Ruled out by IR and NMR (it's an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the aromatic NMR pattern would be different).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
