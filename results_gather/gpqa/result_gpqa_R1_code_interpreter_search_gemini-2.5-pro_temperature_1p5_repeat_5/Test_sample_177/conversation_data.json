    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density\n\nIn a 4-dimensional spacetime and using natural units where the reduced Planck constant `ħ` and the speed of light `c` are set to 1 (`ħ = c = 1`), the action `S` is a dimensionless quantity. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d⁴x L`\n\nFrom this, we can determine the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density.\n*   The action `S` is dimensionless, so its mass dimension is `[S] = 0`.\n*   The spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has dimensions of `(length)⁴`. Since mass and length have inverse dimensions (`[Length] = [Mass]⁻¹`), the mass dimension of `d⁴x` is `[d⁴x] = [Mass]⁻⁴`.\n\nFor the action to be dimensionless, we must have:\n`[S] = [d⁴x][L] = 0`\n`[Mass]⁻⁴ [L] = [Mass]⁰`\nTherefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density `L` must be 4:\n`[L] = 4`\n\n### 2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields\n\nTo find the mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ`, we first need the mass dimensions of the fields `ψ` and `F^μν`. We can deduce these from their respective kinetic terms in the standard model Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion field `ψ`**: The kinetic term for a fermion is `L_kinetic_fermion = iψ̄γ^μ∂_μψ`.\n    *   The dimension of the Lagrangian density must be 4: `[L_kinetic_fermion] = 4`.\n    *   The derivative `∂_μ` has a mass dimension of 1: `[∂_μ] = 1`.\n    *   The gamma matrices `γ^μ` are dimensionless matrices: `[γ^μ] = 0`.\n    *   The fields `ψ` and `ψ̄` have the same mass dimension: `[ψ] = [ψ̄]`.\n\n    Putting it together:\n    `[ψ̄][γ^μ][∂_μ][ψ] = 4`\n    `[ψ] * 0 * 1 * [ψ]` is not the right way to think about dimensions. We sum the dimensions of the factors in a term.\n    `[ψ̄] + [γ^μ] + [∂_μ] + [ψ] = 4` is also wrong. We multiply the dimensions, not add them. Let's restart the field dimension analysis more carefully.\n    `[L_kinetic_fermion] = [ψ̄] [γ^μ] [∂_μ] [ψ]`. Let's denote mass dimension of `X` as `[X]`.\n    `[L] = [ψ̄] [∂_μ] [ψ]`\n    `4 = [ψ] * 1 * [ψ]` since `[ψ̄] = [ψ]` and `[γ^μ]` is dimensionless.\n    `4 = [ψ]² * 1`\n    This logic is also flawed. The correct dimensional analysis is: `[L] = 4`, so `[iψ̄γ^μ∂_μψ] = 4`.\n    `[ψ̄] + [∂_μ] + [ψ] = 4`. (This is standard practice for dimensional analysis of terms in a Lagrangian). Let's be very explicit:\n    Let `d` be the mass dimension of `ψ`. So `[ψ] = d`. Then `[ψ̄] = d`.\n    The mass dimension of `∂_μ` is 1.\n    The overall dimension of the term is the sum of the mass dimensions of its components:\n    `[ψ̄] + [∂_μ] + [ψ] = d + 1 + d = 2d + 1`.\n    We equate this to the dimension of the Lagrangian density:\n    `2d + 1 = 4`\n    `2d = 3`\n    `d = 3/2`\n    So, the mass dimension of the fermion field is `[ψ] = [ψ̄] = 3/2`.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor `F^μν`**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_kinetic_photon = -1/4 F_μν F^μν`.\n    *   `[L_kinetic_photon] = 4`.\n    *   `[F_μν F^μν] = [F_μν] + [F^μν] = 2[F^μν]`.\n    *   So, `2[F^μν] = 4`, which gives `[F^μν] = 2`.\n    The mass dimension of the field strength tensor is `[F^μν] = 2`.\n\n*   **Sigma tensor `σ_μν`**: It is defined as `σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. Since the gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless. Thus, `[σ_μν] = 0`.\n\n### 3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling `κ`\n\nNow we can analyze the given interaction Lagrangian:\n`L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^μν`\n\nThe dimension of this interaction term must also be 4.\n`[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F^μν] = 4`\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n`[κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 5 = 4`\n`[κ] = -1`\n\nThe mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` is -1.\n\n### 4. Renormalizability\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be assessed by examining the mass dimensions of its coupling constants. The rule is as follows:\n*   **Super-renormalizable**: All coupling constants have a positive mass dimension.\n*   **Renormalizable**: All coupling constants have a mass dimension of zero.\n*   **Non-renormalizable**: At least one coupling constant has a negative mass dimension.\n\nIn this theory, the coupling constant `κ` has a mass dimension of `[κ] = -1`. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction is described by a non-renormalizable theory. Such interactions, often called higher-dimensional operators, cause uncontrollable divergences at high energies in perturbation theory, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to absorb them. This makes the theory lose its predictive power at high energy scales.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of `κ` is -1, and because this is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
