    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm-1** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, where the broadening is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at **1610 cm-1** and **1450 cm-1** suggest the presence of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet integrating to one proton, located far downfield, is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is a tell-tale pattern for a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons meta to the -COOH group.\n    *   So far, we have a 4-substituted benzoic acid structure. Now we must identify the substituent at the 4-position from the remaining signals.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton. Its chemical shift suggests it's a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). Let's call this proton Ha.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons. This indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a carbon with only one proton (a CH group). This methyl group must be attached to the carbon bearing Ha. Let's call these protons Hc.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons. This indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a CH2 group). This is a terminal methyl group of an ethyl fragment. Let's call these protons Hd.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons. This must be the CH2 group that is adjacent to both the terminal methyl group (Hd) and the benzylic methine group (Ha). Let's call these protons Hb.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   The alkyl substituent has a central CH (Ha) attached to the ring.\n    *   This CH (Ha) is also attached to a CH3 group (Hc, the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n    *   This CH (Ha) is also attached to a CH2 group (Hb, the 1.7 ppm multiplet).\n    *   The CH2 group (Hb) is attached to a terminal CH3 group (Hd, the 0.9 ppm triplet).\n    *   Putting it all together: Ring-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   Compound X reacts with **red phosphorus and HI**. This is a powerful reducing agent combination.\n    *   This reagent is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3). It will also reduce ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols to their corresponding alkanes, but it will not affect the aromatic ring or the existing alkyl groups.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   Reaction: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Product: The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged. The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, not the final product.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: The alkyl group is isobutyl, not sec-butyl.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the predicted structure of the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
