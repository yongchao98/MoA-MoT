    "This problem requires us to determine the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone. To act as a nucleophile, it must first be deprotonated by a base to form an enolate. The possible positions for deprotonation are the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The α-carbons are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon. It has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will readily deprotonate the only available α-hydrogen at C6.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the CH₂ group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate Formation):** The t-BuOK base removes the proton from C6 of the ketone, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate. The nucleophilic character resides on C6.\n    *   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition):** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The π electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons of the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming an enolate intermediate from the acrylate moiety.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The intermediate is protonated (e.g., by tert-butanol formed in the first step or during aqueous workup) at the α-carbon of the original acrylate to yield the final product, A.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The original ketone structure remains, but now C6 is bonded to a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   Let's analyze the name provided in the options: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n        *   This name treats the product as an ethyl propanoate derivative. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n        *   Let's check if the substituent name, `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`, matches our product. The `-yl` indicates the point of attachment is C1 of the ring.\n            *   Attachment point (our old C6) is numbered as C1. It has a methyl group. This matches \"**1-methyl**\".\n            *   The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (our old C1) is numbered as C2. This matches \"**2-oxo**\".\n            *   The next carbon (our old C2), which has an ethyl and a methyl group, is numbered C3. This matches \"**3-ethyl**\" and \"**3-methyl**\".\n        *   The name is a valid, though complex, IUPAC name for the resulting structure.\n    *   The name provided in options B and D, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, suggests a 1,4-relationship between the attachment point and the oxo group, which is inconsistent with a Michael addition starting from an enolate formed adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   Therefore, product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The nitro group (NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-hydrogens (on the carbon attached to NO₂) acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the CH group attached to the methyl group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Carbanion Formation):** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an α-proton from 1-nitropropane, creating a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion).\n    *   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition):** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate ion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product, B.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Let's trace the atoms:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `(NO₂)-CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `(CN)-CH₂-CH-(CH₃)`\n        *   Combining them gives the skeleton: `(NO₂)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:**\n        *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent name ends in \"-nitrile\".\n        *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. Thus, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   Numbering begins from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n        *   The substituents are a methyl group on C3 and a nitro group on C4.\n        *   The final name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for B given in options A and D. The name in options B and C, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`, is incorrect as it describes a different molecular structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results, we find that only option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
