    "An organic moiety shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation, as seen in some substituted biphenyls or allenes). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n    *   Rotation around this single bond is severely restricted due to the presence of four large substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) and two nitro groups (-NO₂).\n    *   This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, forces the two phenyl rings to be non-coplanar.\n    *   The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). It exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   This compound is also known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Thus, it exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅.\n    *   The central carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group, meaning it is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen atom). There are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   The structure is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making it achiral.\n    *   It also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Being achiral, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not. Therefore, the correct choice includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
