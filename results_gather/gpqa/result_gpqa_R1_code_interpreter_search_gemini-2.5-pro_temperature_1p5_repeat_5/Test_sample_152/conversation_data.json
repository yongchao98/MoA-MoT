    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate from dimethyl malonate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound, we can identify the main carbon chain. A common, albeit simplified, way to name such products is to consider the three-carbon chain formed by the malonate α-carbon, the acrylate β-carbon, and the acrylate α-carbon as the backbone.\n        *   C1: The carbon from dimethyl malonate, which has two methyl carboxylate groups attached (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`).\n        *   C2: The β-carbon from the acrylate, which has the p-tolyl group attached (`-CH(p-tolyl)-`).\n        *   C3: The α-carbon from the acrylate, which is now a `-CH₂-` attached to the third methyl carboxylate group (`-CH₂-COOCH₃`).\n    *   This structure corresponds to a trimethyl ester of 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   Thus, **Product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.**\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael reaction.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a resonance-stabilized carbanion on the nitrile portion.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) has two roles: first, to protonate the carbanion intermediate, and second, to hydrolyze the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The hydrolysis step converts the enamine functionality back to the original ketone, cyclohexanone.\n    *   A new substituent, derived from the but-2-enenitrile, is attached to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone (the carbon that was the β-carbon of the enamine).\n    *   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at the 2-position.\n    *   To name this compound, we can consider butanenitrile as the parent chain. The cyano group (`-CN`) is carbon 1.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n    *   A 2-oxocyclohexyl group is attached at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Thus, **Product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.**\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   In the Michael reaction, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂`) and a proton adds to the α-carbon (`CH`). This means the fragment `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃` (a 3-oxobutyl group) from MVK is added to the nucleophile.\n    *   The product structure shows this exact `3-oxobutyl` group attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Reactant C:**\n    *   The fragment that is not derived from MVK is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, with the connection at C2.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (the methylene group between two carbonyls) are highly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, **Reactant C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches the descriptions in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
