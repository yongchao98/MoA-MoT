    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **Pyran:** A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro:** The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position.\n*   The combination of these features describes a delta-lactone (a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring).\n*   The molecule has a single chiral center at C4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      O\n     / \\\n  H2C   C=O\n /   \\ /\nH2C--CH-CH2CH3\n   \\ /\n    CH2\n   (C4 has the chiral center)\n```\n*   Reaction 1 yields the `(R)` enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the `(S)` enantiomer.\n\n**2. Determine the Immediate Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxycarboxylic acids. To find the precursor, we can conceptually hydrolyze the lactone by breaking the ester bond within the ring. This adds a hydroxyl (-OH) group to one end and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group to the other.\n\nCleavage of the C2-O1 bond results in `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`:\n`HO-CH2(5)-CH2(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\nThe chiral center of this precursor acid is at C3, which corresponds to C4 in the lactone product. The lactonization process does not change the stereochemistry at this chiral center.\n*   To form `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, we need `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   To form `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, we need `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Let's break down the structure:\n*   **Main chain:** pentanoic acid with a free COOH group at C1.\n*   **Substituents:** an ethyl group at C3 and an isobutoxycarbonyl group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at C5.\nThe structure is: `(isobutyl)-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\nThis molecule possesses both an ester functional group and a carboxylic acid functional group. The chiral center is at C3, which will be preserved throughout the reactions.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a reducing agent. We must consider its chemoselectivity.\n*   **Selectivity:** `LiBH4` readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but reduces carboxylic acids very slowly. In a molecule containing both functional groups, `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) in compound A is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` is converted to `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\n    4.  This resulting `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization (`H+` workup) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization do not affect the stereocenter. Therefore, to obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must have the `(R)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A is `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH3`) is another reducing agent.\n*   **Selectivity:** `BH3` is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly. In a molecule with both groups, `BH3` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) in compound B is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` is converted to `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    4.  During the acidic workup (`H+`), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereocenter is not affected by this sequence. To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must have the `(S)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B is `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A = `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`\n*   Starting material B = `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
