    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to identify which pair of compounds, from the given options and in a 1:1 mixture, would produce the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are two signals.\n    *   Both signals are singlets.\n    *   The integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This means the mixture contains two types of aromatic protons that are not equivalent to each other. Each type gives a singlet, meaning its protons have no adjacent proton neighbors to cause splitting. Since the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, each singlet must arise from the same number of protons in its respective molecule.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are three signals.\n    *   All signals are singlets. This indicates the protons (likely from methyl groups) are not adjacent to any other non-equivalent protons.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** Let the total number of aliphatic protons be 'N'. The three signals represent groups of protons in the ratio of (2/4)*N, (1/4)*N, and (1/4)*N.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nFirst, let's confirm all candidates have the molecular formula C10H14. All four are isomers of tetramethylbenzene or diethylbenzene, with the formula C6H2(CH3)4 or C6H4(C2H5)2, both of which are C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry (two perpendicular planes of symmetry), all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   This makes the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) equivalent.\n    *   This also makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** Three singlets with an integration of 6H (from Me-1 + Me-3), 3H (from Me-2), and 3H (from Me-5). The ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   The two aromatic protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent but are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. Such an A2 (or more accurately, AA') system appears as a singlet.\n    *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** Two singlets, one for Me-1+Me-4 (6H) and one for Me-2+Me-3 (6H). The ratio is 6:6 or **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 and CH3 protons within the ethyl group are not equivalent and will couple.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** One quartet (4H, from the -CH2-) and one triplet (6H, from the -CH3-). This does not match the data stating all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, and so can option C.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nThe mixture's spectrum is the sum of the spectra of the two components. We need a combination that gives **two aromatic singlets** (1:1 ratio) and **three aliphatic singlets** (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nSince 1,2,4,5-TMB, 1,2,3,5-TMB, and 1,2,3,4-TMB all produce a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region, any 1:1 mixture of two of these will produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (assuming slightly different chemical shifts, which is expected). So, the deciding factor will be the aliphatic region.\n\nLet's examine the aliphatic signals for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet.\n    *   Total signals: up to 5 singlets. To get the observed 3 signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, significant and specific signal overlap would be required. This is a complex and less likely scenario.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Total signals: This combination naturally provides **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental data without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet, and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Total signals: four singlets. To match the observed spectrum, we would have to assume that the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are \"accidentally degenerate\" (have the exact same chemical shift) and appear as a single 6H peak. This would result in signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H (from the overlap), giving a 2:1:1 ratio. While possible, it is an assumption.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option B) directly and simply explains all features of the observed NMR spectrum. It provides two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with an exact 2:1:1 integration ratio (12H:6H:6H) without needing to assume any accidental signal overlap. This is the most straightforward and chemically sound explanation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
