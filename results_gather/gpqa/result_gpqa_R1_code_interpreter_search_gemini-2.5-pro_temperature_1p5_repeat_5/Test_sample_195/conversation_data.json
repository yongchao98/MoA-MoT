    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In any isolated system, the total energy is conserved. For this relativistic oscillator, the total energy `E` is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n\n2.  **Define the energy components.**\n    *   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, `F = -kx`. The potential energy stored in the spring when the mass is at position `x` from the equilibrium is the work done against this force, which is:\n        $U(x) = \\int_0^x kx' dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    *   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a particle of mass `m` moving at speed `v` is given by Einstein's formula $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where `m` is the rest mass, `c` is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n        This particle energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the relativistic kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n\n3.  **Formulate the conservation of energy equation.**\n    The total conserved energy `E_total` of the oscillator system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    This total energy remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the energy at the point of maximum amplitude (x = A).**\n    *   At the maximum displacement, `x = A`, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction. Therefore, its speed is `v = 0`.\n    *   When `v = 0`, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n5.  **Analyze the energy at the point of maximum speed (x = 0).**\n    *   The mass reaches its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$, as it passes through the equilibrium position, `x = 0`.\n    *   At `x = 0`, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, corresponding to $v_{max}$: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n6.  **Equate the energies and solve for v_max.**\n    Since total energy is conserved, the energy at maximum amplitude must equal the energy at maximum speed:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2} \\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n    Finally, substitute the expression we found for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
