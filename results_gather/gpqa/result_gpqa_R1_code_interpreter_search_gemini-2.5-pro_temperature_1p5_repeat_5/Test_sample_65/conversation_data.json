    "The user wants to identify the fundamental symmetries that all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) must respect. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** The Standard Model (SM) is a relativistic quantum field theory, meaning it is invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). SMEFT is built as an extension of the SM, maintaining this fundamental principle. All SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry:** This is a broader symmetry group that includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. Just like Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré invariance is a cornerstone of the Standard Model and any local quantum field theory describing particle physics. SMEFT operators are built from fields at the same spacetime point (or their derivatives), which ensures translational invariance. As such, the entire framework is designed to be Poincaré invariant.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** This is the combined symmetry of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). The Standard Model itself is known to violate CP symmetry, as observed in the weak interactions (e.g., through the CKM matrix in the quark sector). SMEFT is designed to parameterize potential new physics, including new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. The Wilson coefficients of many SMEFT operators can be complex, explicitly introducing CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** This is the combined symmetry of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory, which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Lorentz Symmetry:** Must be respected.\n*   **Poincaré Symmetry:** Must be respected.\n*   **CP Symmetry:** Is not required to be respected.\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** Must be respected.\n\nThe symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to items 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
