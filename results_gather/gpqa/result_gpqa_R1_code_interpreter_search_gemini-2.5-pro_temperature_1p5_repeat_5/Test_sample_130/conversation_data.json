    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction and the spectroscopic data of its products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene:** The simplest such acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, commonly known as maleic acid.\n    *   **Dehydration to an anhydride:** Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride. Let's verify the NMR data provided for this anhydride.\n        *   Structure: Maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring containing an oxygen atom, two carbonyl (C=O) groups, and a C=C double bond. The structure is planar and symmetrical.\n        *   ¹H NMR: Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent. Therefore, they should produce a single peak. The problem states a single peak at 7 ppm, which is a typical chemical shift for vinylic protons deshielded by adjacent carbonyl groups. This matches maleic anhydride.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: There are two distinct types of carbon atoms. The two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent. This should result in two signals. The problem states two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons), which are characteristic shifts for these functional groups. This confirms the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **The other reactant:** The problem states the anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The cyclopentadiene provides the 4-π electron system, and the double bond of maleic anhydride provides the 2-π electron system.\n    *   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n        *   ***Endo* product:** The electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is oriented on the same side as the newly formed double bond bridge. This is typically the kinetically favored and therefore the **major product**.\n        *   ***Exo* product:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side of the double bond bridge. This is typically the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored, and therefore the **minor product**.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Check:**\n        *   Diene (C9H14) + Dienophile (C4H2O3) → Adduct (C13H16O3). This matches the formula provided in the problem.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   We need to find a feature in the 2D NOESY spectrum that distinguishes the major (*endo*) from the minor (*exo*) product. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **Let's visualize the structures:**\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond of the bicyclic system. This brings the two protons from the maleic anhydride moiety very close to the two vinyl methyl groups on that C=C bond.\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C=C double bond. In this conformation, the anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups.\n    *   **The Key NOESY Correlation:** The spatial proximity between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups is unique to the *endo* isomer. Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the signals for these two groups of protons will be present (or strong) in the spectrum of the major product (*endo*) and absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product (*exo*).\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectrum.\n    *   **Vinyl methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. They will appear as a 6H singlet. Being allylic, their typical chemical shift is around 1.5-2.0 ppm. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the best fit.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated, quaternary bridgehead carbons. They are in a shielded environment and will appear as a 6H singlet at a higher field (lower ppm). The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** is the best fit for these.\n    *   **Anhydride protons:** These are two equivalent protons, each adjacent to two carbonyl groups. They are heavily deshielded and will appear as a 2H singlet. Their chemical shift will be far downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the best fit.\n    *   **Methylene bridge protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (non-equivalent) and couple to each other, forming two doublets (an AB quartet). One of these would correspond to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   Based on our analysis, the cross-peak that distinguishes the major product is between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinyl methyl groups**.\n    *   Using our signal assignments:\n        *   Anhydride protons = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   Vinyl methyl groups = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me). Incorrect.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge CH) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). This interaction would be stronger in the *exo* product. Incorrect.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge CH). Incorrect.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). **Correct**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
