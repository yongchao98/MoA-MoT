    "Here is a breakdown of the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the State Vector**: The electron's spin state is given by the vector `|ψ⟩`, which can be represented as a column vector:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = [3i]\n          [ 4]\n    ```\n\n2.  **Define the Spin Operator in the y-direction (S_y)**: The spin operator `S_y` is related to the Pauli matrix `σ_y` by the formula `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n    Given:\n    ```\n    σ_y = [[0, -i],\n           [i,  0]]\n    ```\n    So,\n    ```\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],\n                   [i,  0]]\n    ```\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value**: The expectation value `⟨S_y⟩` of the operator `S_y` for a state `|ψ⟩` is calculated using the formula:\n    ```\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩\n    ```\n    where `⟨ψ|` is the bra vector, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector `|ψ⟩`.\n\n    *   **Step 3a: Find the bra vector `⟨ψ|`**\n        The conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]` is `⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4]`.\n\n    *   **Step 3b: Calculate the normalization factor `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i]`\n        `                   [ 4]`\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16`\n        Since `i² = -1`, `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 9 + 16 = 25`.\n\n    *   **Step 3c: Calculate the term `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩`**\n        First, let's find the result of `S_y|ψ⟩`:\n        `S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i]`\n        `                                     [ 4]`\n        `S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ] = (ħ/2) * [-4i]`\n        `                 [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]           [ 3i²]`\n        `S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]`\n\n        Now, multiply this by `⟨ψ|`:\n        `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i]`\n        `                                 [-3 ]`\n        `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ((-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3))`\n        `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * (12i² - 12)`\n        `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-12 - 12) = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ`\n\n    *   **Step 3d: Combine the results to find `⟨S_y⟩`**\n        `⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is `-12ħ/25`. Comparing this to the given options, we find it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
