    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This suggests isotopic labeling.\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance B's melting point is ~277 K.** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 3: The heavy isotope is Deuterium (D).** Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope mentioned in the first clue must be deuterium (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 4: Analysis of the reaction.**\n        *   Substance X (containing D) reacts violently with liquid Y.\n        *   A precipitate G is formed.\n        *   Heating G releases B (D₂O). This implies G is a compound that can be dehydrated (or \"de-deuterated\"), such as a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, a metal deuteroxide M(OD)ₓ when heated would yield a metal oxide and D₂O.\n        *   For G to be a metal deuteroxide, liquid Y must be the source of the OD group, meaning **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   A gas W is released, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider the reaction between a metal deuteride (a plausible form for X) and heavy water (Y). For example: M-D + D₂O → M-OD + D₂. Let's check the gas **W = D₂**. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   So far, we know X is a substance containing a metal and deuterium. The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂(gas) + G(precipitate).\n    *   **Clue 5: X or its analog is a reagent in organic chemistry.** The most common hydride reagents (whose deuterated analogs are also used) are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated versions are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Let's test these candidates:\n        *   If X = NaBD₄: The reaction with D₂O would be NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂. However, both sodium deuteroxide (NaOD) and boric acid (B(OD)₃) are soluble in water. No precipitate (G) would form. This contradicts the clues.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄: The reaction with D₂O is LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is a gelatinous precipitate**. This fits the description of G.\n    *   **Clue 6: Heating G releases B.** If G is Al(OD)₃, heating it would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This reaction releases D₂O (B), which also matches the clues.\n    *   **Clue 7: The keto acid reaction.** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (R-C(=O)-COOH). Substance X (LiAlD₄) and its analog LiAlH₄ are powerful reducing agents that would reduce both functional groups to alcohols. The product would be a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This final clue confirms our identification.\n\n3.  **Conclusion: Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from hydrogen = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass from aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the masses calculated above.\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
