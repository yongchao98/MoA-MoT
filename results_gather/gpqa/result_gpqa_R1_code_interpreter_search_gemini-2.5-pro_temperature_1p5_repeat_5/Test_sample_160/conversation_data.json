    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the two Mean Free Paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual *gas molecules* in the vacuum. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. The primary factors are the number density of the gas molecules (n) and the collision cross-section between two molecules (σ_gg, the gas-kinetic cross-section).\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the *beam electrons* traveling through the residual gas. It represents the average distance a 1000 keV electron travels before being scattered by a gas molecule. The primary factors are the same number density of gas molecules (n) and the scattering cross-section between an electron and a gas molecule (σ_eg).\n\n2.  **Formulate the equations for MFP:**\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a particle in a gas of similar particles is:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        The √2 factor accounts for the fact that the target gas molecules are also moving, not stationary.\n\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a very fast projectile (like a high-energy electron) moving through a gas of relatively slow-moving molecules is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        Here, the √2 factor is omitted because the target gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary compared to the relativistic speed of the 1000 keV electrons.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Kinetic Cross-Section):** This is related to the physical size of the gas molecules. It describes the effective area for a \"billiard ball\" type collision between two neutral molecules. For a typical gas like N2, this is on the order of 10⁻¹⁵ cm².\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron Scattering Cross-Section):** This describes the effective area for an electron to be scattered by a gas molecule. The interaction is electromagnetic (Coulombic). The magnitude of this cross-section is highly dependent on the electron's energy.\n        *   For *low-energy* electrons (a few eV), the interaction time is long, and the cross-section can be quite large, sometimes larger than the gas-kinetic cross-section.\n        *   For *high-energy* electrons, such as the 1000 keV (1 MeV) electrons in this TEM, the situation is reversed. The electron is moving at nearly the speed of light. It passes by the gas molecules so quickly that the probability of an interaction (scattering event) is very low. Consequently, the scattering cross-section, σ_eg, for high-energy electrons is *much smaller* than the gas-kinetic cross-section, σ_gg. For 1 MeV electrons, σ_eg is typically on the order of 10⁻¹⁸ to 10⁻²⁰ cm², which is orders of magnitude smaller than σ_gg.\n\n4.  **Analyze the relationship between λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have established that for this high-energy scenario: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n    *   Let's look at the denominators of the MFP equations:\n        *   Denominator of λ1: √2 * n * σ_gg\n        *   Denominator of λ2: n * σ_eg\n    *   Since σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg (by several orders of magnitude), the denominator for λ1 is significantly larger than the denominator for λ2.\n    *   The mean free path is *inversely* proportional to its denominator. A larger denominator results in a smaller MFP.\n    *   Therefore, since the denominator for λ1 is much larger than for λ2, the resulting MFP λ1 must be much smaller than λ2.\n    *   Conclusion: **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation -> Incorrect. The underlying physics is different.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> This states that λ2 is larger than λ1, which is correct. However, it puts a very small upper bound on the ratio (λ2/λ1 < 1.22). Our analysis showed that λ2 is *much* larger than λ1, so this option is incorrect.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> This states that λ2 is larger than λ1 by a factor of at least 1.22. Since our physical analysis showed that λ2 is orders of magnitude larger than λ1 (i.e., λ2 >> λ1), it is certainly greater than 1.22*λ1. This statement is consistent with our conclusion.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1 -> Incorrect. This would only be true if σ_eg were significantly larger than σ_gg, which happens for low-energy electrons, not the 1000 keV electrons in a TEM.\n\nThe physical reality is that the mean free path for the high-energy electrons in the residual gas is extremely long (hundreds or thousands of kilometers), which is precisely why the electron beam can travel through the microscope column without significant unwanted scattering. The mean free path of the gas molecules colliding with each other is also long due to the vacuum, but significantly shorter than that of the electrons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
