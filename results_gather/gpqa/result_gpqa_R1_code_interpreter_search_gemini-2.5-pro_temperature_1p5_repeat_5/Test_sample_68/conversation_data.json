    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum resolution of a detector needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a moving particle $X^0$. This involves concepts from special relativity, specifically time dilation and the relativistic velocity of the particle, combined with the principles of radioactive decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\" needed to \"observe at least 30% of the decays\". In particle physics detectors like a bubble chamber, a decay is \"observed\" if the parent particle leaves a track of a certain minimum length before it decays. If the particle decays too close to its creation point, its track is too short to be resolved, and the decay is effectively \"unobserved\". Let this minimum resolvable length be $d_{res}$. Therefore, an observed decay corresponds to a particle that travels a distance $x > d_{res}$ before decaying. We want the fraction of such observed decays to be at least 30% of the total number of particles.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Decay Probability:** The decay of particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a single particle survives for a time 't' in the laboratory frame is given by $P(T > t) = e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}}$, where $\\tau_{lab}$ is the average lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\n3.  **Relate Time and Distance:** The distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame is $x = v \\cdot t$, where 'v' is the particle's velocity. We can express the probability of survival in terms of distance traveled: $P(X > x) = e^{-x/(v \\cdot \\tau_{lab})}$. This is the probability that the particle travels a distance greater than 'x' before decaying.\n\n4.  **Set Up the Condition:** We require that the probability of observing the decay (i.e., the particle traveling a distance greater than the resolution $d_{res}$) is at least 0.30.\n    $P(X > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d_{res}/(v \\cdot \\tau_{lab})} \\ge 0.30$\n    To find the minimum resolution, we consider the equality limit:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/(v \\cdot \\tau_{lab})} = 0.30$\n\n5.  **Solve for Resolution ($d_{res}$):**\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-d_{res} / (v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}) = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n6.  **Calculate Relativistic Quantities:**\n    *   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** This is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. Given as $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor relates measurements between the rest frame and the lab frame. It's calculated from the total energy (E) and the rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n        Given $E = 27$ GeV and $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.9179$\n    *   **Lab Frame Lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$):** This is the dilated lifetime observed in the lab.\n        $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n    *   **Velocity (v):** The particle's velocity in the lab frame is related to its Lorentz factor.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} \\implies v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n        A more direct way to express the term $v \\cdot \\gamma$ is useful here. From the energy-momentum relation, we have $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2$. Also, $p=\\gamma m_0 v$ and $E=\\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n        $(\\gamma m_0 v c)^2 = (\\gamma m_0 c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2$\n        $\\gamma^2 v^2 = \\gamma^2 c^2 - c^2 = c^2(\\gamma^2 - 1)$\n        $v\\gamma = c\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n        This provides a convenient expression for the product $v \\cdot \\gamma$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the expressions for $v$ and $\\tau_{lab}$ into the equation for $d_{res}$.\n    $d_{res} = -v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -(v\\gamma) \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = - (c\\sqrt{\\gamma^2-1}) \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n    Now, we plug in the numerical values.\n    *   $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $\\gamma = 27 / 3.41 \\approx 7.9179$\n    *   $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{(7.9179)^2 - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{62.693 - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{61.693} \\approx 7.8545$\n    *   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n\n    $d_{res} \\approx - (2.9979 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (7.8545) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx (2.3547 \\times 10^9) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16}) \\cdot (1.204)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx (1.8837 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nTo perform the calculation with high precision, we use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants and given values\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = 299792458\n# Proper lifetime of X^0 in seconds\ntau0 = 8e-16\n# Energy of X^0 in GeV\nE = 27\n# Rest mass of X^0 in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# Calculate the term sqrt(gamma^2 - 1) which relates to momentum\ngamma_factor = np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Calculate the natural log term from the decay probability condition P > 0.3\nlog_term = -np.log(0.30)\n\n# Calculate the minimum resolution distance (d_res) using the derived formula:\n# d_res = -c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2-1) * ln(0.30)\n# which is equivalent to: d_res = c * tau0 * gamma_factor * log_term\nd_res = c * tau0 * gamma_factor * log_term\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{d_res:.2e}\")\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n2.27e-06\n```\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

The small discrepancy (approximately 9%) between our calculated value and the option's value might be due to slightly different constants or rounding in the problem's intended solution.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   A particle $X^0$ with rest mass $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/cÂ² and proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s is created in a bubble chamber.\n    *   The particle has a total energy of $E = 27$ GeV in the laboratory frame.\n    *   It decays via $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$.\n    *   We need to find the minimum resolution, let's call it $d_{res}$, of the detector required to \"observe\" at least 30% of these decay events.\n\n2.  **Interpret \"Observing a Decay\":**\n    In a detector like a bubble chamber, a particle leaves a visible track. A decay is considered \"observed\" if the parent particle ($X^0$) travels a distance greater than the detector's minimum spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) before it decays. If the decay happens at a distance less than $d_{res}$ from its creation point, the track is too short to be resolved, and the decay is essentially \"unobserved\".\n\n3.  **Apply the Law of Radioactive Decay:**\n    The decay of unstable particles is a probabilistic process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a single particle survives for a time 't' in a given reference frame is $P(T > t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the mean lifetime in that frame.\n    *   In the particle's rest frame, the mean lifetime is the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$.\n    *   In the laboratory frame, due to time dilation, the mean lifetime is longer: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Relate Time and Distance in the Lab Frame:**\n    A particle moving at velocity $v$ travels a distance $x = v \\cdot t$ in time $t$. We can express the survival probability as a function of the distance traveled, $x$:\n    $P(X > x) = e^{-x/(v \\cdot \\tau_{lab})}$.\n    The term $v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$ is the average distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame, also known as the mean decay length, $\\lambda_{lab}$.\n    So, $P(X > x) = e^{-x/\\lambda_{lab}}$.\n\n5.  **Set Up the Condition:**\n    The condition \"observe at least 30% of the decays\" means that the probability of the particle traveling a distance greater than the resolution $d_{res}$ must be at least 0.30.\n    $P(X > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda_{lab}} \\ge 0.30$\n    To find the *minimum* resolution, we consider the equality:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda_{lab}} = 0.30$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Resolution, $d_{res}$:**\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $\\frac{-d_{res}}{\\lambda_{lab}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda_{lab} \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda_{lab} \\cdot \\ln(1/0.30)$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Relativistic Quantities:**\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor relates energy and mass by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n    *   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda_{lab}$):** $\\lambda_{lab} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0)$. We can express the product $v\\gamma$ in a more convenient form.\n        We know that $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. Squaring and rearranging gives $(\\gamma v/c)^2 = \\gamma^2 - 1$, so $v\\gamma = c\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n        Therefore, $\\lambda_{lab} = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the expression for $\\lambda_{lab}$ into the equation for $d_{res}$:\n    $d_{res} = - (c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n    Now, we can plug in the numbers. It is best to use a script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants and given values\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\ntau0 = 8e-16   # Proper lifetime in seconds\nE = 27.0       # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41    # Rest mass energy in GeV\n\n# 1.

The order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is identical, and the numerical value is the closest among the choices. The minor discrepancy (around 9%) is likely due to small rounding or slight inconsistencies in the values provided in the problem statement versus the intended answer. In a multiple-choice setting, this is the clear choice.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires us to find the minimum track length, or resolution, that a detector must be able to measure to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n### Physics Principles\n1.  **Special Relativity**: A particle moving at relativistic speeds experiences time dilation. Its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor).\n    *   $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n2.  **Radioactive Decay Law**: The probability of a particle surviving for a time $t$ in the lab frame follows an exponential distribution: $P(\\text{survival time} > t) = e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}}$.\n3.  **Relating Time and Distance**: The distance $x$ a particle travels in the lab frame in time $t$ is $x = vt$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n\n### Derivation\n1.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy ($E$) to the rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n2.  **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda_{lab}$)**: This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.\n    $\\lambda_{lab} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n    We can express the velocity-gamma product, $v\\gamma$, using the relativistic identity $(\\gamma v/c)^2 = \\gamma^2 - 1$.
