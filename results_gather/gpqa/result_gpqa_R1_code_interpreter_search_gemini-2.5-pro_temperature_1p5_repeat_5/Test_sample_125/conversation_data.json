    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure. The main chain is a hexane with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. The numbering starts from the end closer to the ketone.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is given as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H‚Åª) can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces (re or si face).\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (its configuration is still S).\n    *   The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between products:** These two products have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other are called **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric alcohol products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry through the central CH2 group).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The use of \"excess\" ensures both are reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship between products:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3), making it an achiral molecule. This is a **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same molecule, just flipped over.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of **five** different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will elute as a separate, single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The compounds from Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the compounds from Reaction II (C5 diols). Their polarities will be different, so there will be no accidental overlap between the peaks from the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for the meso from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, a chiral column can separate both **diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n*   Since a chiral column can resolve all of them, each compound will produce a separate peak (assuming the column is effective and there's no accidental co-elution, which is the standard assumption for such problems).\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** We count the number of unique stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   This gives a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
