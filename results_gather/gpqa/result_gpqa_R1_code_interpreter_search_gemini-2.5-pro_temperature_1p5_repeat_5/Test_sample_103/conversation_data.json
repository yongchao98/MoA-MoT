    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $T_2 / T_1$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   Star masses are equal: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   Planet masses are similar: $M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$.\n    *   Orbits are circular.\n    *   The detection method is the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n    *   The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines.\n    *   The amplitude of the wavelength shift for star 1 (due to planet #1) is $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms.\n    *   The amplitude of the wavelength shift for star 2 (due to planet #2) is $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms.\n\n3.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_{rad}$. Specifically, the amplitude of the shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is proportional to the amplitude of the radial velocity, $K$ (also known as the semi-amplitude).\n    *   This relationship is given by the Doppler effect formula: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{K}{c}$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_0$ and $c$ are constants, we have $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n4.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:**\n    *   The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n        $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{(M_{star} + M_p)^{2/3}}$\n    *   Here, $T$ is the orbital period, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $M_p$ is the planet's mass, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Relationship using the Problem's Conditions:**\n    *   The problem states that $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$ and $M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$.\n    *   The term \"detected\" implies that the inclination $i$ is not zero. Since there is no other information, we can assume that the statistical viewing angle, $\\sin i$, is comparable for both systems.\n    *   Given these conditions, most terms in the formula for $K$ can be treated as a single constant, $C$, for both systems:\n        $C = (2\\pi G)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{(M_{star} + M_p)^{2/3}}$\n    *   This simplifies the relationship between $K$ and $T$ to:\n        $K = C \\cdot T^{-1/3}$ or $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Ratio of Periods:**\n    *   We can write the relationship for both planets:\n        $K_1 \\propto T_1^{-1/3}$\n        $K_2 \\propto T_2^{-1/3}$\n    *   Now, let's take the ratio:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n7.  **Solve for the Desired Ratio ($T_2/T_1$):**\n    *   We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n    *   Substitute this into the equation:\n        $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   To solve for the ratio of periods, first, cube both sides of the equation:\n        $\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    *   The question asks for \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which corresponds to the ratio $T_2/T_1$. So, we need to invert the expression:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 \\right)^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   Now, compute the numerical value of the ratio.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio (5/7)^3\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.364.

    "The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Radial Velocity and Wavelength Shift:** The radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. This wobble causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The amplitude of the star's velocity ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) observed. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    $K_2 / K_1 = \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude ($K$) is related to the orbital period ($T$) and other system parameters by the formula:\n    $K = (\\frac{2\\pi G}{T})^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$ (assuming $M_{star} \\gg M_p$)\n    Since the stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$), and assuming a similar orbital inclination ($i$) for both detected planets, we can see that the velocity amplitude $K$ is proportional to $T^{-1/3}$.\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Solving for T2/T1:** We substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    $1.4 = (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^{1/3}$\n    To find the period ratio, we first cube both sides:\n    $(1.4)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    $2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($T_2/T_1$). Therefore, we take the reciprocal:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.364$\n\nThis result is equivalent to the calculation $(5/7)^3$, which yielded approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>"
