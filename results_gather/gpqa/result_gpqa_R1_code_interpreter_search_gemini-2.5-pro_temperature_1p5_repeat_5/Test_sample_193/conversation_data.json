    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), where each spin can take values +1 or -1.

    "The problem is to find the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3, each taking values +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function is Z = Σ e^(-βE), where the sum is over all possible states of the system and β = 1/(kT).\n\nFirst, we need to enumerate all possible states and calculate the energy for each state. There are 2^3 = 8 possible states since each of the three spins can take two values. A state is represented by the triplet (S1, S2, S3).\n\nLet's calculate the term K = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.

The degeneracy of this energy level is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each state. Since we have grouped the states by energy levels, we can write Z as:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\ng₁ = 2, E₁ = -3J\ng₂ = 6, E₂ = J\n\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\nB) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\nD) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
