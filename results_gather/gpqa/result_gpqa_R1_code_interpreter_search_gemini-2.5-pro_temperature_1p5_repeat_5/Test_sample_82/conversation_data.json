    "This problem requires a two-part calculation for a weak acid-strong base titration.\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% titration**\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation:** First, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH): `moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.05 M * 0.0200 L = 0.00100 mol`.\n    *   The new volume after adding water is `20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3 = 0.0400 L`.\n    *   The concentration of the diluted acetic acid is `M_diluted = moles / new volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M`.\n\n2.  **Titration Reaction:** The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH -> CH3COONa + H2O.\n\n3.  **Buffer Region:** \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-). At this point, 75% of the original acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n4.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the buffer:\n    `pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])`\n    where `[A-]` is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and `[HA]` is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\n5.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.733`\n\n6.  **Calculate pH:** Since the concentrations are in the same volume, the ratio `[A-]/[HA]` is the same as the ratio of their moles.\n    *   Ratio = (moles of A-) / (moles of HA) = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n    *   `pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256`\n\n**Part 2: pH at the equivalence point**\n\n1.  **Equivalence Point Conditions:** At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming 0.00100 mol of the conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-).\n\n2.  **Volume at Equivalence Point:** We need to find the volume of NaOH added.\n    *   `Volume of NaOH = moles / Molarity = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm3`.\n    *   Total volume of the solution = (initial diluted acid volume) + (volume of NaOH added) = `40.00 cm3 + 10.00 cm3 = 50.00 cm3 = 0.0500 L`.\n\n3.  **Concentration of Acetate:**\n    *   `[CH3COO-] = moles / total volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M`.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolyze):\n    `CH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-`\n\n5.  **Calculate Kb:** We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   `Kw = Ka * Kb`\n    *   `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.405 x 10^-10`.\n\n6.  **Calculate [OH-] concentration:** We set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction, where `x` represents the change in concentration.\n    *   `Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-] = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)`\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate `(0.020 - x)` as `0.020`.\n    *   `5.405 x 10^-10 = x^2 / 0.020`\n    *   `x^2 = (5.405 x 10^-10) * 0.020 = 1.081 x 10^-11`\n    *   `x = [OH-] = √(1.081 x 10^-11) ≈ 3.288 x 10^-6 M`.\n\n7.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   `pOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.288 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.483`\n    *   `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517`\n\nBased on the calculations, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Part 1: pH at 25% titration\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# The ratio of concentrations [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Part 2: pH at the equivalence point\n# Initial moles of acetic acid\nmoles_acid = 0.05 * 0.0200 # 0.001 mol\n# Total volume at equivalence point\n# Initial volume of diluted acid = 20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3 = 0.040 L\n# Volume of NaOH needed = moles_acid / C_NaOH = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.010 L\ntotal_volume_equiv = 0.040 + 0.010 # 0.050 L\n# Concentration of acetate at equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_volume_equiv # 0.02 M\n\n# Hydrolysis of acetate: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# Kb = Kw / Ka\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_equiv = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_equiv:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the pH at two different points during the titration of diluted acetic acid with NaOH.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of pH at 25% titration**\n\n1.  **Initial State & Dilution:**\n    *   We start with 20.00 cm³ (0.0200 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.00100 mol.\n    *   This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   The new volume of the acid solution is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (0.0400 L).\n    *   The concentration of the diluted acetic acid is Moles / New Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **At 25% Titration:**\n    *   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   This leaves 75% of the acetic acid unreacted.\n    *   At this stage, the solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n3.  **Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    *   The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n        where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n    *   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   The ratio of concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n    *   Now, we calculate the pH:\n        pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 4.26.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Equivalence Point Conditions:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the initial 0.00100 mol of CH₃COOH has reacted completely with NaOH to form 0.00100 mol of the conjugate base, sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO).\n    *   The solution now contains only the weak base, acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n2.  **Volume and Concentration at Equivalence Point:**\n    *   We need to find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to neutralize 0.00100 mol of acid:\n        Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L (10.00 cm³).\n    *   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is the initial diluted acid volume plus the added NaOH volume:\n        Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ (0.0500 L).\n    *   The concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) at this point is:\n        [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M.\n\n3.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate Ion:**\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolyze) to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n        CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C) and the Ka of acetic acid:\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n4.  **Calculating pOH and pH:**\n    *   We can find the concentration of OH⁻ using the Kb expression:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n        5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.020, so (0.020 - x) ≈ 0.020.\n        x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Now, calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n        pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n        pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 8.52.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
