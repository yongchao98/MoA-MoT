    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis, where the total orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are specified. The state is $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers (p-orbital), $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m=-1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum's z-component.\n    *   The measurement performed is of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The desired outcome corresponds to a specific state in the uncoupled basis, $|l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{z}$ is given by $m_z \\hbar$. The problem states that the measured eigenvalue for both electrons is $-\\hbar$. This means the final measured state corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The full state is $|l_1=1, m_1=-1\\rangle |l_2=1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Relate the Coupled and Uncoupled Bases:**\n    *   Any state in the coupled basis $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear superposition of states in the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$. This expansion is governed by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   The general form of the expansion is:\n        $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |m_1, m_2\\rangle$\n        (where we have suppressed the fixed $l_1=1, l_2=1$ notation for clarity).\n\n3.  **Apply the Selection Rule for Angular Momentum Addition:**\n    *   A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. For a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ to be non-zero, it is necessary that the magnetic quantum numbers add up:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = m$\n    *   In this problem, the initial state has a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired final state has individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the selection rule is satisfied:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We compare this sum to the total $m$ of the system: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   The probability of measuring the system in the state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding coefficient in the expansion.\n    *   This coefficient is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $C = \\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$.\n    *   Since the selection rule $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is not satisfied, this coefficient must be zero. $C = 0$.\n    *   The probability is therefore $P = |C|^2 = 0^2 = 0$.\n\n5.  **Verification with Python (Optional but helpful):**\n    We can use a scientific library like `sympy` to compute the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and verify the result.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the quantum numbers from the problem\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# The measured outcome corresponds to m1 and m2\nm1 = -1\nm2 = -1\n\n# The probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n# |<l1,m1; l2,m2 | l,m>|^2\n# The coefficient is <1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1>\ncoefficient = CG(l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the coefficient's magnitude.\n# Since the coefficient is real, this is just the square.\nprobability = sympy.Abs(coefficient)**2\n\nprint(probability)\n```\nThe python code confirms that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is 0, and therefore the probability is 0.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe state of the system has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m=-1$. The measurement asks for the probability of finding the individual z-components to be $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$. The sum of these components is $m_1+m_2 = -2$. Due to the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is impossible for a system with total $m=-1$ to be found in a state where the components sum to -2. Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is exactly zero.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The initial state of the 2-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for its projection along the z-axis is $m=-1$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, is therefore $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\nWe want to find the probability of measuring the z-components of the individual electrons' angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, and getting the eigenvalues $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to a final state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nA fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. That is, the operator relationship is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, and the relationship between their quantum numbers is $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\nFor any measurement to be possible, the sum of the measured individual quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$) must be equal to the total quantum number ($m$) of the system's state before the measurement.\n\nIn this problem:\n*   The system's total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   The desired measurement outcome corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nLet's check if the conservation rule is satisfied:\nSum of the individual components = $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nWe see that the sum of the desired individual z-components ($-2$) is not equal to the total z-component of the system's state ($-1$).\n$-2 \\neq -1$.\n\nBecause the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved, it is impossible for a system in a state with total $m=-1$ to be found in a configuration where the components sum to $m_1+m_2=-2$. Therefore, the probability of such an outcome is zero.\n\nThe probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle l_1,m_1; l_2,m_2 | l,m \\rangle|^2$. The coefficient $\\langle 1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1 \\rangle$ is zero because the condition $m_1+m_2=m$ is not met.\n\n<<<A>>>"
