    "Here is the reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **7.0 ppm:** 1H, doublet (d), J = 16.0 Hz\n*   **5.5 ppm:** 1H, doublet of quartets (dq)\n*   **2.1 ppm:** 3H, singlet (s)\n*   **1.6 ppm:** 3H, doublet (d)\n\nThe possible compounds are:\n*   Cis-propenyl acetate\n*   Trans-propenyl acetate\n*   Cis-butenyl acetate\n*   Trans-butenyl acetate\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is consistent with a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means these protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to the carbonyl of an ester or acetate group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group. This signal is consistent with all options.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton (Propenyl vs. Butenyl):**\n    *   Let's sum the number of protons from the integration values: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = **8 protons** in total.\n    *   Now, let's count the protons in the possible structures:\n        *   **Propenyl acetate (CH₃-CH=CH-O-COCH₃):**\n            *   CH₃ (propenyl part) = 3H\n            *   CH=CH (vinyl part) = 2H\n            *   CH₃ (acetyl part) = 3H\n            *   Total = 3 + 2 + 3 = **8 protons**. This matches the NMR data.\n        *   **Butenyl acetate (e.g., But-2-enyl acetate: CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-COCH₃):**\n            *   CH₃ (butenyl part) = 3H\n            *   CH=CH (vinyl part) = 2H\n            *   CH₂ (methylene part) = 2H\n            *   CH₃ (acetyl part) = 3H\n            *   Total = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = **10 protons**. This does not match the NMR data.\n    *   Since the total proton count is 8, we can confidently eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**. The unknown compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Remaining Signals for Propenyl Acetate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-COCH₃.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group, CH₃(a). It is a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinyl proton, H(b).\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton H(b). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton H(c) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group CH₃(a). Thus, it appears as a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton H(c). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b). The higher chemical shift (downfield) is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n\n4.  **Distinguish between Cis and Trans Isomers:**\n    *   The stereochemistry of the double bond is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons, H(b) and H(c).\n    *   The general rule for vinyl proton coupling is:\n        *   **³J_trans (trans-coupling):** Typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **³J_cis (cis-coupling):** Typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The data for the signal at 7.0 ppm shows it is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   This large J-value falls squarely in the range for *trans*-coupling. Therefore, the protons H(b) and H(c) are in a trans configuration relative to each other.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The proton count (8H) indicates a **propenyl acetate**.\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons indicates a **trans** configuration.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
