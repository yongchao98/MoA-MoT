    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the energies for the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by its set of quantum numbers.\n*   **Quantum Numbers:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the quantum state is defined by two numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the `n`-th state of a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\n    The problem provides a unit of energy E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2). So, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n*   **State Capacity:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   The lowest energy level is `n=1`. We place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1² * E) = 2E.\n*   The next lowest energy level is `n=2`. We place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2² * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    E_ground = (Energy from n=1) + (Energy from n=2) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n    *Ground State Configuration: (n=1)²(n=2)²*\n\n**3. Calculation of the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited)**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level. This corresponds to the smallest possible increase in total energy.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2`, and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n*   The new configuration is:\n    *   Two particles in `n=1`. Energy = 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n    *   One particle in `n=2`. Energy = 1 * E₂ = 1 * (2² * E) = 4E.\n    *   One particle in `n=3`. Energy = 1 * E₃ = 1 * (3² * E) = 9E.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    E_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n    *First Excited State Configuration: (n=1)²(n=2)¹(n=3)¹*\n\n**4. Calculation of the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited)**\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest possible energy above the first excited state. We must consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n\nLet's consider other possible low-energy excited configurations:\n\n*   **Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: (n=1)¹(n=2)²(n=3)¹\n    *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: (n=1)²(n=3)²\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1²E) + (2 * 3²E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n\n*   **Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: (n=1)²(n=2)¹(n=4)¹\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** **18E**.\n\n    *Second Excited State Configuration: (n=1)¹(n=2)²(n=3)¹*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
