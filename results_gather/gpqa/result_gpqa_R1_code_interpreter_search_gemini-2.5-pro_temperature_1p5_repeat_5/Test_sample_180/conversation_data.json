    "This problem requires us to understand the solar neutrino spectrum and how it changes under a hypothetical scenario. Let's break down the reasoning process step by step.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State and the Hypothetical Change\n\n*   **Solar Neutrinos:** The Sun produces neutrinos primarily through the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III), and to a lesser extent, the CNO cycle. Each reaction produces neutrinos with a characteristic energy spectrum (either a continuous spectrum or a sharp energy line).\n*   **The Change:** The problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. This happened about 8.5 minutes ago.\n*   **Time Delay:** Neutrinos travel from the Sun to the Earth at nearly the speed of light. The travel time is about 8 minutes and 20 seconds. Therefore, if a reaction in the Sun's core stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we are observing the effects of that shutdown on Earth *right now*.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands, Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV), *after* the pp-III branch has stopped.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Relevant Neutrino Sources\n\nLet's identify the neutrino sources from the various solar reactions and their energies:\n\n*   **pp-I Branch:**\n    *   `p + p → d + e⁺ + νe` (pp neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to 420 keV. **Does not contribute to either band.**\n*   **pp-II Branch:** (This branch remains active)\n    *   `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe` (Beryllium-7 neutrinos): Produces a very intense, sharp energy line at **861 keV**. This falls squarely in **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n*   **pp-III Branch:** (This branch is turned OFF)\n    *   `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe` (Boron-8 neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. In the *standard* solar model, these neutrinos would contribute to both bands. However, in our hypothetical scenario, **their flux is now zero.**\n*   **CNO Cycle:** (These reactions remain active)\n    *   Neutrinos from ¹³N decay (up to 1.2 MeV) and ¹⁵O decay (up to 1.73 MeV) have continuous spectra. They **contribute to both Band 1 and Band 2.**\n\n### 3. Calculating the Fluxes in Each Band (Post-Change)\n\nNow let's calculate the flux in each band under the new condition (no pp-III branch).\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800 keV - 900 keV):**\n    *   The primary contributor to this band is the **⁷Be neutrino line at 861 keV**. This is a very strong source of neutrinos.\n    *   There is also a small background contribution from the continuous spectrum of CNO neutrinos.\n    *   However, the ⁷Be line flux is overwhelmingly dominant. For an approximate calculation, we can say:\n        *   Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux(⁷Be line)\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700 keV - 800 keV):**\n    *   There are no strong neutrino lines in this energy range.\n    *   The ⁸B neutrinos, which would normally contribute here, are gone.\n    *   The only remaining contributors are neutrinos from the **CNO cycle**.\n        *   Flux(Band 1) = Flux(CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range)\n\n### 4. Estimating the Ratio using Order of Magnitude Fluxes\n\nTo find the ratio, we need the approximate values for these fluxes. We can use standard values for the total integrated fluxes from different solar reactions.\n\n*   Total flux of ⁷Be neutrinos (at 861 keV): **Φ(⁷Be) ≈ 5 × 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**. This entire flux is in Band 2.\n    *   So, **Flux(Band 2) ≈ 5 × 10⁹**.\n*   Total flux of CNO neutrinos (from ¹³N and ¹⁵O combined): **Φ(CNO) ≈ 5 × 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**. This total flux is spread across an energy range of about 1.7 MeV.\n    *   We need to estimate the fraction of this total CNO flux that falls within our 100 keV wide Band 1 (700-800 keV). The combined CNO spectrum is somewhat peaked, and this band is near the peak region. A reasonable order-of-magnitude estimate is that about 10% of the total CNO flux falls in this interesting central region.\n    *   Flux(Band 1) ≈ 10% of Φ(CNO) = 0.1 × (5 × 10⁸) = **5 × 10⁷**.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nNow we can compute the final ratio:\n\nFlux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) ≈ (5 × 10⁷) / (5 × 10⁹)\n\nRatio ≈ 10⁻² = **0.01**\n\nThis matches option A. The logic is robust: Band 2 is dominated by the huge, unaffected ⁷Be line flux, while Band 1 is populated only by a small fraction of the much smaller total CNO flux. The ratio of these two quantities is on the order of 10⁻².\n\n<<<A>>>"
