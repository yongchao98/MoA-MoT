    "The user is asking to identify an immunological process based on a described experiment.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n    *   **Observation:** The antigen reaches Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine. This is where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n    *   **Cell population of interest:** Proliferating cells isolated from the Peyer's patches. Proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response following antigen recognition.\n    *   **Key finding:** Sequencing of the *variable heavy chain gene* from these proliferating cells shows *high variability*.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options based on the key finding:**\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., from IgM to IgA). It affects the effector function of the antibody but does not alter the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding. Therefore, this does not explain the high variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations at a high rate into the DNA sequences of the *variable* regions of immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates variants of the original antibody, and those with higher affinity for the antigen are selected for survival. This process directly leads to \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a proliferating B cell population after antigen exposure. This matches the observation perfectly.\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system (and can be linked to the adaptive system) involving a cascade of proteins. It does not involve any genetic changes to B cells or their immunoglobulin genes.\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that initially creates a diverse repertoire of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. While it generates the initial diversity, the process described in the question is happening in *proliferating cells* *after* antigen exposure in a secondary lymphoid organ, leading to further, focused diversification. SHM is the process that refines the antigen response after initial activation, not V(D)J recombination.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in a secondary lymphoid organ after antigen exposure is the classic definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
