    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) has a methyl group (-CH₃), which is an electron-donating group and an *ortho-, para-* director for electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields a mixture of *ortho*-nitrotoluene and *para*-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product. In multi-step synthesis problems, we typically follow the pathway of the major product.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** *para*-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n    ```\n        CH₃\n         |\n      /¯¯¯\\\n     |  ◉  |\n      \\___/\n         |\n        NO₂\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction. Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) is an oxidizing agent that can selectively oxidize activated methyl groups, such as a methyl group on an aromatic ring (a benzylic position), to an aldehyde. While stronger oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would oxidize it all the way to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂/H₂SO₄ is commonly used to stop at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Reactant:** *para*-nitrotoluene (Product 1).\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group is oxidized to a formyl group (-CHO).\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** *para*-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n    ```\n        CHO\n         |\n      /¯¯¯\\\n     |  ◉  |\n      \\___/\n         |\n        NO₂\n    ```\n*(Note: If product 2 were the carboxylic acid, p-nitrobenzoic acid, its subsequent reaction with acetone and NaOH is not a standard, straightforward transformation. The aldehyde route leads to a very common named reaction, making it the most plausible intended pathway.)*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed condensation reaction between an aldehyde and a ketone, known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation** (a variation of the aldol condensation).\n*   **Reactants:** *para*-nitrobenzaldehyde (Product 2) and acetone (CH₃COCH₃).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The strong base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃).\n    2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of *para*-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is protonated to form an aldol addition product, which then readily dehydrates (loses a water molecule) to form a stable α,β-unsaturated ketone. This dehydration is favorable as it creates a large, conjugated system.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The *trans* (E) isomer is the major product as it is thermodynamically more stable.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:**\n\n    ```\n                      H   H\n                       \\ /\n      O₂N - (benzene ring) - C===C - C(=O) - CH₃\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n\nNow, we need to identify the symmetry elements present in the final product, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n    *   **Planarity:** The molecule has an extensive conjugated π-system involving the nitro group, the benzene ring, the carbon-carbon double bond, and the carbonyl group. This forces the entire backbone of the molecule (O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C=O) to be planar to maximize orbital overlap.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** This molecular plane, which contains all the heavy atoms (O, N, C) and the two hydrogens on the double bond, acts as a plane of symmetry. The methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to this plane. In its lowest energy conformation, one of the methyl C-H bonds will lie in this plane, and the other two hydrogens will be positioned symmetrically above and below the plane. Thus, the entire molecule possesses this single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion. Inverting through the center of the benzene ring would map the nitro group onto the butenone group, which are different.\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** The molecule does not possess any C₂ or higher-order rotation axes. The two substituents on the benzene ring are different, so no C₂ axis can pass through or be perpendicular to the ring.\n    *   **Improper Rotation Axes (Sₙ):** Since there are no Cₙ axes (for n>1), there are no Sₙ axes (for n>1).\n\n*   **Conclusion on Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nThe given options are:\nA) D₂h\nB) C₃\nC) Cₛ\nD) C₂h\n\nOur analysis concludes that the molecule's point group is Cₛ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
