    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons (C1 and C6). The oxygen is atom '7'.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4 of the bicyclic system.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute stereochemistry at the four chiral centers.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. This reagent acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (effectively \"Me⁻\").\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Key Principles of the Reaction**\n\nThis reaction follows two important rules:\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (methyl group) attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2-like mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack), leading to **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked. The configuration of the other carbon of the epoxide is retained.\n\n**3. Apply the Principles to the Specific Reaction**\n\n*   **Step 3a: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n    *   The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached.\n    *   Carbon C6 has only a hydrogen atom attached (as it's not listed as having a substituent).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**, and the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n    *   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6 with inversion of configuration.\n    *   The configuration at C1, C3, and C4 are unaffected by the reaction and are retained.\n    *   The original stereochemistry of the starting material is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n    *   After the reaction:\n        *   The configuration at C1 remains **R**.\n        *   The configuration at C3 remains **R**.\n        *   The configuration at C4 remains **R**.\n        *   The configuration at C6 is inverted from **S** to **R**.\n\n*   **Step 3c: Determine the Structure and Name of the Product**\n    1.  **Identify the atoms and groups in the product:**\n        *   The epoxide ring opens. The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after an acidic workup (which is implicit).\n        *   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n        *   The substituents are:\n            *   At the original C1 position: An -OH group and a methyl group.\n            *   At the original C3 position: A methyl group.\n            *   At the original C4 position: A methyl group.\n            *   At the original C6 position: The new methyl group from the reagent.\n        *   In total, the product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n\n    2.  **Determine the IUPAC Numbering for the Product:**\n        *   According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (-OH) is assigned the lowest possible number, which is C1. Therefore, the original C1 of the epoxide becomes **C1 of the product**.\n        *   Next, we number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants. There are two ways to number from C1:\n            *   Path A (numbering towards the original C6): The methyl groups would be at positions 1, 2 (from original C6), 4 (from original C4), and 5 (from original C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n            *   Path B (numbering towards the original C2): The methyl groups would be at positions 1, 3 (from original C3), 4 (from original C4), and 6 (from original C6). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   Comparing the sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {1, 3, 4, 6} at the first point of difference, 2 is lower than 3. Thus, Path A is the correct numbering scheme.\n        *   The product is named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n    3.  **Assign the Absolute Configurations to the Product's Chiral Centers:**\n        *   We need to map the stereocenters from the starting material to the new product numbering.\n            *   Product **C1** corresponds to starting material **C1**. Its configuration is retained as **(1R)**.\n            *   Product **C2** corresponds to starting material **C6**. Its configuration is inverted from S to **R**, so it is **(2R)**.\n            *   Product **C4** corresponds to starting material **C4**. Its configuration is retained as **(4R)**.\n            *   Product **C5** corresponds to starting material **C3**. Its configuration is retained as **R**, so it is **(5R)**.\n        *   Putting it all together, the final product's absolute configuration is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe product of the reaction is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
