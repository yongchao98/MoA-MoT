    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the geometry of the aperture.**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. The problem states that N becomes infinitely large (N -> ∞). A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides converges to a circle. In this limit, the apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius 'R' of the resulting circle. So, we are dealing with a circular aperture of radius R = a.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the relevant physics principle.**\n    When monochromatic light passes through an aperture, it undergoes diffraction. Since the observation is in the far-field region, this is specifically Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima.\n\n*   **Step 3: Recall the formula for the minima of an Airy pattern.**\n    The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a' is given by:\n    I(θ) = I₀ * [ 2 * J₁(ka * sinθ) / (ka * sinθ) ]²\n    where:\n    *   θ is the angular distance from the central axis.\n    *   k is the wave number, k = 2π/λ.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n\n    The minima of the intensity pattern occur at the points where the numerator is zero, which means J₁(ka * sinθ) = 0. We need to find the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x). Let these zeros be denoted by x_m (where m = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n    The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n    ka * sin(θ_m) = x_m\n    (2πa/λ) * sin(θ_m) = x_m\n\n    The problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, sin(θ) ≈ θ.\n    (2πa/λ) * θ_m = x_m\n    θ_m = (λ / (2πa)) * x_m\n\n*   **Step 4: Find the angular positions of the first and second minima.**\n    We need the values for the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n    *   The first zero, x₁, corresponds to the first minimum.  x₁ ≈ 3.8317.\n    *   The second zero, x₂, corresponds to the second minimum. x₂ ≈ 7.0156.\n\n    Now, we can calculate the angular positions θ₁ and θ₂:\n    *   Angular position of the first minimum (m=1):\n        θ₁ = (λ / (2πa)) * x₁ ≈ (λ / (2πa)) * 3.8317\n    *   Angular position of the second minimum (m=2):\n        θ₂ = (λ / (2πa)) * x₂ ≈ (λ / (2πa)) * 7.0156\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima.**\n    The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(λ / (2πa)) * x₂] - [(λ / (2πa)) * x₁]\n    Δθ = (λ / (2πa)) * (x₂ - x₁)\n    Δθ ≈ (λ / (2πa)) * (7.0156 - 3.8317)\n    Δθ ≈ (λ / (2πa)) * (3.1839)\n\n    Now, we compute the numerical factor:\n    Factor = 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159) ≈ 0.5067\n    So, Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)\n\n*   **Step 6: Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated value is Δθ ≈ 0.507 λ/a.\n    The options are:\n    A) 0.500 λ / a\n    B) 0.610 λ / a\n    C) 0.506 λ / a\n    D) 1.220 λ /a\n\n    Our calculated value matches option C most closely. Note that option B, 0.610 λ/a, corresponds to the angular position of the first minimum itself (since 3.8317 / (2π) ≈ 0.610), not the distance between the first two minima.\n\nTo verify the calculation with higher precision:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# Find the first two zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, order 1 (J1)\n# jn_zeros(n, k) finds the first k positive zeros of Jn(x).\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nx1 = zeros[0]\nx2 = zeros[1]\n\n# The angular position of the m-th minimum is given by:\n# theta_m = (lambda / (2 * pi * a)) * x_m\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is:\n# delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1 = (lambda / a) * (x2 - x1) / (2 * pi)\nfactor = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f'{factor=}')\n```\n<execute_output>\nfactor=0.5067215324500989\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation confirms that the factor is approximately 0.5067.\n\nFinal Answer: The angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An N-sided polygon with an infinitely large number of sides (N -> ∞) approaches a circle.\nThe apothem 'a' of this polygon becomes the radius of the resulting circular aperture.\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture in the far-field region is known as an Airy pattern. The intensity minima of this pattern occur at specific angles.\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a' is given by:\n`sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m = (x_m * λ) / (2 * π * a)`\nwhere:\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `x_m` is the m-th zero of the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, `J₁(x)`.\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\nFirst, we need the values for the first two positive zeros of `J₁(x)`:\n*   The first zero, `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`. This corresponds to the first minimum.\n*   The second zero, `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`. This corresponds to the second minimum.\n\nNow, we can write the expressions for `θ₁` and `θ₂`:\n*   `θ₁ = (x₁ * λ) / (2 * π * a) ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2 * π * a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (x₂ * λ) / (2 * π * a) ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2 * π * a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them is:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(x₂ - x₁) * λ] / (2 * π * a)`\n`Δθ = [(7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ] / (2 * π * a)`\n`Δθ = (3.1839 * λ) / (2 * π * a)`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical coefficient:\n`Coefficient = 3.1839 / (2 * π) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067`\n\nThe python code executed previously gave a more precise value of `0.5067215`.\n\nSo, the angular distance is approximately `Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a\n\nThe calculated value `0.507 λ / a` is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
