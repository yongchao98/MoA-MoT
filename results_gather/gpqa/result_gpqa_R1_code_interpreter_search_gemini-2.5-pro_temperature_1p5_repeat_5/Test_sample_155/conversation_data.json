    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical about the double bond. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction proceeds in two steps:\n    1.  Treatment with one equivalent of mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid). This is a standard epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, a *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. A nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an S_N2-like fashion, which means it attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** A *syn*-addition (epoxidation) followed by an *anti*-addition (hydrolysis) results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-(E)-alkene produces a *meso*-compound (if the resulting molecule has the potential for a plane of symmetry, which octan-4,5-diol does).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, the achiral meso-compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. Like its E-isomer, it is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this case is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-(Z)-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore *cannot* be separated. They will elute from the column at the exact same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomeric pair of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   The result is a total of **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer.\n    *   As a result, a chiral column can separate enantiomers from each other. It can also, of course, separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   The chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   **Peak 3:** The (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   The result is a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC column and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC column. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
