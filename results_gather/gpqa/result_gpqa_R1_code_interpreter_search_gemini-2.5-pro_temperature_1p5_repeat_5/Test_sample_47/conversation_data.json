    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) to form product 1.**\nThis reaction is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst, a halogen replaces a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Cyclohexanone is a symmetric ketone, so all four α-hydrogens are equivalent. The reaction will result in the substitution of one of these hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1**: 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form product 2.**\nThis reaction is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. When an α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon is treated with a strong base, it undergoes a rearrangement.\n*   The base (OH⁻) abstracts the most acidic proton, which is on the α-carbon not bearing the halogen (C-6).\n*   This forms an enolate.\n*   The enolate then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n*   The strong base (NaOH) then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate.\n*   The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, leading to the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring to form a more stable carbanion. The C1-C6 bond breaks, which is typical as it leads to a contraction of the original six-membered ring into a five-membered ring.\n*   Upon protonation during workup, the final product is a carboxylic acid with a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine to form product 3.**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride reacts with the carboxylic acid, replacing the -OH group with a -Cl atom. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) to form product 4.**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4**: Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 (cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde).**\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those that cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation (like rotation or reflection) and are not in identical chemical environments. This corresponds to the number of signals one would expect to see in a ¹H NMR spectrum (ignoring splitting and accidental equivalence).\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring with a -CHO group attached to one of the carbons.\nLet's number the carbons of the ring: C1 is the carbon attached to the aldehyde group, followed by C2, C3, C4, and C5 around the ring.\n\nThe molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 carbon and its attached hydrogen, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. Due to rapid conformational flipping (pseudorotation) of the cyclopentane ring at room temperature, this symmetry is maintained on the NMR timescale.\n\nThis plane of symmetry makes certain atoms and their attached hydrogens equivalent:\n*   C2 is equivalent to C5.\n*   C3 is equivalent to C4.\n*   The hydrogens on C2 are equivalent to the corresponding hydrogens on C5.\n*   The hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the corresponding hydrogens on C4.\n\nNow, let's identify the unique sets of hydrogens:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO)**: This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 set)\n2.  **The proton on C1**: This hydrogen (on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group) lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 set)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5**: On C2, there are two hydrogens. Because C1 is a substituted carbon, these two hydrogens are diastereotopic (one is 'cis' to the aldehyde group, one is 'trans' relative to the ring's average plane). They are chemically non-equivalent. The same applies to C5. Due to the plane of symmetry, the 'cis' hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' hydrogen on C5, and the 'trans' hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' hydrogen on C5. This gives two distinct sets of hydrogens from these positions. (2 sets)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4**: Similarly, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic. The same applies to C4. The plane of symmetry makes the corresponding hydrogens on C3 and C4 equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 sets)\n\nLet's sum up the distinct sets:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Set 3: 'cis' H's on C2 & C5 (2H)\n*   Set 4: 'trans' H's on C2 & C5 (2H)\n*   Set 5: 'cis' H's on C3 & C4 (2H)\n*   Set 6: 'trans' H's on C3 & C4 (2H)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen sets = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
