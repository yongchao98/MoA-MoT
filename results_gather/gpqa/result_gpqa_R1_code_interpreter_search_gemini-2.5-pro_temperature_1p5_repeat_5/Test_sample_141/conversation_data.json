    "To determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space (also known as the Bloch sphere), we need to find its corresponding Bloch vector **r** = (rx, ry, rz).\n\n**1. Understand the Density Matrix**\n\nThe given density matrix is:\nρ = (1/2) * (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)\n\nIn the standard computational basis, the states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are represented by vectors:\n|0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ\n|1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ\n\nFrom these, we can construct the outer products |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|:\n|0⟩⟨0| = [[1],[0]] * [1, 0] = [[1, 0],[0, 0]]\n|1⟩⟨1| = [[0],[1]] * [0, 1] = [[0, 0],[0, 1]]\n\nNow, substitute these matrices back into the expression for ρ:\nρ = (1/2) * ([[1, 0],[0, 0]] + [[0, 0],[0, 1]])\nρ = (1/2) * [[1, 0],[0, 1]]\nρ = [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]\n\nThis matrix is (1/2) times the 2x2 identity matrix (I). This state is known as the maximally mixed state.\n\n**2. Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\n\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix (I) and the Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz) using the Bloch vector **r** = (rx, ry, rz):\nρ = (1/2) * (I + **r** ⋅ **σ**) = (1/2) * (I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz)\n\nThe Pauli matrices are:\nσx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nσy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nσz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\n**3. Calculate the Bloch Vector Components**\n\nThe components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using the formula:\nri = Tr(ρ * σi)\n\nLet's calculate each component:\n\n*   **rx = Tr(ρ * σx)**\n    ρ * σx = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[0, 1/2], [1/2, 0]]\n    Tr(ρ * σx) = 0 + 0 = 0\n    So, **rx = 0**.\n\n*   **ry = Tr(ρ * σy)**\n    ρ * σy = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [[0, -i/2], [i/2, 0]]\n    Tr(ρ * σy) = 0 + 0 = 0\n    So, **ry = 0**.\n\n*   **rz = Tr(ρ * σz)**\n    ρ * σz = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[1/2, 0], [0, -1/2]]\n    Tr(ρ * σz) = 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0\n    So, **rz = 0**.\n\nAlternatively, by direct comparison:\nWe have ρ = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]] which is (1/2)I.\nWe set this equal to the general form:\n(1/2)I = (1/2) * (I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz)\nI = I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz\n0 = rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz\nThis equation is only satisfied if rx = ry = rz = 0.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe Bloch vector is **r** = (rx, ry, rz) = (0, 0, 0).\nThis position corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) r=(0,0,0)\nB) r=(0,0,1)\nC) r=(1,1,1)\nD) r=(1,1,0)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
