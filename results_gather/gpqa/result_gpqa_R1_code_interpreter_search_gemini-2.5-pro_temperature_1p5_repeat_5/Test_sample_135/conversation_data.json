    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:**\n    We are asked to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n    *   The vector field is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is purely radial in spherical coordinates. This means the vector field can be written as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume of integration is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n    *   The integral to evaluate is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Tool: The Divergence Theorem**\n    The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) provides a powerful way to relate a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the vector field itself. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Where:\n    *   `V` is the volume (the sphere of radius R).\n    *   `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V` (the surface of the sphere of radius R).\n    *   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\n    This theorem is particularly useful here because the vector field `f` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where it is undefined. Calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly would involve the Dirac delta function (`∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`), which can be tricky. Using the surface integral bypasses this complication.\n\n3.  **Set up the Surface Integral**\n    We need to evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   **The Surface `S`**: This is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n    *   **The Vector Field `f` on the Surface**: We substitute `r=R` into the expression for `f`. So, on the surface `S`, `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **The Differential Surface Area Vector `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. The direction of this area element is normal to the surface, which is the radial direction `r_hat`. So, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**\n    Now we take the dot product of the vector field `f` on the surface and the differential surface area vector `dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1 (`r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`), the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. In spherical coordinates, this means integrating with respect to `θ` from `0` to `π` and with respect to `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    First, we evaluate the inner integral with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Now, we substitute this result into the outer integral with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} (2) dφ = [2φ]_0^{2π} = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of `f` is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n    The result `4π` is a constant and is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere. This is because the `1/r^2` decrease in the field's magnitude is perfectly offset by the `r^2` increase in the surface area of the sphere.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 0\nC) 4 π\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated answer is `4π`, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
