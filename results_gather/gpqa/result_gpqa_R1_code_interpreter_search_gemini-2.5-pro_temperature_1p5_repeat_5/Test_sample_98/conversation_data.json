    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four options are saturated molecules, so this information is consistent with all of them.\n    *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a single proton (`CH`) is coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n        *   One adjacent proton (gives a doublet, `d`).\n        *   Two adjacent protons (e.g., a `CH₂` group, gives a triplet, `t`).\n        *   Three adjacent protons (e.g., a `CH₃` group, gives a quartet, `q`).\n        *   Therefore, we are looking for a `CH` proton that is adjacent to a `CH`, a `CH₂`, and a `CH₃` group.\n    *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a single proton (`CH`) is coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons:\n        *   One adjacent proton (gives a doublet, `d`).\n        *   Two adjacent protons (e.g., a `CH₂` group, gives a triplet, `t`).\n        *   Another group of two adjacent protons (another `CH₂` group, gives another triplet, `t`).\n        *   Therefore, we are looking for a `CH` proton that is adjacent to a `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Structures of the Four Options\n\nThe condensed formulas can be confusing. Let's interpret them by assuming they represent a linear chain with branches in parentheses. We will then analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons in each structure.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n\n*   **Interpretation:** The most plausible interpretation that matches the atom count (C₉H₁₈O₂) is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n    ```\n                    (e)CH₂-CH₃\n                    |\n    (a)CH₃ - CH(b) - CH(c) - CH₂(d) - COOH\n                   |\n                   (f)CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Analysis of proton H(c):** This proton is on carbon C3. It is adjacent to:\n    *   H(b) on C4 (a `CH` group) -> creates a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   The two H(d) protons on C2 (a `CH₂` group) -> creates a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl group at C3 (group `f`, a `CH₂` group) -> creates another **triplet (t)**.\n    *   The splitting for H(c) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the given signals.\n*   **Analysis of proton H(b):** This proton is on carbon C4. It is adjacent to:\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (group `a`, a `CH₃` group) -> creates a **quartet (q)**.\n    *   H(c) on C3 (a `CH` group) -> creates a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl group at C4 (group `e`, a `CH₂` group) -> creates a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   The splitting for H(b) is a **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**. This corresponds to the same couplings as a `dtq` (coupling to 1H, 2H, and 3H). The naming order (`qdt` vs. `dtq`) depends on the relative magnitudes of the coupling constants (J values), which are not provided. This signal is a match for the `dtq`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A exhibits both required complex splitting patterns.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n\n*   **Interpretation:** 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n    ```\n               CH₃(e)\n               |\n    (a)CH₃ - CH(b) - CH(c) - CH₂(d) - COOH\n                    |\n                    CH₃(f)\n    ```\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Proton H(c) is adjacent to H(b) (`CH`), H(d) (`CH₂`), and H(f) (`CH₃`). Its splitting would be a `dtq`. This is a match.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to one `CH` and two `CH₂` groups. Therefore, there is no `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Does not match all data.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n\n*   **Interpretation:** 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid.\n    ```\n                 Et(d)   Et(e)\n                 |       |\n    (a)CH₃CH₂(b)-CH(c)-CH(f)-COOH\n    ```\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Proton H(c) is adjacent to H(b) (`CH₂`), H(f) (`CH`), and the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (d). Its splitting would be a `dtt`. This is a match.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to a `CH`, a `CH₂`, and a `CH₃` group. The other key methine proton, H(f), is only adjacent to H(c) (`CH`) and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (e), so it would be a `dt`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Does not match all data.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n\n*   **Interpretation:** 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n    ```\n                 CH₃(d)  CH₃(e)\n                 |       |\n    (a)CH₃CH₂(b)-CH(c)-CH(f)-COOH\n    ```\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Proton H(c) is adjacent to H(b) (`CH₂`), H(f) (`CH`), and H(d) (`CH₃`). Its splitting would be a `tqd` (equivalent to a `dtq`). This is a match.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to one `CH` and two `CH₂` groups. Therefore, there is no `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Does not match all data.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOnly structure A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has protons that would give rise to both a `dtt` signal and a `dtq` (or `qdt`) signal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
