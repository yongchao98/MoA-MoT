    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem is based on the energy-time uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics. This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth of an energy level).\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the quantum state.\n    *   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Define \"Clearly Resolved\":** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be clearly resolved or distinguishable, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths), ΔE1 and ΔE2.\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n    At the very minimum, the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. We will calculate the sum to be conservative.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:** We can approximate the minimum uncertainty using the formula ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime (Δt1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime (Δt2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n4.  **Use the appropriate value for ħ:**\n    *   In Joules, ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n    *   Since the answer options are in electron-volts (eV), it's much more convenient to use ħ in units of eV·s: ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculations.** We can use a Python script to get precise values.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\nt1 = 1e-9  # seconds\nt2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state using the uncertainty principle (delta_E = hbar / delta_t)\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / t1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / t2\n\n# To be clearly resolved, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties\ntotal_uncertainty = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Uncertainty of state 1 (delta_E1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Uncertainty of state 2 (delta_E2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required energy difference > delta_E1 + delta_E2 = {total_uncertainty:.4e} eV\")\n\n# The energy difference should also be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties\nlarger_uncertainty = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\nprint(f\"At a minimum, the required energy difference > {larger_uncertainty:.4e} eV\")\n```\n\n6.  **Analyze the Output:**\n    *   The uncertainty of the first state (ΔE1) is about 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   The uncertainty of the second state (ΔE2) is about 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   The sum of their uncertainties is about 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   This means the energy difference between the two levels, |E1 - E2|, must be significantly greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV for them to be distinguished.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV << 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV << 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV << 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV >> 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The only energy difference large enough to ensure that the two energy levels do not overlap due to their natural linewidths is 10⁻⁴ eV. The other options are much smaller than the calculated minimum energy separation required for resolution.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem is governed by the energy-time uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, which states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), given by the relation:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This energy uncertainty is also known as the natural linewidth of the energy level.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.**\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / Δt₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / Δt₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 2: Determine the condition for resolving the two energy levels.**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths).\n\nRequired energy difference |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the uncertainties:\nΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 3: Compare this requirement with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV   (much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV   (much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly the energy difference in option D is large enough to ensure that the natural linewidths of the two quantum states do not overlap, allowing them to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<D>>>"
