    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Separation Process:**\n    *   The mixture of gases is passed through three tubes to identify its components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, there were no acidic gases in the mixture. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have combined with the copper.\n        *   Mass increase = Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ gas, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation:**\n    *   The total initial mass of salts was 7.20 g. This must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas that is inert to the reagents used and has a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). So, Gas C is N₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the Identity of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts must contain only the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Salts that decompose upon heating to produce only these gases are typically ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. The most common examples are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n    *   **Decomposition reactions:**\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   The problem states we have an **equimolar mixture**. Let's say we have 'n' moles of A (NH₄NO₂) and 'n' moles of B (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   According to the stoichiometry of the reactions:\n        *   'n' mol NH₄NO₂ produces: `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n        *   'n' mol NH₄NO₃ produces: `n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `2n` mol H₂O (halving the second reaction's coefficients).\n    *   **Total moles of products from the mixture:**\n        *   Total N₂ = n (from A) + n (from B) = `2n` mol.\n        *   Total O₂ = 0 (from A) + 0.5n (from B) = `0.5n` mol.\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = `4n` mol.\n    *   Now, we compare these expressions with our experimental results:\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol. So, `0.5n = 0.025` ⇒ `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   Let's use `n = 0.05` to check the amounts of the other products:\n        *   Predicted Moles of N₂ = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 mol. (This matches our result for Gas C).\n        *   Predicted Moles of H₂O = 4n = 4 × 0.05 = 0.2 mol. (This matches our result from Tube №1).\n    *   The hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n4.  **Final Mass Check:**\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ (N₂H₄O₂) = 14×2 + 1×4 + 16×2 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ (N₂H₄O₃) = 14×2 + 1×4 + 16×3 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial weight of the mixture perfectly.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium nitrite):** Formula is NH₄NO₂, which can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium nitrate):** Formula is NH₄NO₃, which can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
