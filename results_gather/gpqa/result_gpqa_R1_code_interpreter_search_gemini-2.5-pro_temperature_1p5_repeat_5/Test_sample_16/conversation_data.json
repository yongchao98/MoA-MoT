    "This problem requires us to determine the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the reaction:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction is given as:\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nThe question asks for the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This means we need to consider the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Determine the Dissociation Constant ($K_d$)**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant ($K_f$):\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nThe problem statement assumes an \"ideal pH,\" which means we can use this absolute formation/dissociation constant without needing to adjust for the protonation of EDTA.\n\n**3. Set up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$             | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**4. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x**\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n$K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nSince $K_d$ is very small, the amount of complex that dissociates ('x') will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nNow, solve for 'x':\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\nTo perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial concentration of the complex\nC0 = 0.02  # M\n\n# Formation constant\nKf = 5e10\n\n# Dissociation constant\nKd = 1 / Kf\n\n# Solve for x using the approximation x = sqrt(Kd * C0)\nx_squared = Kd * C0\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n[execution result]: 6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation shows that $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x'.\n$[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10^-2 M\nB) 1.0x10^-2 M\nC) 6.3x10^-7 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Calcium-EDTA complex. The complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$. The reaction is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex from the ions.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    We need the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. The initial concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$             | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    Here, 'x' represents the concentration of the complex that dissociates, which is equal to the equilibrium concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n\n4.  **Use the Equilibrium Expression to Solve for x:** Now, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the dissociation constant ($K_d$):\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:** Because the dissociation constant ($K_d = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$) is extremely small, we can assume that the amount of the complex that dissociates, 'x', is negligible compared to the initial concentration. Therefore, we can simplify the denominator:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The expression becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration of Calcium Ions (x):** Now, we can solve for 'x'.\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated value ($6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M) matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
