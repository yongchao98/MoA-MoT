    "This problem requires us to find the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can interact with a low-energy Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{-}e^{+}$). The reaction is $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Four-Momentum**\n    Let the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon be $p_1 = (E_1, \\vec{p}_1)$ and $p_2 = (E_2, \\vec{p}_2)$ respectively. The total four-momentum before the collision is $P_{in} = p_1 + p_2$.\n    The four-momenta of the created electron and positron are $p_{e^-}$ and $p_{e^+}$. The total four-momentum after the collision is $P_{out} = p_{e^-} + p_{e^+}$.\n\n    Four-momentum is conserved, so $P_{in} = P_{out}$. This implies their squared magnitudes (which are Lorentz-invariant) are also equal: $P_{in}^2 = P_{out}^2$.\n\n2.  **Initial State ($P_{in}^2$)**\n    $P_{in}^2 = (p_1 + p_2)^2 = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + 2p_1 \\cdot p_2$.\n    For any photon, which is massless, the square of its four-momentum is $p^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 c^2 = m^2c^4 = 0$. Using natural units where $c=1$, $p^2=0$.\n    So, $p_1^2 = 0$ and $p_2^2 = 0$.\n    This simplifies the expression to $P_{in}^2 = 2 p_1 \\cdot p_2$.\n\n    The dot product of the four-momenta is $p_1 \\cdot p_2 = E_1 E_2 - \\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2 = E_1 E_2 - |\\vec{p}_1||\\vec{p}_2|\\cos\\theta$. Since for a photon $|\\vec{p}| = E$, we have:\n    $p_1 \\cdot p_2 = E_1 E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n    Thus, $P_{in}^2 = 2E_1 E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Final State ($P_{out}^2$)**\n    The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. At this threshold, the electron and positron are created with zero kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, the total energy of the final system is just the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron. The rest energy of an electron (and a positron) is $m_e c^2$.\n    The invariant mass of the final system is $M_{out} = 2m_e$. The square of the four-momentum is related to the invariant mass by $P_{out}^2 = (M_{out}c)^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n4.  **Threshold Condition**\n    Equating the squared invariant masses:\n    $2E_1 E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta) = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n    We want to find the minimum threshold energy for the high-energy photon, $E_1$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $E_1$:\n    $E_1 = \\frac{4(m_e c^2)^2}{2E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)}$\n\n    To minimize $E_1$, we need to maximize the denominator, which means maximizing the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. This occurs for a head-on collision, where the photons travel towards each other, so $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (180 degrees) and $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\n    The maximum value of $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n    The minimum threshold energy is therefore:\n    $E_{1, \\text{th}} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2 (2)} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}$\n\n5.  **Calculation**\n    We are given the following values:\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_2 = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Rest energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    Now, we can substitute these values into the threshold energy equation:\n    $E_{1, \\text{th}} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    The question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $E_{1, \\text{th}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    This value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nI will use python to confirm the numerical calculation.\n```python\n# Constants\nm_e_c2_eV = 0.511 * 1e6  # Electron rest energy in eV\nE_cmb_eV = 1e-3         # CMB photon energy in eV\n\n# Threshold energy formula\nE_gamma_th_eV = (m_e_c2_eV**2) / E_cmb_eV\n\n# Convert to GeV\neV_per_GeV = 1e9\nE_gamma_th_GeV = E_gamma_th_eV / eV_per_GeV\n\nprint(f\"{E_gamma_th_GeV:.2e}\")\n```\n2.61e+05\n\nThe calculation gives $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV.

    "The process in question is the pair production from a photon-photon collision: $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$. We need to find the minimum energy ($E_{\\gamma}$) of the high-energy gamma-ray for this reaction to be possible. This minimum energy is called the threshold energy.\n\n**1. Relativistic Kinematics and Invariant Mass**\n\nLet the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon be $p_{\\gamma}$ and $p_{CMB}$, respectively. Let the four-momenta of the produced electron and positron be $p_{e^{-}}$ and $p_{e^{+}}$.\n\nThe conservation of four-momentum states:\n$p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB} = p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}}$\n\nTo simplify the problem, we use the concept of invariant mass. The square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant quantity, meaning it is the same in all inertial reference frames. We can equate the square of the total four-momentum before and after the collision.\n\n$(p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = (p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}})^2$\n\n**2. Calculating the Invariant Mass of the Initial State**\n\nThe left side of the equation can be expanded:\n$(p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = p_{\\gamma}^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n\nFor any particle, its four-momentum squared is equal to its rest mass squared ($p^2 = m^2c^4$). Since photons are massless, $p_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$(p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n\nThe dot product of the two four-momenta is $p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For photons, the magnitude of the momentum is equal to the energy ($|\\vec{p}| = E/c$, or $p=E$ in natural units where c=1). Thus:\n$\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n\nSo, the invariant mass of the initial state is:\n$2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = 2(E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta) = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)$\n\n**3. Calculating the Invariant Mass of the Final State at Threshold**\n\nThe right side of the conservation equation is $(p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}})^2$. At the threshold energy, the electron and positron are created with the minimum possible energy. In the center-of-mass frame of the collision, this means they are created at rest.\n\nIn this frame, the total energy of the final state is simply the sum of the rest energies of the electron and the positron: $E_{total, CM} = m_ec^2 + m_ec^2 = 2m_ec^2$. The total momentum in the CM frame is zero.\n\nThe invariant mass squared of the final system is:\n$(p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}})^2 = (E_{total, CM})^2 - (\\vec{p}_{total, CM})^2 = (2m_ec^2)^2 - 0^2 = 4(m_ec^2)^2$\n\n**4. Finding the Threshold Energy**\n\nNow, we equate the two sides:\n$2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta) = 4(m_ec^2)^2$\n\nWe can solve for the energy of the high-energy photon, $E_{\\gamma}$:\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{4(m_ec^2)^2}{2E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)} = \\frac{2(m_ec^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)}$\n\nTo find the minimum threshold energy for $E_{\\gamma}$, we need to maximize the denominator. This happens when the interaction is a head-on collision, meaning the photons are moving directly towards each other. In this case, the angle $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (180Â°), and $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\nThe term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ becomes $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this maximum value, we get the minimum threshold energy:\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2(m_ec^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(2)} = \\frac{(m_ec^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Rest energy of an electron, $m_ec^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's plug these into the formula:\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$):\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV} = 2.61 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
