    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Understand the concept of Density:** Density is defined as mass per unit volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n\n2.  **Analyze each option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline reference. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** \"Same composition\" implies it's made of the same materials (e.g., a similar ratio of iron core to silicate mantle). However, with 5 times the mass, the planet's own gravity will be much stronger. This immense gravitational force compresses the materials, forcing the atoms closer together. Increased compression means the same amount of material occupies a smaller volume, resulting in a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet's density will be significantly greater than Earth's.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This is the opposite scenario to option (c). With less mass, the gravitational force is weaker. There is less compression of the materials compared to Earth. Consequently, the planet will be \"fluffier\" for its composition, meaning it will have a lower density than Earth.\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to gravitational compression)\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower gravitational compression)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the densities, it is clear that the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density. The greater mass leads to stronger self-gravity, which compresses the planet's material more effectively than in any other case.\n\n<<<A>>>"
