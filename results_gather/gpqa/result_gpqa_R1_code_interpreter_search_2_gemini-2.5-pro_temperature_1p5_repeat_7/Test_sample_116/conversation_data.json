    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property often arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different substituents) or other elements of chirality like axial, planar, or helical chirality. A molecule that is superimposable on its mirror image is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. Achiral molecules usually possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Molecule 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n    *   The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups: carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at 2 and 2', and nitro groups (-NO2) at 6 and 6'.\n    *   The steric hindrance caused by these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n    *   This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar, resulting in a stable, twisted conformation.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality. Therefore, this molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one attached to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R- and S-isomers).\n\n*   **Molecule 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅.\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   The molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the trans isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two methoxycarbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not optically active.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, molecules 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Molecules 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n    Therefore, the correct options are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
