    "*   **1. Understand the Underlying Principle:** The problem involves resolving two distinct quantum energy levels. The key physical principle here is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically its energy-time formulation. It states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can know a particle's energy and the time over which that energy is measured.\n\n*   **2. The Energy-Time Uncertainty Relation:** The formula for the energy-time uncertainty principle is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time (in this case, the lifetime of the quantum state).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n*   **3. Relate Lifetime to Energy Width:** A quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy level (ΔE). We can approximate Δt with the lifetime τ. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, the relation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ is sufficient. This energy width means the energy level is not a sharp line but is \"smeared out\".\n\n*   **4. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **5. The Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the smeared-out energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as separate. The limiting factor is the state with the *larger* energy width, which corresponds to the *shorter* lifetime.\n    *   Larger energy width = ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Therefore, for the levels to be resolved, the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **6. Evaluate the Given Options:** We need to find the option that satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) **10⁻⁴ eV is greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.**\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **7. Conclusion:** Only an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels, broadened by their short lifetimes, can be clearly resolved.\n\n```python\n#\n# A script to confirm the calculation for the required energy difference.\n#\n# Constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_ev_s = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Given lifetimes of the two quantum states\nlifetime1 = 1e-9  # seconds for state 1\nlifetime2 = 1e-8  # seconds for state 2\n\n# Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state using the formula: Delta_E ≈ hbar / lifetime\nenergy_width1 = hbar_ev_s / lifetime1\nenergy_width2 = hbar_ev_s / lifetime2\n\n# To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater\n# than the broader of the two energy widths.

    "To solve this problem, we need to use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which can be stated as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ\n\nWhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the energy width of the state.\n*   **Δt** is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThis principle implies that a quantum state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy level. Instead, its energy is \"smeared out\" over a range ΔE. To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies (E₂ - E₁) must be larger than the energy widths of the individual states. We should consider the larger of the two energy widths as the limiting factor.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state.**\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 2: Determine the condition for resolution.**\n\nTo resolve the two energy levels, their energy separation must be greater than the broader energy width. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width.\n\n*   Larger energy width = ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the levels to be clearly resolved is:\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the given options.**\n\nWe check which of the given options satisfies this condition:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.**\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly the energy difference in option C is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<C>>>"
