    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of stereoisomers for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.\n\n### Step 1: Draw the chemical structure from the IUPAC name.\n\nThe name \"6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol\" can be broken down to build the structure:\n*   **Parent chain:** \"undeca\" indicates an 11-carbon chain.\n*   **Double bonds:** \"-3,7-dien\" indicates two double bonds, one starting at carbon 3 (between C3 and C4) and another at carbon 7 (between C7 and C8).\n*   **Principal functional group:** \"-5-ol\" indicates an alcohol (-OH) group on carbon 5.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   \"6-chloro\": a chlorine (Cl) atom on carbon 6.\n    *   \"2-methyl\": a methyl (CH₃) group on carbon 2.\n    *   \"9-ethyl\": an ethyl (CH₂CH₃) group on carbon 9.\n\nLet's sketch the carbon skeleton and add the groups and necessary hydrogen atoms:\n\n`C¹H₃ — C²H(CH₃) — C³H=C⁴H — C⁵H(OH) — C⁶H(Cl) — C⁷H=C⁸H — C⁹H(CH₂CH₃) — C¹⁰H₂ — C¹¹H₃`\n\n### Step 2: Identify all stereocenters.\n\nStereocenters are atoms or groups that can give rise to stereoisomerism. These include chiral centers (asymmetric carbon atoms) and double bonds capable of E/Z (geometric) isomerism.\n\n#### a) Chiral Centers (Asymmetric Carbons)\nA chiral carbon is a carbon atom attached to four different groups.\n\n*   **Carbon 2 (C2):** This carbon is attached to:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H).\n    2.  A methyl group from the main chain, C1 (-CH₃).\n    3.  A methyl group as a substituent (-CH₃).\n    4.  The rest of the chain starting from C3 (-CH=CH-...).\n    Since C2 is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is **not a chiral center**.\n\n*   **Carbon 5 (C5):** This carbon is attached to:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H).\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    3.  The part of the chain towards C4 (`-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)₂`).\n    4.  The part of the chain towards C6 (`-CH(Cl)-CH=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)₂`).\n    These four groups are all different. Therefore, **C5 is a chiral center**.\n\n*   **Carbon 6 (C6):** This carbon is attached to:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H).\n    2.  A chlorine atom (-Cl).\n    3.  The part of the chain towards C5 (`-CH(OH)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)₂`).\n    4.  The part of the chain towards C7 (`-CH=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)₂`).\n    These four groups are all different. Therefore, **C6 is a chiral center**.\n\n*   **Carbon 9 (C9):** This carbon is attached to:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H).\n    2.  An ethyl group as a substituent (-CH₂CH₃).\n    3.  The end of the main chain, C10-C11, which is also an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    4.  The rest of the chain starting from C8 (-CH=CH-...).\n    Since C9 is attached to two identical ethyl groups, it is **not a chiral center**.\n    *(Note: While this naming would be incorrect under strict IUPAC rules because a longer chain exists, we must interpret the name as given for the problem.)*\n\nSo, there are **2 chiral centers** (n_chiral = 2).\n\n#### b) Geometric Isomerism (E/Z)\nFor a double bond to exhibit E/Z isomerism, each carbon atom of the double bond must be bonded to two different groups.\n\n*   **C3=C4 double bond:**\n    *   C3 is bonded to -H and a `-CH(CH₃)₂` group (different).\n    *   C4 is bonded to -H and a `-CH(OH)-...` group (different).\n    Thus, the **C3=C4 double bond can have E/Z isomers**.\n\n*   **C7=C8 double bond:**\n    *   C7 is bonded to -H and a `-CH(Cl)-...` group (different).\n    *   C8 is bonded to -H and a `-CH(CH₂CH₃)₂` group (different).\n    Thus, the **C7=C8 double bond can have E/Z isomers**.\n\nSo, there are **2 double bonds** that can exhibit geometric isomerism (n_geo = 2).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total number of stereoisomers.\n\nThe total number of stereocenters in the molecule is the sum of the chiral centers and the stereogenic double bonds.\nTotal stereocenters (n) = n_chiral + n_geo = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nThe maximum number of stereoisomers for a molecule with 'n' stereocenters and no internal plane of symmetry (i.e., no meso compounds) is given by the formula 2ⁿ.\n\nThe molecule is unsymmetrical because the two ends are different (`-CH(CH₃)₂` vs. `-CH(CH₂CH₃)₂`), and the arrangement of substituents (-OH and -Cl) does not allow for a plane of symmetry. Therefore, no meso compounds are possible.\n\nTotal number of stereoisomers = 2ⁿ = 2⁴ = 16."
