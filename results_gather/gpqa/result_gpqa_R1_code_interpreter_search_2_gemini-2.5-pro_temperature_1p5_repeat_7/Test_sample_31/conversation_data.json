    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Composition:**\n    *   The problem specifies the nucleus \"X\" as \"Li with 3 neutrons\".\n    *   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it always has 3 protons.\n    *   The number of neutrons (N) is given as 3.\n    *   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus in question is an isotope of Lithium, specifically Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n2.  **State the Goal and Relevant Physics Principle:**\n    *   The goal is to calculate the total energy (E) of the $^6$Li nucleus when it's moving at a speed (v) of 0.96c (where c is the speed of light).\n    *   Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n    *   The formula for the total relativistic energy of a particle is:\n        E = γ * E₀\n    *   Where:\n        *   E₀ is the rest energy of the particle (E₀ = m₀c²).\n        *   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   We are given v = 0.96c, which means v/c = 0.96.\n    *   First, calculate (v/c)²: (0.96)² = 0.9216.\n    *   Next, calculate 1 - (v/c)²: 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.\n    *   Then, take the square root: √0.0784 = 0.28.\n    *   Finally, calculate γ: γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.571428.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀):**\n    *   There are two common ways to determine the rest energy of a nucleus:\n        a)  Using the precise measured mass of the nucleus.\n        b)  Approximating the mass by summing the masses of its individual constituent protons and neutrons (ignoring nuclear binding energy).\n    *   Let's explore method (b), as it is common in physics problems and often leads to the intended answer.\n    *   We need the rest masses of a proton (m_p) and a neutron (m_n). Using standard values in energy units:\n        *   Rest energy of a proton (E_p) ≈ 938.272 MeV\n        *   Rest energy of a neutron (E_n) ≈ 939.565 MeV\n    *   The rest energy of the constituents of a $^6$Li nucleus is the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons:\n        E₀ = (3 * E_p) + (3 * E_n)\n        E₀ = 3 * (938.272 MeV + 939.565 MeV)\n        E₀ = 3 * (1877.837 MeV)\n        E₀ ≈ 5633.511 MeV\n    *   To match the units of the answer options, we convert MeV to GeV:\n        E₀ ≈ 5.6335 GeV.\n\n    *(Note: Using the actual nuclear mass of $^6$Li, which accounts for binding energy, gives a rest energy E₀ ≈ 5.6014 GeV. This would lead to a total energy E ≈ 20.005 GeV. This is less close to the provided options than the result from the constituent mass approximation.)*\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E):**\n    *   Now, we use the main formula E = γ * E₀.\n    *   E = (1 / 0.28) * 5.6335 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 20.1197 GeV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated energy is E ≈ 20.120 GeV.\n    *   Let's look at the given options:\n        A) 21.419 GeV\n        B) 20.132 GeV\n        C) 23.069 GeV\n        D) 18.475 GeV\n    *   Our calculated value of 20.120 GeV is extremely close to option B) 20.132 GeV. The minor difference of about 0.06% is likely due to using slightly different values for the proton/neutron masses when the question was formulated.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants in GeV\nE0_p = 0.938272  # Rest energy of a proton\nE0_n = 0.939565  # Rest energy of a neutron\n\n# Nucleus composition for 6Li\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# Calculate the rest energy by summing the constituents (ignoring binding energy)\nE0 = num_protons * E0_p + num_neutrons * E0_n\n\n# Given speed\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# Calculate total energy\nE_total = gamma * E0\n\nprint(f\"Rest Energy E0 (GeV): {E0:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Lorentz Factor gamma: {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Total Energy E (GeV): {E_total:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\nRest Energy E0 (GeV): 5.6335\nLorentz Factor gamma: 3.5714\nTotal Energy E (GeV): 20.1197\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 20.120 GeV, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine the total relativistic energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Composition:**\n    *   The nucleus is Lithium (Li), which has an atomic number of 3 (Z=3 protons).\n    *   It is specified to have 3 neutrons (N=3).\n    *   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n2.  **Determine the Rest Energy (E₀):**\n    *   The rest energy of the nucleus can be approximated by summing the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons. We use the standard values in GeV (Giga-electron Volts):\n        *   Rest energy of a proton (E_p) ≈ 0.938272 GeV\n        *   Rest energy of a neutron (E_n) ≈ 0.939565 GeV\n    *   The total rest energy E₀ for $^6$Li is:\n        E₀ = (3 * E_p) + (3 * E_n)\n        E₀ = 3 * (0.938272 GeV + 0.939565 GeV)\n        E₀ = 3 * (1.877837 GeV)\n        E₀ ≈ 5.6335 GeV\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The total relativistic energy (E) is given by the formula E = γ * E₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n    *   The speed is given as v = 0.96c, which means v/c = 0.96.\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96)²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28\n    *   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E):**\n    *   Now, we multiply the Lorentz factor by the rest energy:\n        E = γ * E₀\n        E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV\n        E ≈ 20.1197 GeV\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   Our calculated energy is approximately 20.120 GeV.\n    *   Comparing this value to the given choices:\n        A) 21.419 GeV\n        B) 20.132 GeV\n        C) 23.069 GeV\n        D) 18.475 GeV\n    *   The calculated value of 20.1197 GeV is extremely close to option B, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference is due to the precise values of physical constants used in the problem's formulation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
