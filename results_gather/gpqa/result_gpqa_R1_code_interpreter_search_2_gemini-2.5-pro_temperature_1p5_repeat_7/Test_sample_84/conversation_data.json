    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the distance from the star).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that the star is the same for both planets (so T_star and R_star are constant) and that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    This means the ratio of the temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances.\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Data:** We are not given the orbital distances (a_1, a_2) directly. We must derive them from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV method measures the \"wobble\" of the star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. This wobble causes a Doppler shift in the star's light.\n\n6.  **Radial Velocity and Doppler Shift:** The maximum velocity of the star's wobble (the radial velocity amplitude, K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) by:\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    where c is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n7.  **Radial Velocity and Planet Properties:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude K is also given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where:\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    (This assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, and the orbital inclination is close to 90 degrees, which is a safe assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods).\n\n8.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We need to rearrange the formula to solve for 'a':\n    K² = (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    a = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n9.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K_2²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K_1²) ]\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2² * K_1²) / (M_p1² * K_2²)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)²\n\n10. **Substitute Doppler Shift for Velocity:** We know that K is proportional to Δλ (since c and λ_0 are constant). Therefore, the ratio K_1 / K_2 is equal to the ratio Δλ_1 / Δλ_2. Let's substitute this into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)²\n\n11. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute this expression for a_2 / a_1 back into our simplified temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt[ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)² ]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\n12. **Plug in the Values and Compute:**\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ_1) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ_2) = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nLet's perform the final calculation.\n```python\n# Given values\nM_p1 = 7  # Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5  # Earth masses\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes a2/a1\n# a2/a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (delta_lambda_1/delta_lambda_2)^2\na2_over_a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)**2 * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt(a2/a1)\n# which simplifies to (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\ntemp_ratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.5357, which rounds to 0.54 or 0.53 depending on the precision.

    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere:\n*   `T_eq` is the planet's equilibrium temperature.\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`), we can set up a ratio of their respective equations:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\nAccording to the problem, both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both) and have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`). This allows us to cancel these terms, simplifying the ratio to:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) = sqrt(1/a_1) / sqrt(1/a_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a_2 / a_1`). We can derive this from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum radial velocity (`K`) induced on the star by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\n`K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)]`\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\nThe radial velocity `K` is directly proportional to the Doppler shift `Δλ` (since `K = c * Δλ / λ`, where `c` and `λ` are constants). Therefore, the ratio `K_1 / K_2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`. Substituting this in:\n\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\nFinally, we substitute this back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt[ (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 ]`\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (`M_p1`) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (`M_p2`) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (`Δλ_1`) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (`Δλ_2`) = 0.04 Å\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536, which is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
