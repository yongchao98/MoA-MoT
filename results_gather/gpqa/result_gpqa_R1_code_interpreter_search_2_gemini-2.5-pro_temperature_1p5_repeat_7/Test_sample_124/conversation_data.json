    "This problem requires finding the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe potential given is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is the same in all directions, as it only depends on the radial distance $r$.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). The total energy is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\nThe energy for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\nSo, the total energy for the 3D system is:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n**2. Identify the Third Excited State and Calculate its Energy**\n\nThe energy levels are ordered by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** $n = 0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n = 1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n = 2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n = 3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same total energy. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n$n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$\n\nWe can list all the possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0. The combinations are: (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3). This gives 3 states.\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0. The combinations are all permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2). This gives 6 states.\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1. The combination is: (1, 1, 1). This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities:\nDegeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the general formula for the degeneracy of the n-th level of a D-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, which is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$g_n = \\binom{n+D-1}{D-1}$\nFor our case, $n=3$ and the number of dimensions $D=3$.\n$g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$\nB) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$\nC) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$\nD) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$\n\nOur calculated values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
