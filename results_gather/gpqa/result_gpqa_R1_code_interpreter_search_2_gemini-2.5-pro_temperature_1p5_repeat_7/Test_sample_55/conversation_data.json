    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay process for a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ (also known as the 3s state) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩ (the 1s ground state). The transitions are electric dipole (E1) transitions, which must obey the following selection rules:\n    *   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Change in the magnetic quantum number: Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n\n2.  **Determine the First Transition and Intermediate State**\n    *   **Initial State**: |i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ (l=0)\n    *   **Intermediate State**: |int⟩ = |n',l',m'⟩\n    *   Applying the selection rule Δl = ±1 to the initial state (l=0), the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so n' < 3.\n    *   The lowest possible value for n when l=1 is n=2. Therefore, the intermediate state must have n'=2 and l'=1.\n    *   The direct decay |3,0,0⟩ → |1,1,m'⟩ is not possible since the principal quantum number n must be strictly greater than the orbital quantum number l (n > l), so n=1, l=1 is not a valid state.\n    *   Thus, the only possible intermediate state manifold is |2,1,m'⟩ (the 2p states).\n    *   Applying the selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 to the initial state (m=0), the possible values for m' in the intermediate state are m' = 0, -1, or 1.\n    *   So, the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩, where m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Transition**\n    *   **Intermediate State**: |int⟩ = |2,1,m'⟩ (l=1)\n    *   **Final State**: |f⟩ = |1,0,0⟩ (l=0)\n    *   Applying the selection rule Δl = ±1 to the intermediate state (l'=1), the final state can have l_final = 0 or l_final = 2. The given final state |1,0,0⟩ has l=0, so this transition is allowed (Δl = -1).\n    *   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: m_final - m' = 0 - m' must be 0, ±1. This condition is satisfied for all possible m' values (-1, 0, 1).\n    *   So, all three pathways are allowed by the selection rules:\n        *   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        *   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        *   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\n    *   **Probability of the First Step**:\n        The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (l=0, m=0). This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, when it decays, it is equally likely to transition into any of the available magnetic sublevels (m') of the final l'=1 state. The transition probability is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, and due to rotational invariance, this value is the same for m'=-1, 0, and 1 when starting from an m=0 state.\n        Let P(m') be the probability of transitioning to the state |2,1,m'⟩. Then:\n        P(-1) = P(0) = P(1)\n        Since these are the only possible E1 decay channels from the |3,0,0⟩ state, the sum of their probabilities must be 1:\n        P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1\n        Therefore, the probability for transitioning into any specific m' state is 1/3.\n        *   Branching Ratio for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ is 1/3.\n        *   Branching Ratio for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,±1⟩ is also 1/3.\n\n    *   **Probability of the Second Step**:\n        Consider the decay from an intermediate state, for example |2,1,0⟩. This is a 2p state. According to the selection rules, it can only decay to a state with l=0 or l=2 and lower energy (n<2). The only such state is the |1,0,0⟩ ground state. There are no other E1-allowed decay channels.\n        Therefore, if an atom reaches any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, it is certain to decay to the |1,0,0⟩ state. The probability of this second step is 1.\n        *   Branching Ratio for |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability of the Cascade**:\n        The overall probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step. For the route specified in options A and D:\n        Route: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        Probability = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n        Probability = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   A) Route is correct, but probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect.\n    *   B) Route is possible, but probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$. Incorrect. (The correct probability for this route is also 1/3).\n    *   C) Route is possible, but probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$. Incorrect. (The correct probability for this route is also 1/3).\n    *   D) Route is |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, option D provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>"
