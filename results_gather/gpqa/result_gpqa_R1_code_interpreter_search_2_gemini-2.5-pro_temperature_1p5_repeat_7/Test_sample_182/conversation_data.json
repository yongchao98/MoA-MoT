    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** \"cyclohex-3-ene\" indicates a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **Principal functional group:** \"carboxylic acid\" (-COOH) is the highest priority group, so it is located at position C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   \"2-formyl\": An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position C2.\n    *   \"5-vinyl\": A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position C5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **10**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n    *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = **3**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):**\n    *   Hydrogen on C1: 1H (bonded to C2, C6, -COOH).\n    *   Hydrogen on C2: 1H (bonded to C1, C3, -CHO).\n    *   Hydrogen on C3: 1H (part of C=C).\n    *   Hydrogen on C4: 1H (part of C=C).\n    *   Hydrogen on C5: 1H (bonded to C4, C6, vinyl group).\n    *   Hydrogens on C6: 2H (CH₂ group).\n    *   Hydrogen in -COOH: 1H.\n    *   Hydrogen in -CHO: 1H.\n    *   Hydrogens in -CH=CH₂: 3H.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = **12**.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant (optional but good for checking).**\n\nThe formula for IHD (also known as degrees of unsaturation) is:\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 ring\n*   1 C=C bond in the ring\n*   1 C=C bond in the vinyl group\n*   1 C=O bond in the formyl group\n*   1 C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. This confirms the structure is correctly interpreted.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the reaction and predict the product's structure.**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to carry out the following transformations:\n*   Reduction of carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Reduction of aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nApplying this to our reactant:\n*   The cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring (C=C → C-C).\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) at C2 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton remains intact (10 carbon atoms), and all oxygen atoms are removed. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane with substituents. Specifically, it will be an isomer of ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane.\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the molecular formula of the product.**\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains one ring and is fully saturated (no double or triple bonds). A cycloalkane has the general molecular formula **CnH2n**.\n\nSince the number of carbon atoms is conserved, the product will have 10 carbon atoms (n=10).\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H(2*10) = C10H20**.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nUsing the IHD formula for the product, C10H20:\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be determined directly from the structure of the product. The product is a saturated molecule containing one ring.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π-bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1."
