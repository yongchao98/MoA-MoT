    "An essential principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The state of the coupled system is described by the total angular momentum quantum number, $l$, and its z-component, $m$. The state of the uncoupled system is described by the individual angular momentum z-components of the particles, $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   This means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $m=-1$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the final state of measurement:** We are measuring the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalues $-\\hbar$ for both.\n    *   This corresponds to measuring the quantum numbers $m_{l1} = -1$ for the first electron and $m_{l2} = -1$ for the second electron.\n    *   This final state in the uncoupled basis is denoted as $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum:** The total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved. This means that the sum of the individual z-components in any possible measurement outcome must equal the total z-component of the initial state.\n    *   The z-component quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n    *   The sum of the z-component quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n4.  **Compare the z-components:** We compare the total z-component of the initial state with the total z-component of the final measured state.\n    *   Initial state: $m = -1$\n    *   Final state: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$\n    *   Since $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), this measurement outcome is not possible.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability:** The probability of a transition from an initial state $|\\psi_i>$ to a final state $|\\psi_f>$ is given by $|\\langle \\psi_f | \\psi_i \\rangle|^2$. In this case, we need to calculate the probability:\n    $P(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1) = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n    The term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, often written as $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$. A fundamental property (selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\n    Since in our case $-1 \\neq (-1) + (-1)$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nThe joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>"
