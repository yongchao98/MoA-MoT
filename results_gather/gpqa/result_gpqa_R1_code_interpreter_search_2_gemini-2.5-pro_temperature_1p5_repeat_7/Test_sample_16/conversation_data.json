    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from a solution of Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions. The dissociation reaction is:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Define the formation constant ($K_f$):** The problem provides the formation constant, which describes the formation of the complex (the reverse reaction):\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):** We are starting with 0.02 M of the complex, which will then dissociate.

This means very little of it will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.

    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Write the chemical equation for the dissociation of the complex.**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$, dissociates into its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction is:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the given formation constant ($K_f$).**\n    The problem provides the formation constant ($K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which corresponds to the formation of the complex (the reverse of the dissociation reaction):\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$\n    The equilibrium expression for the formation constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.

Therefore, 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for x, which represents $[Ca^{2+}] $.**\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    Now, take the square root to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Final check.**\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions is $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value matches option B. The initial approximation (x << 0.02) is valid, as $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ is much smaller than 0.02.\n\n<<<B>>>"
