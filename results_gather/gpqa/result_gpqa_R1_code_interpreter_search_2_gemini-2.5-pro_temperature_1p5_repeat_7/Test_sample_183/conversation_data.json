    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a trisubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are:\n    *   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position C1.\n    *   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at position C2.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at position C3.\n*   The arrangement is 1,2,3-substitution.\n*   The directing effects of the groups are:\n    *   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n\nThe 1,2,3 arrangement is sterically crowded and can be challenging to synthesize directly because the directing effects of the substituents often lead to other isomers (e.g., 1,2,4 or 1,3,5).\n\n### 2. General Synthetic Strategy\n\nLet's work backward from the target molecule:\n*   **Final Step:** The presence of an ethoxy group suggests a Williamson ether synthesis as the final step. This reaction involves a phenoxide and an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr).\n    *   `...-ONa + EtBr -> ...-OEt`\n    *   This means the penultimate intermediate (the precursor) must be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **Formation of the Phenol:** A common way to synthesize phenols, especially with specific substitution patterns, is through the diazotization of an aniline followed by hydrolysis.\n    *   `...-NH2 --(NaNO2, HCl)--> ...-N2+ --(H2O, heat)--> ...-OH`\n    *   This implies that the precursor to the phenol is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **The Core Problem:** The main challenge is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. This molecule has an amino group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group in a 1,2,3 relationship.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options based on the Synthesis of the Key Intermediate\n\nNow, let's examine each option to see if it provides a viable route to **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** or a closely related, correct precursor.\n\n#### Option A\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the para position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic use of a blocking group.\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. The para position is blocked. The -tBu group is o,p-directing, and the -SO3H group is m-directing. Both direct the new substituent to the position ortho to the -tBu group (C2). Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\nThe substituents are at positions 1 (tBu), 2 (NO2), and 4 (SO3H). This is a 1,2,4-substitution pattern. Any subsequent modifications (e.g., reduction of NO2, diazotization, replacement of SO3H) will be based on this 1,2,4-skeleton, which cannot be rearranged to the required 1,2,3 pattern of the final product. Therefore, this path leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n#### Option C\nThis option has `iv) NaNO2/HCl` following steps that produce **4-nitro-2-tert-butyl-benzenesulfonic acid**. The `NaNO2/HCl` reagent is for diazotization, which requires an amine (-NH2) group. There is no amine present at this stage. Therefore, this sequence is chemically incorrect as written.\n\n#### Option D\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. This gives mainly the para-substituted product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. Product: **p-tert-butylaniline** (4-tert-butylaniline).\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of the aniline. (This must involve protection of the amine as an acetamide, -NHAc, to prevent oxidation and control substitution). The -NHAc and -tBu groups are para to each other. Both are o,p-directors. The powerful -NHAc group directs nitration to its ortho position. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\nThis intermediate has a 1,2,4-substitution pattern. Like option A, this route leads to the wrong final isomer.\n\n#### Option B\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction. Product: Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. Under strongly acidic conditions (which Friedel-Crafts requires), aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a meta-director. Therefore, this step can produce **m-tert-butylaniline**. This is a non-trivial but known reaction.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of m-tert-butylaniline (again, assuming protection as an acetamide). The substrate is **N-(3-tert-butylphenyl)acetamide**. The -NHAc group (at C1) is o,p-directing (to C2, C4, C6). The -tBu group (at C3) is also o,p-directing (to C2, C4, C6).\n    *   Nitration can occur at C2, which is ortho to both groups. Although sterically hindered, it is electronically favored by both activating groups. This would give **3-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline** (after deprotection).\nLet's analyze the subsequent steps to form the target molecule from this intermediate:\n*   Precursor Aniline: **3-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline** (NH2 at C1, NO2 at C2, tBu at C3).\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amine.\n*   viii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. Product: **3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n*   ix) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. Product: **3-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nLet's carefully check if **3-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene** is the same as the target, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   Product from B: OEt at C1, NO2 at C2, tBu at C3.\n*   Target Molecule: OEt at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3.\nThese are different isomers. There seems to be an error in the question's target name or the options provided.\n\nHowever, let's re-evaluate. Option B is the *only* pathway that generates a 1,2,3-trisubstituted aromatic ring, which matches the substitution pattern of the target molecule. The other viable paths (A and D) exclusively produce 1,2,4-isomers. While the path in B may result in a low yield of the required nitrated intermediate and gives an isomer different from the one named, it is the only option that accesses the correct substitution pattern. The steps `vi) SO3/H2SO4` and `vii) dilute H2SO4` appear redundant and are likely included as distractors. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options lead to fundamentally different structural types, option B stands out as the most plausible intended answer, despite its flaws.\n\n<<<B>>>"
