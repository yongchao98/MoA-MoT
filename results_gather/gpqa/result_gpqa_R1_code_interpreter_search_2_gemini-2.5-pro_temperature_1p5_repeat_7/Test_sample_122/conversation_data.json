    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation. We are given the velocity of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy and the time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame. We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   The ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **List the known quantities:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, **v** = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (S'), **Δt'** = 50 s. This is the *proper time* (Δt₀) because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame (the ejecta's frame).\n    *   The speed of light, **c** ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance **d** traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in a stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the proper time (`Δt'`) measured in a moving frame (S').\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, plug this into the gamma formula:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nTo get a precise numerical value, let's execute the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # proper time in seconds in the ejecta's frame\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862.18\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Knowns:**\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame of reference is the Galaxy (let's call its time `Δt` and distance `d`).\n    *   The \"moving\" frame of reference is the supernova ejecta (let's call its time `Δt'`).\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's proper time) is `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Physical Principle:**\n    The problem involves a speed that is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`). Therefore, we must use the principles of Special Relativity, not classical physics. Specifically, we need to account for **time dilation**.\n\n    *   **Time Dilation:** An observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    *   The distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`. Notice that we need `Δt`, the time in the *Galaxy's* frame, not the 50 seconds from the ejecta's frame.\n    *   The time dilation formula relates the two times: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   First, find `v²/c²`: `(60,000 / 300,000)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`.\n        *   Next, calculate `sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`: `sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`.\n        *   Now, find `γ`: `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`.\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n        *   `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`.\n        *   As expected, more time has passed in the Galaxy's frame than in the ejecta's frame.\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`.\n\n    The code I executed in the thinking process performed this calculation precisely: `distance = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt'`, which yielded `3,061,862.18 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect classical answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option C. The slight difference is due to rounding in the answer choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
