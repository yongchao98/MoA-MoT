    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Information**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms (C, O2) and adds one degree of unsaturation (due to the C=O bond).\n*   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents. The benzene ring itself accounts for four degrees of unsaturation.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Two signals suggest a symmetric substitution pattern, such as a 1,4- (para) disubstitution, which would give two doublets. This C6H4 fragment contributes 4 protons to the total count.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very specific and informative splitting pattern. It strongly indicates a propenyl group, `–CH=CH–CH3`.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group (`=CH–CH3`) is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton (`–CH=CH–`) is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   This fragment accounts for one C=C double bond (another degree of unsaturation) and adds 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`-CH=CH-CH3`) to the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One methyl group is the one from the propenyl (`–CH=CH–CH3`) fragment identified above.\n        *   The second methyl group signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since there is an ester group, a methyl ester (`–COOCH3`) is a very likely candidate. A methyl group attached to the ester's oxygen would appear as a singlet, being a distinct signal.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate potential structures. The molecule does not contain any methylene (–CH2–) groups.\n\n### **2. Calculate Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nFirst, let's determine the expected DBE from the identified fragments:\n*   Benzene ring: 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 DBE\n*   **Total Expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the proposed chemical formulas using the formula: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 (for molecules with C, H, and O).\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**. (This matches our expected DBE.)\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = **7**. (This would require an extra double bond or ring.)\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = **5**. (This DBE is too low; it cannot account for the vinyl group's C=C bond.)\n*   **D) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = **6**. (This also matches our expected DBE.)\n\nBased on the DBE calculation, we can immediately eliminate option **C** because it doesn't have enough unsaturation to accommodate a benzene ring, an ester, and a vinyl group. We can also consider option **B** highly unlikely. We are left to decide between **A** and **D**.\n\n### **3. Assemble the Molecular Structure and Final Verification**\n\nLet's assemble the pieces we've deduced from the spectra:\n*   A benzene ring: C6H4\n*   An ester group, likely a methyl ester: –COOCH3\n*   A propenyl group: –CH=CH–CH3\n\nLet's combine these to form a di-substituted benzene. The two substituents would be the methyl ester group (–COOCH3) and the propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total formula for this proposed structure:\n*   **Carbons:** 6 (from C6H4) + 1 (from –COO–) + 1 (from –OCH3) + 3 (from –CH=CH–CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C6H4) + 3 (from –OCH3) + 5 (from –CH=CH–CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 (from –COO–) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This corresponds to option **A**.\n\nLet's check if this structure (e.g., methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate) fits all the criteria:\n*   **Formula C11H12O2:** Yes.\n*   **Ester:** Yes.\n*   **Di-substituted aromatic ring:** Yes.\n*   **NMR signals:** Yes (2 aromatic, 2 vinyl, 2 methyl).\n*   **No –CH2– groups:** Yes, the structure contains only C (quaternary), CH (aromatic/vinyl), and CH3 groups.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining possibility, **D) C12H14O2**.\n*   This formula has one more carbon and two more hydrogens (a CH2 unit) than C11H12O2.\n*   To get this formula from our proposed structure, we would need to add a CH2 group, for example, by having an ethyl ester instead of a methyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`).\n*   However, this would introduce a –CH2– group, which would produce a signal in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n*   The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**. Therefore, the formula C12H14O2 is incorrect.\n\nBased on the complete analysis of all the spectroscopic data, the only possible formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
