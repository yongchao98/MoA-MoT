    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics\n\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) that decays after traveling some distance in a bubble chamber. We need to determine the detector resolution required to observe a certain percentage of these decays.\n\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** The particle is moving at a high speed, so its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) in its own rest frame. The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor relates the total energy ($E$) of the particle to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$) by the formula $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$.\n*   **Decay Law:** Particle decay is a statistical process. The number of particles that travel a distance `x` before decaying follows an exponential law. The probability of a single particle traveling a distance of at least `d` before it decays is given by $P(L \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It's given by $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau$ is its lifetime in the lab frame.\n*   **Observing a Decay:** For a decay to be \"observed\" or \"resolved\", the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's minimum resolution (`d`). If it decays at a shorter distance, its track is too short to be distinguished from the production point. Therefore, \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\" means we are looking for a resolution `d` such that the probability of the track length being greater than `d` is 0.3.\n\n### 2. Formulating the Calculation\n\nBased on the physics, we can set up the following equation:\n$P(L \\ge d) = 0.30$\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) \\approx 1.204 \\lambda$\n\nSo, the main task is to calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$.\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n\nWe can calculate $\\gamma$ from the given energy and mass. The velocity $v$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nLet's use a Python script for precise computation.\n\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Fraction of decays to observe = 0.30\n    *   Speed of light, $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nThe script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = E / (m_0c^2)$.\n2.  Calculate the particle's velocity as a fraction of c, $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n3.  Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame, $\\lambda = \\beta c \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n4.  Calculate the required resolution, $d = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # s\nfraction_to_observe = 0.30\n\n# 1. Calculate Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# 2. Calculate beta = v/c\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / gamma**2)\n\n# 3. Calculate mean decay length in the lab frame (lambda)\n# lambda = v * tau = (beta * c) * (gamma * tau0)\nlab_lambda = beta * c * gamma * tau0\n\n# 4. Calculate the required resolution 'd'\n# P(L >= d) = exp(-d / lambda) = fraction_to_observe\nd = -lab_lambda * math.log(fraction_to_observe)\n\nprint(f\"{d}\")\n\n```\n>>>2.267905864197475e-06\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculation yields a required resolution of $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\nNow, we compare this result to the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is closest to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small discrepancy (about 9%) is likely due to slight inconsistencies in the values provided in the problem statement, which is common in textbook exercises. The order of magnitude and the leading digit match reasonably well.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants to find the minimum resolution needed for a detector to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle $X^0$.\n\n### 1. Identify the physical principles and formulas\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy ($E$) of a particle with rest mass ($m_0$) and Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) is given by $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$.\n*   **Lorentz Factor and Velocity:** The Lorentz factor is related to the particle's velocity ($v$) by $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. This can be rearranged to find the velocity: $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$. It's common to use $\\beta = v/c$.\n*   **Time Dilation:** A particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is dilated compared to its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) in its own rest frame. The formula is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Decay Law:** The probability that a particle travels a distance $L$ greater than or equal to a certain distance $d$ before decaying is given by an exponential decay law: $P(L \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n*   **Mean Decay Length:** The mean decay length ($\\lambda$) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It's calculated as $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$.\n\n### 2. Plan the calculation\n\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, using the given total energy ($E$) and rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n2.  Calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$.\n3.  Calculate the particle's velocity, $v$.\n4.  Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame, $\\lambda$.\n5.  Use the decay law to find the minimum distance (resolution) $d$ for which 30% of the particles will travel at least this far before decaying. This means setting $P(L \\ge d) = 0.30$.\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-d/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 3.

Conclusion\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution required is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nNow, we compare this result to the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close in magnitude to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small difference (around 9%) is likely due to the problem being constructed with slightly rounded or idealized values. Option C is the only one that matches the order of magnitude of the result.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations performed are correct based on the principles of special relativity and particle decay. Let's briefly recap the steps and verify the result.\n\n**1. Summary of Physics and Calculation**\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** Represents the time and space distortion due to relativistic speeds. It's the ratio of total energy to rest energy.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays.

The exact value is $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n    *   $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau = (c\\sqrt{1-1/\\gamma^2}) \\cdot (\\gamma\\tau_0) = c\\tau_0\\sqrt{\\gamma^2-1}$\n    *   Plugging in the values, the calculation yields $\\lambda \\approx 1.88 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n*   **Required Resolution ($d$):** We need to find the distance `d` such that there is a 30% probability the particle travels *at least* this far. This is described by the exponential decay law.\n    *   $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    *   Solving for $d$: $d = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) \\approx \\lambda \\times 1.204$\n    *   $d \\approx (1.88 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n**2. Comparison with Options**\n\n*   **Calculated result:** $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   **Option A:** $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n*   **Option B:** $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n*   **Option C:** $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   **Option D:** $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nThe calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is of the same order of magnitude and numerically closest to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The minor discrepancy (~9%) is common in physics problems where the given numbers may not be perfectly consistent with the options. The other options are off by several orders of magnitude, making them incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most logical choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
