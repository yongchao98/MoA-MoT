    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe problem describes the detection of exoplanets using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method relies on the Doppler effect. An orbiting planet causes its host star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble induces a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines as it moves towards and away from us.\n\nThe observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is related to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) by the Doppler formula:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the RV semi-amplitude ($K$).\n$$ K = c \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} $$\nFrom this, we can see that the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n\n### 2. Relating RV Semi-amplitude to Orbital Parameters\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) can be expressed as a function of the planet's minimum mass ($m_p \\sin i$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the orbital period ($T$). The formula is:\n$$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $$\nwhere:\n-   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n-   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n-   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane). The value $m_p \\sin i$ is the minimum mass detectable by the RV method.\n-   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the host star.\n-   $T$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n\n### 3. Setting up the Ratios\n\nLet's denote the parameters for planet #1 and planet #2 with subscripts 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n-   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n-   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nSince $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\nWe are also given the following information:\n-   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n-   The planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, the measurable quantity is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$. It is a standard convention to report this value. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the problem implies the minimum masses are the same: $m_{p1} \\sin i_1 = m_{p2} \\sin i_2$.\n\nNow, let's write the expression for $K$ for each system:\n$$ K_1 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{star1}^{2/3}} $$\n$$ K_2 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{star2}^{2/3}} $$\n\nTaking the ratio $K_2 / K_1$:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{star2}^{2/3}}}{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{star1}^{2/3}}} $$\n\nThe terms $2\\pi G$, $m_p \\sin i$, and $M_{star}$ are the same for both systems and thus cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(1/T_2)^{1/3}}{(1/T_1)^{1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n### 4. Solving for the Period Ratio\n\nWe have two expressions for the ratio $K_2/K_1$:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\nEquating them:\n$$ \\frac{7}{5} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\nTo solve for the ratio of the periods, we cube both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n$$ \\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $T_2 / T_1$. We take the reciprocal:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nTo get the numerical value, we perform the division:\n```python\nprint(125 / 343)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user's question requires us to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets based on the observed radial velocity (RV) data of their host stars.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to RV Semi-Amplitude (K):**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along the line of sight. The maximum observed shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is called the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n    We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    -   Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n    -   Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude to Physical Parameters:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is given by the following formula:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    -   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    -   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    -   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    -   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    -   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems:**\n    We can write the equation for each system and then take their ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{star2}^{2/3}}}{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{star1}^{2/3}}} $$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio using Given Information:**\n    The problem provides key information that allows for simplification:\n    -   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    -   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the RV method, the measurable quantity is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$. It is standard to assume this means the minimum masses are equal: $m_{p1} \\sin i_1 = m_{p2} \\sin i_2$.\n    -   $2\\pi G$ is a constant.\n\n    Canceling these identical terms, the ratio simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(T_2)^{-1/3}}{(T_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio ($T_2/T_1$):**\n    We now have two expressions for the ratio $K_2/K_1$. By equating them, we can solve for the ratio of the periods.\n    $$ \\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To isolate the period ratio, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which corresponds to the ratio $T_2/T_1$. Therefore, we need to take the reciprocal:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\approx 0.36443 $$\n    This value indicates that the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1 (i.e., it is shorter).\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
