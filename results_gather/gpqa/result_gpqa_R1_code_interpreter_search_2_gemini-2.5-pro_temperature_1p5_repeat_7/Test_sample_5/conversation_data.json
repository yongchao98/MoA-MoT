    "The user wants to find the energy spectrum for a particle in a given potential.\n\n1.  **Analyze the potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n    $V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \\frac{3}{2} kr^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian coordinates:**\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often beneficial to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The transformation rules are:\n    $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n    $y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n    $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    Substituting these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(\\theta))^2$\n    Since $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$, we can replace $r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$ with $x^2$:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n\n3.  **Simplify the potential in Cartesian coordinates:**\n    Combine the terms with $x^2$:\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{4}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n4.  **Recognize the form of the potential:**\n    The potential is now in the form $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, where:\n    $V_x(x) = 2 k x^2$\n    $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    This represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The Schrödinger equation for such a potential is separable in the x and y coordinates.\n\n5.  **Identify the angular frequencies:**\n    The potential for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is given by $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 q^2$, where $m$ is the mass and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n    \n    For the x-direction:\n    $V_x(x) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_x^2 x^2 = 2 k x^2$\n    $m \\omega_x^2 = 4k$\n    $\\omega_x^2 = \\frac{4k}{m}$\n    $\\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n    For the y-direction:\n    $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_y^2 y^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $m \\omega_y^2 = k$\n    $\\omega_y^2 = \\frac{k}{m}$\n    $\\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n6.  **Determine the total energy spectrum:**\n    The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n    \n    Since the potential is separable, the total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies for the independent motions in the x and y directions:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_x + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_y$\n\n    Substitute the expressions for $\\omega_x$ and $\\omega_y$:\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar (2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar (\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}})$\n\n7.  **Simplify the energy expression:**\n    Factor out the common term $\\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n    $E = \\left[ 2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left[ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) \\hbar \\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) E = (n_x + 3*n_y + 3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x + 3n_y + 1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    D) E = (3n_x + 2n_y + 1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    The result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
