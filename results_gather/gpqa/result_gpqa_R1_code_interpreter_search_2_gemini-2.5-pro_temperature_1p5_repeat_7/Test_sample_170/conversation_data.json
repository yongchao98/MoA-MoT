    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the directing effect of each substituent.**\nIn an electrophilic substitution reaction on a substituted benzene ring, the existing substituent directs the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) to specific positions. Substituents are classified as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups direct the new substituent to the positions ortho (2 and 6) and para (4) to the original group. They are typically electron-donating groups (activators) or halogens (deactivators).\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the new substituent to the positions meta (3 and 5) to the original group. They are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivators).\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl carboxylate): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 2: Group the substances based on expected para-isomer yield.**\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer, as the main product is the meta-isomer. The substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order will start with the meta-directors and end with the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   **Lowest para-isomer yield:** Substances 2, 4, 6.\n*   **Highest para-isomer yield:** Substances 1, 3, 5.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances with meta-directing groups (2, 4, 6).**\nThese groups are all deactivators. The stronger the deactivating effect, the more strongly it directs to the meta position, and consequently, the lower the yield of the para-isomer. The order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n`-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`\n\n*   The `-NO2` group is the strongest deactivator, so nitrobenzene (4) will have the highest selectivity for the meta-product and thus the *lowest* yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The `-COOH` group is a strong deactivator.\n*   The `-COOC2H5` group is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` because of the weak electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (`-C2H5`).\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will increase in the following order:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\nThe beginning of our sequence is `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances with ortho,para-directing groups (1, 3, 5).**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This ratio is primarily influenced by two factors: sterics and electronics.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):**\n    *   Both `-CH3` and `-C2H5` are activating alkyl groups.\n    *   The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier (larger) than the methyl group (`-CH3`).\n    *   This increased bulk provides more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making it harder for the incoming bromine to attack there.\n    *   As a result, substitution at the para position is more favored for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene (5) is greater than for toluene (1). Order: `1 < 5`.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkylbenzenes (1, 5) with Chlorobenzene (3):**\n    *   The chloro group (`-Cl`) is an o,p-director, but it is deactivating due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal.\n    *   This inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the more distant para position.\n    *   This electronic effect, combined with steric hindrance from the chlorine atom, makes para substitution highly favorable in chlorobenzene.\n    *   Typically, halogen-substituted benzenes give a very high proportion of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitution reactions, often higher than activating groups like alkyls.\n    *   Therefore, the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (3) is the highest among this group.\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\nThe end of our sequence is `1 < 5 < 3`.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the ordered groups.**\nBy combining the order of the meta-directors and the ortho,para-directors, we get the final sequence for the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
