    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance range (`dN/dr`) and the distance (`r`). We are given how the \"number of stars\" (`N`) varies with parallax (`plx`).\n\n### 2. Interpreting the Given Information\n\nThe core of the problem lies in interpreting the statement: \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". Let's analyze this.\n\n*   **Parallax (plx) and Distance (r):** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The relationship is `plx = 1/r`. A small parallax implies a large distance, and a large parallax implies a small distance.\n*   **\"Number of Stars\":** This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It could mean:\n    a) The cumulative number of stars. For example, the number of stars closer than a certain distance or with a parallax greater than a certain value.\n    b) The density of stars. For example, the number of stars per unit interval of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`).\n\nLet's evaluate the most likely interpretation. In astronomy, star counts are often cumulative. For example, `N(<m)` is the number of stars brighter than magnitude `m`. A similar cumulative count can be defined for parallax or distance.\n\nLet `N(>plx)` be the number of stars with parallax greater than `plx`. This is equivalent to the number of stars within a certain distance `r = 1/plx`. Let's call this `N(<r)`.\n\nThe given relation is `N ~ 1/plx^5`.\n*   If parallax `plx` increases, distance `r` decreases, and we should see fewer stars. The function `1/plx^5` decreases as `plx` increases, which is consistent.\n*   If parallax `plx` decreases, distance `r` increases, and we should see more stars. The function `1/plx^5` increases as `plx` decreases, which is also consistent.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent interpretation is that the cumulative number of stars `N(<r)` is being described.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Relationship with Distance\n\n1.  We start with the given relationship, interpreted as a cumulative count:\n    `N(>plx) ~ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  We substitute the relationship between parallax and distance, `plx = 1/r`. `N(>plx)` becomes `N(<r)`, the number of stars within distance `r`.\n    `N(<r) ~ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n\n3.  Simplifying the expression gives us the cumulative number of stars as a function of distance `r`:\n    `N(<r) ~ r^5`\n\n### 4. Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Distance\n\nThe question asks for \"how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is the mathematical definition of the derivative of the cumulative number with respect to distance, `dN/dr`.\n\n1.  We take the derivative of the expression for `N(<r)` with respect to `r`. Let `N(<r) = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n\n2.  Applying the power rule for differentiation:\n    `dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5k * r^4`\n\n3.  This shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n    `dN/dr ~ r^4`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes in proportion to `r^4`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
