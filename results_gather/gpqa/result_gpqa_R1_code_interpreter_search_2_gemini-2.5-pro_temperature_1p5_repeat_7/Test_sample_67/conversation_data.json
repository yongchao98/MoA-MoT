    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2.\n    *   Initially, the magnetic field `B` is in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_i = -μ · B = -γB * Sz`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The eigenstates of `Sz` are `|+z⟩` (spin up, eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and `|-z⟩` (spin down, eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   The lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z⟩`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction. The new field is `B * ŷ`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B = -γB * Sy`.\n    *   The system will evolve according to this new Hamiltonian.\n\n3.  **Choose a Method to Analyze the Time Evolution:**\n    We can use the Schrödinger picture, the Heisenberg picture, or the classical analogy of Larmor precession. The Heisenberg picture is often the most direct for problems involving expectation values of operators.\n\n4.  **Apply the Heisenberg Picture:**\n    *   In the Heisenberg picture, the state vector `|ψ⟩ = |+z⟩` is constant, while the operators evolve in time according to the equation:\n        `d(A)/dt = (i/ħ)[H, A]`\n    *   We are interested in the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μz(t)⟩ = γ⟨Sz(t)⟩`. So we need to find how the operator `Sz` evolves in time.\n    *   Let `A = Sz`. The Hamiltonian is `H = -γB * Sy`.\n    *   `d(Sz)/dt = (i/ħ)[-γB * Sy, Sz] = (-iγB/ħ)[Sy, Sz]`\n    *   We use the fundamental commutation relation for spin operators: `[Si, Sj] = iħε_ijk Sk`.\n    *   For `[Sy, Sz]`, we have `i=y`, `j=z`, so `k=x`. The commutator is `[Sy, Sz] = iħSx`.\n    *   Substituting this back into the equation for `d(Sz)/dt`:\n        `d(Sz)/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(iħSx) = γB * Sx`\n    *   This equation tells us that the rate of change of `Sz` depends on `Sx`. We need to find the time evolution of `Sx` as well.\n    *   `d(Sx)/dt = (i/ħ)[H, Sx] = (i/ħ)[-γB * Sy, Sx] = (-iγB/ħ)[Sy, Sx]`\n    *   Using the commutation relation again: `[Sy, Sx] = iħε_yxz Sz = -iħSz`.\n    *   `d(Sx)/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(-iħSz) = -γB * Sz`\n    *   Let `ω = γB`. We now have a system of two coupled differential equations for the operators:\n        1.  `d(Sz)/dt = ω * Sx`\n        2.  `d(Sx)/dt = -ω * Sz`\n    *   To solve for `Sz`, we differentiate the first equation with respect to `t`:\n        `d²(Sz)/dt² = ω * d(Sx)/dt`\n    *   Substitute the second equation into this:\n        `d²(Sz)/dt² = ω * (-ω * Sz) = -ω² * Sz`\n    *   This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The solution for the operator `Sz(t)` will be of the form `Sz(t) = C1*cos(ωt) + C2*sin(ωt)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    *   The expectation value `⟨Sz(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(0)| Sz(t) |ψ(0)⟩` will also follow this oscillatory behavior:\n        `⟨Sz(t)⟩ = A*cos(ωt) + B*sin(ωt)`\n    *   We can find the constants A and B from the initial conditions at `t=0`.\n    *   **Initial Condition 1:** `⟨Sz(0)⟩`. At `t=0`, `Sz(0) = Sz`. The expectation value is in the initial state `|+z⟩`.\n        `⟨Sz(0)⟩ = ⟨+z| Sz |+z⟩ = ħ/2`.\n        From the general solution, `⟨Sz(0)⟩ = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = A`. So, `A = ħ/2`.\n    *   **Initial Condition 2:** `d⟨Sz⟩/dt` at `t=0`. From the operator equations, `d(Sz)/dt = ω * Sx`.\n        `d⟨Sz⟩/dt |_(t=0) = ⟨+z| d(Sz)/dt |_(t=0) |+z⟩ = ⟨+z| ω * Sx |+z⟩ = ω * ⟨+z| Sx |+z⟩`.\n        The operator `Sx = (ħ/2)σx`. `Sx|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|-z⟩`.\n        `⟨+z| Sx |+z⟩ = ⟨+z| (ħ/2)|-z⟩ = 0`.\n        So, `d⟨Sz⟩/dt |_(t=0) = 0`.\n        From the general solution, `d⟨Sz⟩/dt = -Aω*sin(ωt) + Bω*cos(ωt)`. At `t=0`, this is `Bω`.\n        So, `Bω = 0`, which means `B = 0`.\n    *   Plugging `A` and `B` back in, we get the time evolution of the expectation value:\n        `⟨Sz(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n6.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `⟨μz(t)⟩ = γ * ⟨Sz(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    *   This expression oscillates with an angular frequency `ω`.\n    *   We defined `ω = γB`. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n    *   The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which in this context is the angular frequency `ω`.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
