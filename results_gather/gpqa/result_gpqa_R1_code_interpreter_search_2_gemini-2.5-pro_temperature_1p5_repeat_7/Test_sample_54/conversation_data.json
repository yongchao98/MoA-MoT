    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an acetate ester (CH₃-C(=O)O-R).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning there are no adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the presence of an isolated methyl group, consistent with an acetate group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule contains an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). All four possible answers contain this group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the downfield region for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond). The significant deshielding (shift to a higher ppm value) is caused by the adjacent electron-withdrawing oxygen atom of the ester group (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, indicating it is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most critical piece of information for determining stereochemistry. The coupling constant between two protons across a double bond (vicinal coupling) is dependent on their relative orientation:\n        *   **Trans** coupling: J ≈ 12-18 Hz (large)\n        *   **Cis** coupling: J ≈ 6-12 Hz (small)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The large J value of 16.0 Hz unequivocally indicates that the two protons on the double bond are in a **trans** configuration. This immediately eliminates the *cis* isomers (B and C).\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents a methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the typical range for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond, C=C-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** There is a methyl group attached to the double bond, and the carbon it is attached to also has one hydrogen. This fits the structure fragment =CH-CH₃.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic proton region. It is less deshielded than the proton at 7.0 ppm because it is further from the oxygen atom.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This complex splitting means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** part comes from coupling to the other vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). The coupling constant for this interaction would be 16.0 Hz.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** part comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (the one at 1.6 ppm), according to the n+1 rule (3+1=4).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This proton is on the double bond, and is adjacent to both another vinylic proton and a methyl group. This confirms the structure fragment -CH=CH-CH₃.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure and Compare with Options**\n\nLet's assemble the pieces:\n*   We have an acetate group: CH₃COO-\n*   We have a propenyl group with a trans double bond: -CH=CH-CH₃\n*   The proton at 7.0 ppm is bonded to the oxygen, and the proton at 5.5 ppm is bonded to the methyl-bearing carbon.\n\nThe complete structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n```\n      H   CH₃\n       \\ /\n    C = C\n   /     \\\n  H      O-C(=O)-CH₃\n```\n*The proton in green corresponds to the 7.0 ppm signal, and the proton in blue corresponds to the 5.5 ppm signal.*\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This structure perfectly matches our derived structure and all the NMR data.\n*   **B) Cis-propenyl acetate:** This is ruled out because the J-coupling (16.0 Hz) is characteristic of a trans, not a cis, double bond.\n*   **C) Cis-butenyl acetate:** This is a cis isomer and contains a butenyl group (e.g., -CH=CH-CH₂CH₃). The NMR would show signals for an ethyl group, not a doublet for a methyl group at 1.6 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) Trans-butenyl acetate:** While it has the correct trans stereochemistry, the butenyl group would give a different set of signals than what is observed. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
