    "SMEFT, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators represent the low-energy effects of new physics existing at some high energy scale Λ. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian follows a set of fundamental principles. Let's analyze the symmetries listed:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry in special relativity, stating that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. It is a cornerstone of Quantum Field Theory (QFT), upon which the Standard Model and SMEFT are built. All operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré symmetry:** This is an extension of Lorentz symmetry that also includes spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic QFT. The SMEFT Lagrangian, including all higher-dimensional operators, is constructed to be invariant under the Poincaré group.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-known that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry through the weak interactions, as described by the complex phase in the CKM matrix. Since the goal of SMEFT is to parameterize all possible new physics effects, and the SM itself is not CP-symmetric, there is no reason to impose CP symmetry on the higher-dimensional operators. In fact, many SMEFT operators are constructed to be explicitly CP-violating, providing new potential sources for this phenomenon. Therefore, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). The **CPT Theorem** is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry is not a required symmetry. Therefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
