    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and Fundamental Principles:**\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, identical particles are indistinguishable. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are classified as fermions.\n*   **Governing Rule:** Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin up, ↑, or `-1/2` for spin down, ↓).\n*   **Consequence of Pauli Principle:** For each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states (up and down). Therefore, a maximum of two fermions can occupy a single energy level `n`.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n*   The energy levels for a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L` are given by the formula:\n    `E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`\n    where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n*   The problem conveniently defines the base energy unit as `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`.\n*   So, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of `E`:\n    `E_n = n^2 * E`\n*   Calculating the first few energy levels:\n    *   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n    *   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n    *   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n    *   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n    *   and so on.\n\n**3. Calculate the Ground State Energy of the Four-Particle System:**\n*   The ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed by these two particles is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** Sum the energies of all four particles.\n    `E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy:**\n*   The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the ground state configuration to the lowest available energy level in the most energy-efficient way.\n*   The ground state configuration has particles in n=1 and n=2. The lowest unoccupied energy level is n=3.\n*   To minimize the energy increase, we should promote a particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   The new configuration is:\n    *   **Level n=1:** 2 particles -> Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2E`\n    *   **Level n=2:** 1 particle -> Energy = `1 * E_2 = 4E`\n    *   **Level n=3:** 1 particle -> Energy = `1 * E_3 = 9E`\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    `E_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy:**\n*   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find the second-lowest energy excitation.\n*   **Starting from Ground State (Energy 10E):**\n    *   **Possibility 1 (already found):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Total energy = 15E. (This is the 1st excited state).\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1*1E) + (2*4E) + (1*9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility 3:** Move both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2*1E) + (2*9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   Comparing the excited state energies we have found so far (15E, 18E, 20E,...), the lowest is 15E and the second lowest is 18E.\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** `E_2nd_excited = 18E`.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
