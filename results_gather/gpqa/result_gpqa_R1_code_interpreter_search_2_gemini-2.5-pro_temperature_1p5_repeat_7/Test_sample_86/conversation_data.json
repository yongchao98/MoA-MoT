    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogen atoms with two different substituent groups. The core is a C6H4 group.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   We have a C6H4 ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbons.\n*   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and the two carbons needed to reach the total of 8.\n*   A two-carbon substituent containing a carbonyl group can be structured as **-COCH3** (an acetyl group). This is a ketone functional group.\n*   Let's check the carbon count: C6 (ring) + C1 (carbonyl) + C1 (methyl) = 8 carbons. This fits perfectly.\n*   So, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n\n**3. Consider the Isomers and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nSince the ring is di-substituted, there are three possible isomers: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4).\n\n*   **ortho- and meta-isomers:** These isomers have low symmetry. All four protons on the aromatic ring would be chemically different, leading to a complex pattern of overlapping multiplets in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum (typically between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm).\n*   **para-isomer (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone):**\n    *   This isomer is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents.\n    *   Because of this symmetry, the four aromatic protons are grouped into two equivalent pairs.\n    *   The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3) are equivalent (let's call them Ha). They will be the most deshielded (shifted furthest downfield).\n    *   The two protons ortho to the halogen group (-X) are also equivalent (let's call them Hb).\n    *   Each Ha proton is adjacent to an Hb proton, so they will split each other into **doublets**.\n    *   Therefore, the aromatic region should show **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**. A typical chemical shift for protons ortho to a carbonyl on a benzene ring is ~7.8-8.0 ppm.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH3) has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet**.\n    *   This methyl group is attached to a carbonyl, so its chemical shift will be around **2.0-2.5 ppm**. Its integration must be **3H**.\n\nSo, the expected spectrum for the most symmetric isomer (para-haloacetophenone) is:\n*   ~7.8-8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n*   ~7.4-7.7 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n*   ~2.0-2.5 ppm (singlet, 3H)\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The chemical shifts at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic region (which is typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This matches our prediction for para-haloacetophenone perfectly.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, indicating a para-substituted ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3H in the expected region for an acetyl methyl group.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. It only shows one aromatic proton, and the other signals and integrations do not match our proposed structure. For example, there is no 3H singlet for the methyl group.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). If the compound were an aldehyde (like p-halobenzaldehyde), it would only have 7 carbon atoms (C6 + C1 + halogen), not 8. Furthermore, it lacks the required 3H singlet for a methyl group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting the given description (an 8-carbon, di-substituted aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond) is B. The data corresponds to a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
