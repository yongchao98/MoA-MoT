    "*   **Analysis of the problem:**\n    *   The compound is a small, chemically synthesized peptide.\n    *   **NMR Data:** Two peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   These peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   Their combined integral is 1H, meaning they represent one proton in total.\n        *   They are not due to spin-spin coupling.\n        *   This implies the proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   **LC-MS Data:** Two peaks are observed in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace at elevated temperature.\n        *   The peaks have equal intensities.\n        *   The mass spectrometry (MS) data for both peaks is identical and matches the expected mass of the target molecule.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers give different NMR spectra. A mixture of two diastereoisomers would show two sets of peaks. Protons in one diastereomer would have different chemical shifts from the corresponding protons in the other. This is consistent with observing two peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can often be separated by chromatography (LC). This would result in two distinct peaks in the chromatogram. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   **Relevance to peptides:** A common source of diastereomerism in peptides is **atropisomerism**, which arises from slow rotation around a chemical bond, most notably the C-N amide bond (especially with N-substituted residues like proline). The two resulting isomers (rotamers) are diastereomeric if another chiral center exists in the molecule. The interconversion between these rotamers is often slow on the NMR timescale at room temperature, leading to signal duplication. The fact that the isomers are separable by LC, even at elevated temperatures, confirms they are stable enough on the chromatography timescale. This option is highly plausible and fits all the provided data.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This suggests an incorrect synthesis, for example, adding two amino acids where one was intended.\n        *   The resulting molecule would have a different chemical structure and a significantly different (higher) molecular weight.\n        *   The MS data contradicts this, as both observed peaks have a mass consistent with the *expected* molecule, not a larger one. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard (achiral) solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable by NMR. They have identical chemical shifts and would produce a single set of peaks. Two peaks would not be observed for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC-MS:** To separate enantiomers, a chiral stationary phase (a chiral column) or a chiral mobile phase additive is required. On a standard (achiral) LC system, they co-elute as a single peak.\n        *   Since two peaks are seen in both NMR and LC, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate in the synthesis.\n        *   It would be a different molecule from the final product, and would almost certainly have a different molecular weight.\n        *   The MS data shows that both peaks have the mass of the final product, not a precursor. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observation of two species with the same mass that are distinguishable by both NMR and LC is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers. In the context of a peptide, this is very likely due to rotamers resulting from restricted amide bond rotation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
