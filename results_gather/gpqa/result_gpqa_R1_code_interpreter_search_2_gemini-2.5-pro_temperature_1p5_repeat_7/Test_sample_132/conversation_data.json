    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in a buffer solution. The solution contains KH₂PO₄ (a source of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻) and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (a source of its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻).\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and equilibria.**\n    *   The primary buffer system is established by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻, with equilibrium constant Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻, with equilibrium constant Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of the buffer components.**\n    *   The molar mass of KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   The molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles (This is the moles of H₂PO₄⁻).\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles (This is the moles of HPO₄²⁻).\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].**\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka₂:\n        Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.113 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n    *   The concentration of H⁺ is primarily determined by this first equilibrium because Ka₃ is much smaller than Ka₂, meaning the contribution of H⁺ from the third dissociation is negligible.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻].**\n    *   Now, we use the equilibrium expression for Ka₃:\n        Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   We use the concentrations calculated in the previous steps.

    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻. The solution is a buffer made from KH₂PO₄ (a source of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻) and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (a source of its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the initial molar concentrations of the two main components of the buffer system.\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Since KH₂PO₄ provides one H₂PO₄⁻ ion, this is also the moles of H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Since Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O provides one HPO₄²⁻ ion, this is also the moles of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ / Volume (in L).\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles of HPO₄²⁻ / Volume (in L).\n\nNext, we determine the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺], in the buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid because the solution contains both H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n\n3.  **Use the Kₐ₂ equilibrium:**\n    *   The equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant expression is: Kₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]). For a buffer solution, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and base with their initial concentrations.\n\nFinally, we calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻, using the third dissociation equilibrium.\n\n4.  **Use the Kₐ₃ equilibrium:**\n    *   The equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant expression is: Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]).\n    *   We use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻], as its dissociation is negligible due to the very small value of Kₐ₃.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Calculate moles and initial concentrations\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# We assume the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their initial concentrations.\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4(3-)] from the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# We use the initial concentration of HPO4(2-) as its equilibrium concentration for this step.\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.24e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem has been solved step-by-step using chemical principles and verified with a Python script.\n\n**Summary of the Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles:** The moles of the acidic component (H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄) and the basic component (HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O) were calculated from their given masses and molar masses.\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate Concentrations:** The molar concentrations were found by dividing the moles by the solution volume (200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L).\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine [H⁺]:** The hydrogen ion concentration was calculated using the equilibrium expression for the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (Kₐ₂), as this represents the primary buffer system.\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Kₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]) ≈ 8.113 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate [PO₄³⁻]:** The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) was determined using the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation (Kₐ₃), with the previously calculated values for [H⁺] and [HPO₄²⁻].\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.113 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe code output confirms this result: `6.24e-07`.
