    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 10/2 = 10 - 5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH2)** group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n    *   It is too high for a typical amide (which is usually < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n    *   It is in the range for an **ester** (typically 1735-1750 cm⁻¹) or a ketone. For an ester conjugated with a benzene ring, the frequency is lowered into the 1715-1730 cm⁻¹ range. This value fits very well with a conjugated ester.\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-).\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t - triplet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is adjacent to a group with 2 protons, most likely a methylene (-CH2) group.\n    *   This suggests the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene (-CH2) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q - quartet):** This methylene group is adjacent to a group with 3 protons, confirming it is next to the methyl group from the previous signal.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH2 group. It indicates that the CH2 is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen.\n    *   **Combined evidence:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly confirm the presence of an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen**, such as in an ethoxy (-OCH2CH3) or an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) fragment. Given the IR data suggesting an ester, the **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)** is the most likely candidate.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs - broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons like those in O-H or N-H groups.\n    *   **Combined evidence:** This signal, representing 2 protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH2)** group that was identified in the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region (7-8 ppm):** This is the aromatic region, confirming the presence of a benzene ring as suggested by the DBE.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** There are two signals, both doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The two sets of aromatic protons are in different chemical environments. One pair is at a relatively normal position (7.0 ppm), while the other is significantly deshielded (8.0 ppm). This indicates that the ring is attached to one electron-donating group (EDG) and one electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n        *   The **-NH2** group is a strong EDG, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to a lower ppm value).\n        *   The **-COOCH2CH3** group is an EWG, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to a higher ppm value).\n        *   Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the 2 protons ortho to the -NH2 group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the 2 protons ortho to the ester group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the pieces of the molecule are:\n*   A primary amine (-NH2)\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** (H2N-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH3) - Incorrect. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CO-CH2- protons around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** (CH3CH2-O-C6H4-CO-NH2) - Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern. Also, the IR for an amide C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** (CH3CH2-O-C6H4-NH-CHO) - Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H peak in the IR, and the NMR would show a 1H signal for the -NH- proton and a 1H signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) around 8.2 ppm.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** (H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3) - **Correct.** This structure is perfectly consistent with the molecular formula, DBE, IR data, and all features of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
