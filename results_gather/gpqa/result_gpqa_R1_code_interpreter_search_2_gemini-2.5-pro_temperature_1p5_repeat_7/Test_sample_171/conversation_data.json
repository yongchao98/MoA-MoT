    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. We are given that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so this equation is applicable.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in an excited energy state `j` (`N_j`) to the number in a lower energy state `i` (`N_i`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n`N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]`\n\nwhere:\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the respective energy levels.\n*   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature of the gas.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of the population of the excited state to the lower state as `R = N_j / N_i`. The equation can be simplified for a specific transition:\n\n`R = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T)]`\nwhere `C = g_j / g_i` is a constant for the specific atomic transition of iron being considered.\n\n**2. Applying the Equation to the Two Stars**\n\nWe are comparing the same iron transition in two different stars, star_1 and star_2, which have effective temperatures `T_1` and `T_2`, respectively.\n\nFor star_1 (temperature T_1), the excitation ratio is:\n`R_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n\nFor star_2 (temperature T_2), the excitation ratio is:\n`R_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means the excitation ratio in star_1 is twice the ratio in star_2:\n\n`R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n**3. Deriving the Relationship between T_1 and T_2**\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship:\n\n`C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n\nThe constant `C` (which depends on the statistical weights of the iron energy levels) cancels out from both sides:\n\n`exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\n`ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n\nUsing the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n`ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\nTo combine the terms in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n\n`1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation gives:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**4. Substituting the Given Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n*   Energy difference `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n*   The Boltzmann constant `k` is a fundamental physical constant with the value `k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the pre-factor `ΔE / k`:\n\n`ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 0.9995 K ≈ 1 K`\n\nThe problem is clearly designed for this factor to be treated as 1. Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into our derived equation:\n\n`ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n`ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\nThis equation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
