    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The peak is exceptionally broad due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad and centered higher (around 3300-3600 cm⁻¹). The position at 3000 cm⁻¹, overlapping with C-H stretches, strongly suggests a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its position is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch (alkene).\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). This means the molecule must have at least two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which supports the interpretation of the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\nConclusion from 1H NMR: The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio.\n    *   Calculation for the carboxyl group fragment [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × atomic mass of C) + (2 × atomic mass of O) + (1 × atomic mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 1.01) ≈ 45\n    *   This fragment, [COOH]⁺, is a characteristic and very common fragmentation product of carboxylic acids.\n\nConclusion from Mass Spectrometry: The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 strongly supports the existence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options**\n\nFrom the combined spectral data, we have definitively identified two key functional groups:\n1.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n2.  An alkene (C=C)\n\nA molecule containing these two groups must:\n1.  Have **two oxygen atoms** (from -COOH). This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O).\n2.  Have at least **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**. The C=O bond accounts for one DoU, and the C=C bond accounts for a second DoU.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options, C and D, using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   This formula has two oxygens and two degrees of unsaturation. It is perfectly consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexenoic acid).\n\n*   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. It could represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot account for the C=C bond identified by both FTIR and 1H NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only molecular formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid, an alkene, two oxygens, and two degrees of unsaturation—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
