    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics Principles:**\n    *   The problem involves particles decaying as they travel. This is governed by the law of radioactive decay: `N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/T)`.\n    *   `N(t)` is the number of particles remaining at time `t`.\n    *   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n    *   `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles *in the frame of reference where time t is measured*.\n    *   The particles are moving at relativistic speeds, which means we must consider the effects of Special Relativity, specifically **time dilation**.\n    *   Time dilation means that the mean lifetime of a particle as measured in the lab frame (`T`) is longer than its intrinsic, or proper, mean lifetime (`τ`). The relationship is `T = γ * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Break Down the Problem Information:**\n    *   Detector radius, `R = 30 m`. This is the distance particles travel in the lab frame.\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`. This time is constant for both scenarios described in the problem.\n\n3.  **Formulate Equations for the First Scenario:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame is `T₁ = γ₁ * τ = 20 * τ`.\n    *   Plugging these into the decay equation: `1/3 = e^(-t_lab / T₁) = e^(-t_lab / (20 * τ))`.\n\n4.  **Formulate Equations for the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The desired fraction of particles reaching the detector is `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`.\n    *   The new lifetime in the lab frame is `T₂ = γ₂ * τ`.\n    *   Plugging these into the decay equation: `2/3 = e^(-t_lab / T₂) = e^(-t_lab / (γ₂ * τ))`.\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    *   We have two equations and two main unknowns: `γ₂` and the term `t_lab / τ`. The proper lifetime `τ` and the time of flight `t_lab` are constant between the two scenarios. Let's isolate `t_lab / τ`.\n\n    *   From the first equation:\n        `1/3 = e^(-t_lab / (20 * τ))`\n        Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -t_lab / (20 * τ)`\n        Using the log property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n        `-ln(3) = -t_lab / (20 * τ)`\n        `ln(3) = t_lab / (20 * τ)`\n        Multiply by 20 to isolate the constant term `t_lab / τ`:\n        `20 * ln(3) = t_lab / τ`\n\n    *   From the second equation:\n        `2/3 = e^(-t_lab / (γ₂ * τ))`\n        Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -t_lab / (γ₂ * τ)`\n        Using the log property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n        `-ln(3/2) = -t_lab / (γ₂ * τ)`\n        `ln(3/2) = t_lab / (γ₂ * τ)`\n        Multiply by `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = t_lab / τ`\n\n    *   Now we have two expressions equal to the same constant (`t_lab / τ`), so we can set them equal to each other:\n        `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   Solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   I will use a short Python script to compute the numerical value precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial Lorentz factor\ngamma1 = 20.0\n\n# In the first scenario, N/N0 = 1/3. So, N0/N = 3.\n# In the second scenario, N/N0 = 2/3. So, N0/N = 3/2 = 1.5.\n\n# From the radioactive decay law N/N0 = exp(-t_lab / (gamma * tau)),\n# we can derive the relationship: gamma * ln(N0/N) = constant (since t_lab and tau are constant).\n# Therefore, gamma1 * ln(N0/N1) = gamma2 * ln(N0/N2)\n# 20 * ln(3) = gamma2 * ln(1.5)\n# gamma2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n\ngamma2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.18510864332838\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation gives a result of approximately 54.19.

Deconstruct the Problem:**\n\n*   **Setup:** Particles are created at the center of a spherical detector with a radius `R = 30 m`.\n*   **Particle Properties:** They travel at ultra-relativistic speeds (`v ≈ c`) and have a proper mean lifetime `τ`.\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles surviving to reach the detector walls: `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Desired fraction of surviving particles: `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`.\n    *   The goal is to find the required Lorentz factor `γ₂`.\n*   **Multiple Choice Options:** A) 28, B) 40, C) 54, D) 68.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n\n*   **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles `N(t)` remaining at time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/T)`, where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame where time `t` is measured.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to a stationary observer. The observed lifetime `T` (in the lab frame) is related to its intrinsic, or proper, lifetime `τ` (in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `T = γ * τ`.\n\n**3. Formulate the Equations for the Lab Frame:**\n\n*   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the wall of the detector in the lab frame is `t_lab`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic (`v ≈ c`), this time is `t_lab ≈ R/c`. This time is the same in both scenarios because `R` and `c` are constant.\n*   The decay equation in the lab frame is: `N = N₀ * e^(-t_lab / T)`.\n*   Substitute the time dilation formula `T = γ * τ` into the decay equation:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n\n**4. Apply the Formulas to Both Scenarios:**\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   `1/3 = e^(-t_lab / (20 * τ))`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   `2/3 = e^(-t_lab / (γ₂ * τ))`\n\n**5. Solve the System of Equations:**\n\nWe have two equations and two unknowns: `γ₂` and the constant term `t_lab / τ`. We can solve for this constant term using the first equation and then use it in the second equation.\n\n*   From Scenario 1, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -t_lab / (20 * τ)`\n*   Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = -t_lab / (20 * τ)`\n    `ln(3) = t_lab / (20 * τ)`\n*   Isolate the constant term `t_lab / τ`:\n    `t_lab / τ = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n*   Now, use this in the equation for Scenario 2. First, take the natural logarithm of both sides for Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -t_lab / (γ₂ * τ)`\n*   Using the property `ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y)` and also recognizing that `ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = - (1/γ₂) * (t_lab / τ)`\n    `ln(3/2) = (1/γ₂) * (t_lab / τ)`\n\n*   Now substitute the expression for `t_lab / τ` that we found from Scenario 1:\n    `ln(3/2) = (1/γ₂) * (20 * ln(3))`\n\n*   Finally, solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**6.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the physical principle:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The number of particles `N` that survive after a time `t` from an initial population `N₀` is governed by the law of radioactive decay:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`\n    where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the reference frame where the time `t` is measured.\n\n2.  **Incorporate Special Relativity:** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. This means we must account for time dilation. The mean lifetime `T` measured in the lab frame (where the detector is stationary) is longer than the particle's intrinsic *proper lifetime* `τ` (the lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is given by:\n    `T = γ * τ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Set up the equation for the lab frame:**\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall (radius `R = 30 m`) in the lab frame is `t_lab`.\n    *   Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Thus, `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`. This time is constant for both scenarios.\n    *   Substituting the time-dilated lifetime `T` into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles surviving:\n        `N / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n\n4.  **Analyze the two scenarios:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n        *   Fraction of surviving particles, `N₁ / N₀ = 1/3`.\n        *   The equation is: `1/3 = exp(-t_lab / (20 * τ))`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n        *   The desired fraction of surviving particles is `N₂ / N₀ = 2/3`.\n        *   The equation is: `2/3 = exp(-t_lab / (γ₂ * τ))`\n\n5.  **Solve the system of equations:** The term `t_lab / τ` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime do not change. We can solve for this constant term from the first scenario and use it in the second.\n\n    *   From Scenario 1, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -t_lab / (20 * τ)`\n        Using the property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, we get:\n        `-ln(3) = -t_lab / (20 * τ)`\n        `ln(3) = t_lab / (20 * τ)`\n        Now, isolate the constant term `t_lab / τ`:\n        `t_lab / τ = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   Now, take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2:\n        `ln(2/3) = -t_lab / (γ₂ * τ)`\n        Using the property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`, we get:\n        `-ln(3/2) = -t_lab / (γ₂ * τ)`\n        `ln(3/2) = t_lab / (γ₂ * τ)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute the expression we found for `t_lab / τ`:\n        `ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    *   Finally, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the numerical value:** We can now compute the value of `γ₂` using the derived formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We have derived the relationship: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n# Let's calculate this value.\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(3/2)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 54.19. Looking at the multiple-choice options, the closest value is 54.\n\n<<<C>>>",
