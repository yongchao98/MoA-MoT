    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n**Part 1: Identify the compound that does not show tautomerism (Compound A).**\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible forms, called tautomers. A common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift of a double bond. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an alpha-hydrogenâ€”a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must be sp3-hybridized.\n\n2.  **Examine Benzoquinone:** The structure of benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups opposite each other.\n    *   Structure: A cyclic diketone, `O=C1-CH=CH-C4(=O)-CH=CH-`.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (at positions C1 and C4) are the carbons at positions C2, C3, C5, and C6.\n    *   These adjacent carbons are all part of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). They are sp2-hybridized and do not have an alpha-hydrogen in the sense required for keto-enol tautomerism (i.e., on an sp3-hybridized carbon).\n    *   Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Examine Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are `CH2` groups.\n    *   The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons to the carbonyl groups. Each of these alpha-carbons is sp3-hybridized and has two hydrogen atoms (alpha-hydrogens).\n    *   The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize. In fact, it undergoes tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is highly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n    *   So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identify the compound that will show optical isomerism (Compound B).**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism (a type of stereoisomerism) occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in a molecule is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Examine Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3`.\n    *   Let's focus on the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  An ester group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks any element of symmetry (like a plane or center of symmetry) that would make it achiral despite the chiral center.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as two enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Examine Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   Structure: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The key feature is the trans C=C double bond.\n    *   Structure: `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3` (with the `CH3OOC` groups on opposite sides of the double bond).\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's check for overall molecular chirality. The molecule is essentially planar and possesses a center of inversion (a point in the center of the C=C bond through which you can invert all atoms and get an identical molecule). The presence of this center of symmetry means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. (It does show geometric isomerism, its cis-isomer being dimethyl maleate).\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n*   Compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
