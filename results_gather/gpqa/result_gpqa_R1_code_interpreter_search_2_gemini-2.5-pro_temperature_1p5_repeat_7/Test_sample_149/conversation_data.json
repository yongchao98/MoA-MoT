    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO) using NMR Data**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C8H9NO.\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - 9/2 - 0/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a double bond or a ring).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Data Breakdown:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift and triplet multiplicity are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This confirms a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine group (**-NH2**). The broadness is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet splitting means it is coupled to a single proton. This is consistent with the -CH2-CHO fragment, where these CH2 protons are coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amine group (-NH2), and an ethanal side chain (-CH2CHO).\n    Combining these fragments gives the structure of **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (chain) + NH2 (amine) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches.\n    The structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture generates nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. The starting material has a primary aromatic amine. This is a classic **diazotization reaction**, which converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The intermediate formed is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n    Structure: [CHO-CH2-C6H4-N≡N]+ Cl-\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    The diazonium salt is treated with water. This reaction typically involves gentle heating and results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    The product of this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n    Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the conditions for a **self-aldol condensation reaction**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n        Let's determine the structure of the addition product:\n        The main chain is a butanal.\n        `C4H2(p-OH-Ph) - C3H(OH) - C2H(p-OH-Ph) - C1HO`\n        The systematic name is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The reaction is conducted with **heat**. Heating an aldol addition product in the presence of base promotes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated.\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n        A double bond is formed between C2 and C3.\n        The systematic name of this final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the reaction sequence, which includes heat in the last step. The heat drives the reaction past the aldol addition stage to the more stable aldol condensation product through dehydration. Therefore, the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is the expected final product.\n\nFinal Product: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n\nComparing this to the options provided:\nA) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\nB) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure; not a self-condensation product.\nC) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - Matches the derived structure of the aldol condensation product.\nD) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heat.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
