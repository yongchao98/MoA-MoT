    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks us to identify the stereochemistry (R or S) of two starting materials, A and B. Both are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. They undergo two different reduction reactions to form enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A and B):** The structure is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's draw it and identify the key features.\n    *   The parent chain is pentanoic acid, so we have a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at C1.\n    *   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) is on C3.\n    *   `5-isobutoxy-5-oxo`: At C5, there is a carbonyl group (`=O`) and an isobutoxy group (`-O-CH2CH(CH3)2`), which means C5 is an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   The structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)OiBu(5)`.\n    *   This molecule has two functional groups for reduction: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n    *   It has one chiral center at C3, which is attached to H, -CH2CH3, -CH2COOH, and -CH2COOiBu.\n\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered cyclic ester (lactone).\n    *   This lactone is formed from a precursor molecule, **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid** (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`), via intramolecular esterification.\n    *   The chiral center in the lactone is at C4, which corresponds to C3 of the hydroxy acid precursor. Since lactonization doesn't break bonds at the chiral center, the spatial arrangement of the groups is preserved.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Step 1 (Reduction):** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) remains untouched.\n        `A (HOOC...COOiBu)` → `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (HOOC...CH2OH)`\n    *   **Step 2 (Lactonization):** The H⁺ workup catalyzes the intramolecular reaction between the `-COOH` group and the newly formed `-CH2OH` group to form the lactone.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Step 1 (Reduction):** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is initially untouched.\n        `B (HOOC...COOiBu)` → `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate (HOCH2...COOiBu)`\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis and Lactonization):** The H⁺ workup first hydrolyzes the ester (`-COOiBu`) to a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`), yielding the same intermediate as in Reaction 1: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. This then cyclizes to form the lactone.\n        `HOCH2...COOiBu` → `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (HOCH2...COOH)` → `Lactone`\n\n**4. Tracking the Stereochemistry with Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\n\nThe absolute configuration (R/S) of the chiral center can change during a reaction if the priority ranking of the substituents changes, even if no bonds to the chiral center are broken. We need to determine the priorities of the substituents on the chiral center for each molecule.\n\nThe chiral center is C3, attached to H, `-CH2CH3`, and two other groups which change during the reactions. Let's establish the priority ranking for all relevant substituent groups. By comparing the atoms along each chain, the order is:\n`(-CH2-COOiBu)` > `(-CH2-COOH)` > `(-CH2-CH2OH)` > `(-CH2-CH3)`\nFor the lactone, we compare the two chain fragments within the ring attached to the chiral C4: `(-CH2-CH2-O-)` > `(-CH2-C(=O)O-)`.\n\nLet's analyze the change in R/S configuration for each step. A switch occurs if the priority ranking of any two groups is swapped.\n\n*   **Transformation 1: Starting Material → Hydroxy Acid (in Reaction 1)**\n    *   Groups on starting material A: {1: `-CH2COOiBu`, 2: `-CH2COOH`, 3: `-Et`, 4: H}\n    *   Groups on hydroxy acid: {1: `-CH2COOH`, 2: `-CH2CH2OH`, 3: `-Et`, 4: H}\n    *   The group that was rank 1 in A (`-CH2COOiBu`) becomes rank 2 in the product (`-CH2CH2OH`). The group that was rank 2 (`-CH2COOH`) becomes rank 1. The top two priorities are swapped.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step causes an inversion of stereochemistry (R → S or S → R).\n\n*   **Transformation 2: Hydroxy Acid → Lactone (in both reactions)**\n    *   Groups on hydroxy acid: {1: `-CH2COOH`, 2: `-CH2CH2OH`, 3: `-Et`, 4: H}\n    *   Groups on lactone: {1: `-CH2-CH2-O-`, 2: `-CH2-C(=O)O-`, 3: `-Et`, 4: H}\n    *   The group that was rank 1 in the acid (`-CH2COOH`) becomes rank 2 in the lactone. The group that was rank 2 (`-CH2CH2OH`) becomes rank 1. The top two priorities are swapped.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step also causes an inversion of stereochemistry (R → S or S → R).\n\n*   **Transformation 3: Starting Material → Hydroxy Acid (in Reaction 2)**\n    *   Groups on starting material B: {1: `-CH2COOiBu`, 2: `-CH2COOH`, 3: `-Et`, 4: H}\n    *   Groups on hydroxy acid: {1: `-CH2COOH`, 2: `-CH2CH2OH`, 3: `-Et`, 4: H}\n    *   The group that was rank 1 in B (`-CH2COOiBu`) is converted to the group that is rank 1 in the product (`-CH2COOH`). The group that was rank 2 in B (`-CH2COOH`) is converted to the group that is rank 2 in the product (`-CH2CH2OH`). The priority ranking of the groups does not change (1→1, 2→2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step proceeds with retention of configuration (R → R and S → S).\n\n**5. Final Determination**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A → Hydroxy Acid → (R)-Lactone\n    *   The path involves two stereochemical inversions (A→HA is a switch, HA→Lactone is a switch). Two consecutive inversions result in an overall retention of configuration.\n    *   (R)-A → (S)-Hydroxy Acid → (R)-Lactone\n    *   (S)-A → (R)-Hydroxy Acid → (S)-Lactone\n    *   Since the final product is (R), the starting material A must be **(R)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** B → Hydroxy Acid → (S)-Lactone\n    *   The path involves one stereochemical inversion (B→HA is retention, HA→Lactone is a switch). This results in an overall inversion of configuration.\n    *   (R)-B → (R)-Hydroxy Acid → (S)-Lactone\n    *   (S)-B → (S)-Hydroxy Acid → (R)-Lactone\n    *   Since the final product is (S), the starting material B must be **(R)**.\n\nBoth starting materials A and B must have the (R) configuration.\n\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
