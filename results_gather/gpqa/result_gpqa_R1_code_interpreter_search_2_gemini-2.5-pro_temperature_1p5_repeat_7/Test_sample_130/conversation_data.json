    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates high symmetry, where all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons that are deshielded by neighboring electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A peak around 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride. A peak around 137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon.\n    *   The only simple structure that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is derived from the dehydration of maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H singlet) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as the two alkene carbons equivalent (giving two ¹³C signals). The chemical shifts provided are in perfect agreement with the structure of maleic anhydride.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄). This is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at the 5-position and methyl groups attached to all four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, and C4).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Reaction and Product Structures**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the adduct is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the problem statement.\n\n*   **The Products (Stereoisomers):** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   The \"endo rule\" predicts that the major product, formed under kinetic control (which is the usual assumption unless stated otherwise), will be the ***endo* adduct**. This is due to favorable secondary orbital overlap in the transition state.\n    *   The minor product will be the thermodynamically more stable, but kinetically less favored, ***exo* adduct**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry and Structure of the Adducts**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. They are both derivatives of a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene skeleton.\n\n*   **Skeleton:**\n    *   The original C5-CH₂ of the diene becomes the C7-methylene bridge.\n    *   The original C1/C4 and C2/C3 of the diene form the new six-membered ring with the dienophile's carbons.\n    *   A new double bond forms between the original C2 and C3 of the diene.\n    *   Methyl groups are located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C2, C3).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused to the C5 and C6 positions of the new bicyclic system.\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry passing through the C7-methylene bridge and the center of the C2=C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n\n*   **Key Stereochemical Difference:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7-methylene bridge. This places the methine protons on the anhydride ring (H5 and H6) in the ***exo*** position, meaning they point away from the C7 bridge and towards the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7-methylene bridge. This places the methine protons (H5 and H6) in the ***endo*** position, pointing towards the C7 bridge and away from the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the NMR Spectra and the Differentiating NOESY Cross-Peak**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). We are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the major product but far apart in the minor product.\n\n*   **Expected ¹H NMR Signals (due to symmetry):**\n    1.  **Alkene Methyls (Me_alkene):** The two methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their typical chemical shift is ~1.5-2.0 ppm.\n    2.  **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bridgehead):** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their typical chemical shift is ~0.9-1.5 ppm.\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_c):** The two methine protons (H5, H6) on the anhydride portion are equivalent. They will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift is expected to be ~3-4 ppm.\n\n*   **Analyzing Distances for NOESY:**\n    *   **Distance between Anhydride Protons (H_c) and Alkene Methyls (Me_alkene):**\n        *   **In the Major (*endo*) Product:** H_c are in the *exo* position, pointing directly towards the Me_alkene groups. They are **close** in space. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n        *   **In the Minor (*exo*) Product:** H_c are in the *endo* position, pointing away from the Me_alkene groups. They are **far** apart in space. A very weak or absent NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n        *   This perfectly matches the problem's description: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\"\n\n    *   **Distance between Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bridgehead) and Alkene Methyls (Me_alkene):**\n        *   These methyl groups are attached to adjacent carbons (e.g., C1 and C2) of the rigid bicyclic framework. Their distance is fixed by the skeleton's geometry and is nearly identical in both the *endo* and *exo* isomers. If an NOE exists, it would be present in both spectra with similar intensity, so it cannot be the differentiating cross-peak.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Analysis with the Given Options**\n\n*   Our analysis concludes that the differentiating cross-peak is between the **anhydride protons (H_c)** and the **alkene methyls (Me_alkene)**.\n*   Let's check the options:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (fits Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (fits H_c). This matches our conclusion perfectly.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene). This interaction would not differentiate the two isomers.\n    *   C) & D) These options list a 1H doublet, which is inconsistent with the high symmetry of the molecule's main proton signals (which should all be singlets, except for the bridge CH₂ group).\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the 6H singlet of the alkene methyl groups with the 2H singlet of the anhydride methine protons.\n\n<<<A>>>"
