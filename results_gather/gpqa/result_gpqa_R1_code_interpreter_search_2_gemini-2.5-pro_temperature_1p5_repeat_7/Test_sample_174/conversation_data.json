    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The characteristics of this radiation can be determined by a multipole expansion of the source. The lowest order and typically dominant contribution comes from the electric dipole moment, followed by the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Angular Distribution of Radiated Power**\n\nLet's assume the primary radiation mechanism is electric dipole radiation, which is the most fundamental mode. The problem specifies a spheroid with a symmetry axis along the z-axis. An oscillation along this axis creates an oscillating electric dipole `p(t)` pointing along the z-axis.\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) for an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a factor that depends on the magnitude of the dipole moment and the frequency of oscillation.\n\nThe radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the xy-plane).\nThe problem states that this maximum radiated power per unit solid angle is `A`.\nSo, `A = C * (sin²(90°)) = C * 1 = C`.\n\nThus, we can express the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function of `A` and `θ`:\n`dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`\n\nWe are asked to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We substitute this value into the equation:\nPower at 30° = `A * sin²(30°)`\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nSo, the power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `A/4`. The fraction of `A` is `1/4`.\n\nThis result eliminates options C and D, leaving A and B.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nNow, we need to find how the radiated power `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ` depends on the wavelength `λ`.\nThe power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the square of the second time derivative of the dipole moment, which for a sinusoidal oscillation means it is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`.\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the expression `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `f` is the frequency.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is famously known from Rayleigh scattering.\n\nTherefore, a possible form of the function `f` includes a factor of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Results**\n\nCombining the two parts of our analysis:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n2.  The radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThese two results correspond to option B.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Alternative Check: If we were to assume the radiation is from an electric quadrupole instead, the power distribution would be `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` and the wavelength dependence would be `λ⁻⁶`. The maximum for this distribution is at `θ=45°`. The fraction at 30° would be `[sin²(30)cos²(30)] / [sin²(45)cos²(45)] = [(1/4)(3/4)] / [(1/2)(1/2)] = (3/16)/(1/4) = 3/4`. This corresponds to option C. However, dipole radiation is the lowest-order and strongest radiation mechanism unless suppressed by a specific symmetry, making the dipole model the standard and most plausible assumption.)*\n\nFinal Conclusion based on the dominant electric dipole radiation model is:\n*   Fraction at 30°: **1/4**\n*   Wavelength dependence: **λ⁻⁴**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
