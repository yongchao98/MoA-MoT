    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given information\n- **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n- **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n- **1H NMR Data of the Mixture:**\n    - **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n    - **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds\nFirst, let's confirm that all options have the molecular formula C10H14.\n- **Tetramethylbenzenes:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 * C4H12 = C10H14. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers match.\n- **1,4-diethylbenzene:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 * C4H10 = C10H14. This also matches.\n\nNow, let's predict the NMR spectrum for each compound based on its symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    - **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical (D2h point group). It has a center of inversion and two mirror planes.\n    - **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this will be a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    - **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, 5) are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single signal, a **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    - **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    - **Symmetry:** This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    - **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. They are adjacent, but since they are magnetically equivalent, they will not split each other. They will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    - **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent. This leads to two distinct signals.\n        - Me-1 and Me-4: A **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n        - Me-2 and Me-3: A **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n    - **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each, ratio 1:1).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    - **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry. There is no simple symmetry element that makes many groups equivalent.\n    - **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. H4 is ortho to two methyl groups, while H6 is ortho to one methyl group and one hydrogen. Thus, they are non-equivalent. This will result in **two singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    - **Alkyl Protons:** Based on spectral databases, there are three distinct signals for the four methyl groups. Two methyl groups are accidentally equivalent (isochronous) or become equivalent due to conformational effects. The signals are observed as **three singlets** with integrals in a **6H:3H:3H** ratio (which simplifies to 2:1:1).\n    - **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each, ratio 1:1), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    - **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical (D2h point group).\n    - **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    - **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (-CH2-) protons will be split by the methyl (-CH3) protons, and vice-versa.\n        - Methylene (-CH2-): A **quartet** integrating to **4H**.\n        - Methyl (-CH3): A **triplet** integrating to **6H**.\n    - **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n### Step 3: Combine the spectra to match the observed data for the mixture\nWe need to find a pair of compounds from the options that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the observed spectrum: 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and 3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nLet's test the given options:\n\n**A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n- Aromatic: (1 singlet, 2H) + (2 singlets, 1H each) -> At least 3 aromatic signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n- Aromatic: (1 singlet, 2H from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + (1 singlet, 2H from 1,2,3,4-TMB). This gives **two singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio and each signal represents 2H, their integral ratio is 1:1. **This matches the data.**\n- Alkyl: (1 singlet, 12H from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + (2 singlets, 6H each from 1,2,3,4-TMB). This results in a total of **three singlets** (assuming they appear at different chemical shifts). The integral ratio would be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the data.**\n- This option is a perfect fit.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n- Alkyl: The mixture would contain singlets, a quartet, and a triplet. The problem states there are only singlets in the alkyl region. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n- Aromatic: (1 singlet, 2H) + (2 singlets, 1H each) -> At least 3 aromatic signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only combination that matches the 1H NMR data provided is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
