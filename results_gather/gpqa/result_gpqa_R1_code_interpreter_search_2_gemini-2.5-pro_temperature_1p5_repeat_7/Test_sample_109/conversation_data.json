    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown to determine which stars are observable by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Observatory Requirements**\n\nFirst, let's establish the conditions for a star to be observable by both instruments.\n\n1.  **Location & Visibility**:\n    *   **ESPRESSO** is at the Paranal Observatory in Chile (Southern Hemisphere, latitude ~24.6° S).\n    *   **HIRES** is at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, USA (Northern Hemisphere, latitude ~19.8° N).\n    *   For a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination (DEC) must be in a range accessible from both hemispheres. A star at a very high northern or southern declination will not be visible from the opposite hemisphere. The question asks us to disregard pointing limits, so we only need to check if the star is theoretically above the horizon.\n        *   Keck's theoretical southern limit: `DEC > 19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`\n        *   Paranal's theoretical northern limit: `DEC < -24.6° + 90° = +65.4°`\n        *   Therefore, the star's declination must be between **-70.2° and +65.4°**.\n\n2.  **Brightness**:\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) brighter than 17 (i.e., `m_V < 17`).\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) brighter than 16 (i.e., `m_V < 16`).\n    *   To be seen by **both**, a star must meet the stricter requirement, which is `m_V < 16`.\n\n### **Star Analysis**\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) when it's not given directly:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere:\n*   `M_V` is the absolute V magnitude.\n*   `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n*   `A_V` is the total absorption in the V band, calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = -75°)**: This declination is south of Keck's theoretical limit of -70.2°. Therefore, Star1 is **not visible** from the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion**: Not observable by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = 55°)**: This is between -70.2° and +65.4°. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness (`m_V` = 16.5 mag)**: The given apparent magnitude is 16.5. This is fainter than the HIRES limit (`m_V` < 16).\n*   **Conclusion**: Not observable by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = 48°)**: This is between -70.2° and +65.4°. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness (`m_V` = 15.5 mag)**: The problem states the apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag. This value represents the star's brightness as observed from Earth, which already accounts for any interstellar dust. This magnitude satisfies the condition `m_V < 16`.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Observable by both.**\n\n---\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = -48°)**: This is between -70.2° and +65.4°. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness**: We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   `M_V` = 15.5 mag\n    *   `d` = 10 pc\n    *   `A_V` = 3.1 * `E(B-V)` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   `m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24`\n    *   `m_V = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag\n    *   This magnitude (16.74) is fainter than the HIRES limit (`m_V` < 16).\n*   **Conclusion**: Not observable by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = 60°)**: This is between -70.2° and +65.4°. It is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness**: We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   `M_V` = 16.5 mag\n    *   `d` = 5 pc\n    *   `A_V` = 0 (not mentioned)\n    *   `m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995` mag\n    *   This magnitude (~15.0) satisfies the condition `m_V < 16`.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Observable by both.**\n\n### **Final Result**\n\nThe stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
