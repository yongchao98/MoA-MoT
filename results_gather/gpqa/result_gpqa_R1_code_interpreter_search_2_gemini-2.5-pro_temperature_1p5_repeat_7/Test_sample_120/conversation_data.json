    "Here's a step-by-step process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Starting Material:** The chemical name is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` indicates a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` means the atom at position 7 is an oxygen, making the three-membered ring an epoxide. The epoxide is fused across carbons C1 and C6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` means there are methyl groups on carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` specifies the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Rules (as given in the problem statement):**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophilic attack occurs at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereospecificity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n### 2. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack\n1.  The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6. We need to determine which of these two carbons is less sterically hindered.\n2.  **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group (in addition to being part of the epoxide and the cyclohexane ring). This makes C1 a **tertiary** carbon center.\n3.  **Carbon C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom. This makes C6 a **secondary** carbon center.\n4.  A secondary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon.\n5.  Therefore, according to the given rule, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Constitution of the Product\n1.  The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n2.  The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n3.  The oxygen atom remains attached to C1, forming an alkoxide. Upon aqueous workup (which is standard for these reactions), this alkoxide is protonated to become a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n4.  The result is a cyclohexanol derivative. Let's trace the substituents:\n    *   The -OH group is on C1.\n    *   The original methyl group on C1 is still there.\n    *   The new methyl group from the reagent is now on C6.\n    *   The original methyl groups on C3 and C4 are unaffected.\n5.  Now we must name this product according to IUPAC rules. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. The ring is numbered to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Let the original C1 be the new C1.\n    *   Numbering towards the adjacent carbon with the new methyl group (the original C6) makes it the new C2.\n    *   Continuing around the ring, the original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n    *   So, the product has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. It is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n6.  This constitutional analysis eliminates options A and B, which describe a 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (a product that would arise from attack at C1). We are left with options C and D.\n\n### 4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nWe apply the rules of stereochemistry for an Sₙ2 reaction on an epoxide: inversion at the center of attack, and retention at all other centers.\n\n1.  **Map the Stereocenters:**\n    *   Reactant stereocenter `old C1` → Product stereocenter `new C1`\n    *   Reactant stereocenter `old C6` → Product stereocenter `new C2`\n    *   Reactant stereocenter `old C3` → Product stereocenter `new C5`\n    *   Reactant stereocenter `old C4` → Product stereocenter `new C4`\n\n2.  **Determine the configuration of each center in the product:**\n    *   **New C1:** The configuration is retained from `old C1`. The starting configuration is (1R). So, the product configuration is **(1R)**.\n    *   **New C2:** The configuration is inverted from `old C6`. The starting configuration is (6S). Inversion of (S) gives (R). So, the product configuration is **(2R)**.\n    *   **New C4:** The configuration is retained from `old C4`. The starting configuration is (4R). So, the product configuration is **(4R)**.\n    *   **New C5:** The configuration is retained from `old C3`. The starting configuration is (3R). So, the product configuration is **(5R)**.\n\n3.  **Combine the results:** The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nComparing our derived product with the given options:\n*   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur result, (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, matches option C perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
