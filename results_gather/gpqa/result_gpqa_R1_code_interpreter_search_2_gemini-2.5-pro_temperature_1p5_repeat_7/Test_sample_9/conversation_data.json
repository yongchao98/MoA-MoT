    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n**Key Concept:** For planets with the same composition, the density is primarily affected by the mass due to gravitational compression. A more massive planet will have stronger gravity, which compresses its material more tightly, resulting in a higher overall density.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline, which is essentially the planet Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately **5.51 g/cm³**.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as **~5.5 g/cm³**, which is very close to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Since this planet has the same composition as Earth but is significantly more massive, its self-gravity will be much stronger. This increased gravity will compress the rock and iron core more than on Earth, leading to a density that is **higher than Earth's 5.51 g/cm³**.\n    *   **Calculation (for confirmation):** The relationship between mass (M) and radius (R) for rocky planets is not linear because of this compression. A common approximation is R ∝ M^0.3.\n        *   If Mass = 5 M_earth, then Radius ≈ (5^0.3) R_earth ≈ 1.6 R_earth.\n        *   Density (ρ) is Mass/Volume. So, ρ = M / (4/3 * π * R³).\n        *   The new density will be (5 M_earth) / (1.6³ R_earth³), which is about 1.22 times the density of Earth (ρ_earth).\n        *   ρ ≈ 1.22 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ **6.7 g/cm³**.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is less massive than Earth. Therefore, its gravitational compression will be weaker. As a result, its density will be **lower than Earth's 5.51 g/cm³**.\n    *   **Calculation (for confirmation):**\n        *   If Mass = 0.5 M_earth, then Radius ≈ (0.5^0.3) R_earth ≈ 0.81 R_earth.\n        *   The new density will be (0.5 M_earth) / (0.81³ R_earth³), which is about 0.94 times the density of Earth.\n        *   ρ ≈ 0.94 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ **5.2 g/cm³**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the densities:\n*   a) ~5.51 g/cm³\n*   b) ~5.5 g/cm³\n*   c) ~6.7 g/cm³\n*   d) ~5.2 g/cm³\n\nThe planet described in option (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
