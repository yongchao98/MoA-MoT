    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` approaches a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides N approaches infinity. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. In the limit N -> ∞, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem becomes the radius.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`. The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern:\n\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the intensity at the center of the pattern.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number, with `λ` being the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n\nThe intensity minima occur at the points where the numerator is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`. The minima are located at angles `θ_m` that satisfy this condition (excluding the case `θ=0`, which corresponds to the central maximum).\n\nLet `x_m` be the m-th positive zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n\nWe can solve for `sin(θ_m)`:\n\n`sin(θ_m) = x_m * λ / (2π * a)`\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), so the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n\n`θ_m ≈ x_m * λ / (2π * a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [x₂ * λ / (2π * a)] - [x₁ * λ / (2π * a)]`\n`Δθ = (x₂ - x₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe values for the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)` are well-known:\n*   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation for `Δθ`.\n\n`Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 3.1839 / (2 * π) * (λ / a)`\n\nTo find the numerical coefficient, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# Get the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function J1(x)\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nx1 = zeros[0]\nx2 = zeros[1]\n\n# Calculate the coefficient for the angular distance\n# delta_theta = coefficient * (lambda / a)\ncoefficient = (x2 - x1) / (2 * math.pi)\n\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n<execute_return>\n0.5067980016935041\n</execute_return>\nThe calculated coefficient is approximately `0.5068`.\n\nSo, the angular distance is:\n\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ / a\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe value `0.5068` is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "My reasoning process to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Geometry**: The problem describes an aperture shaped like an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length `a`. An apothem is the line segment from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, all apothems are indeed of the same length. The question asks for the result when N is infinitely large (N -> ∞). As the number of sides of a regular polygon with a fixed apothem increases infinitely, the polygon approaches a circle. The apothem `a` becomes the radius of this circle.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Phenomenon**: The problem describes monochromatic light passing through an aperture and forming an intensity pattern in the far-field region. This is a classic example of Fraunhofer diffraction. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\n3.  **Recall the Theory for Circular Aperture Diffraction**: The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern, which is given by the formula:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n    where:\n    *   `I(θ)` is the intensity at an angle `θ` from the central axis.\n    *   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center (`θ = 0`).\n    *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   `k` is the wave number, defined as `k = 2π / λ`, where `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n\n4.  **Determine the Condition for Minima**: The intensity minima (dark fringes) occur where the intensity `I(θ)` is zero. This happens when the numerator of the expression is zero, provided the denominator is not zero. Thus, the condition for a minimum is:\n    `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`\n    (excluding the case where the argument `k * a * sin(θ) = 0`, which corresponds to the central maximum).\n\n5.  **Find the Angular Positions of the Minima**: The minima correspond to the angles `θ_m` for which the argument of the Bessel function is a zero of `J₁(x)`. Let `u_m` be the m-th positive zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n    `k * a * sin(θ_m) = u_m`\n    Substituting `k = 2π / λ`, we get:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = u_m`\n    The problem states we can use the small-angle approximation, where `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. So:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = u_m`\n    Solving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n    `θ_m = u_m * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance**: We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   The first minimum (`m=1`) is at `θ₁ = u₁ * λ / (2π * a)`.\n    *   The second minimum (`m=2`) is at `θ₂ = u₂ * λ / (2π * a)`.\n    The angular distance is:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (u₂ * λ / (2π * a)) - (u₁ * λ / (2π * a))`\n    `Δθ = (u₂ - u₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Find the Numerical Values**: To get the final numerical coefficient, we need the values of the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. These are well-known mathematical constants.\n    *   `u₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   `u₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n    Now, we can compute the coefficient `(u₂ - u₁) / (2π)`. I will use a python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# The problem requires the angular distance between the first two minima.\n# The angular position of the m-th minimum is given by theta_m = u_m * lambda / (2 * pi * a),\n# where u_m is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J1(x).\n\n# We need the first two zeros of J1(x).\n# jn_zeros(1, 2) returns an array with the first two positive zeros of J1.\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nu1 = zeros[0]  # First zero\nu2 = zeros[1]  # Second zero\n\n# The angular distance is Delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1.\n# Delta_theta = (u2 - u1) / (2 * pi) * (lambda / a)\n# We need to calculate the coefficient (u2 - u1) / (2 * pi).\ncoefficient = (u2 - u1) / (2 * math.pi)\n\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n<execute_return>\n0.5067980016935041\n</execute_return>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately `0.5068`. The angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated coefficient is `0.5068`. Let's compare this to the given options:\n    A) 0.610\n    B) 1.220\n    C) 0.506\n    D) 0.500\n\nThe calculated value `0.5068` is extremely close to `0.506`. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
