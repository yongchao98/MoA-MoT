    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products of the given Michael addition reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (sodium ethoxide, NaOEt), the acidic α-proton (the proton on the carbon between the two carbonyl groups) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`. This is a soft nucleophile, perfect for Michael additions.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electron-deficient due to conjugation with the ester group, making it the site of nucleophilic attack. The p-tolyl group is -C₆H₄CH₃.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (1,4-Conjugate Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃` + `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` → `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n    *   The resulting intermediate is another enolate, which is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final stable product.\n    *   `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃` + `EtOH` → `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃` + `EtO⁻`\n\n3.  **Identify and Name the Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this molecule systemically as per the options, we identify the main carbon chain that includes the three ester functional groups.\n    *   The structure can be rewritten as `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃`.\n    *   Let's name this as a substituted propane-tricarboxylate. The propane chain is `C3-C2-C1`.\n        *   C1 has two methoxycarbonyl (`-COOCH₃`) groups.\n        *   C2 has a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3 has a methoxycarbonyl (`-COOCH₃`) group (from `-CH₂COOCH₃`).\n    *   Thus, the IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines serve as enolate equivalents in the Stork enamine alkylation, which is a type of Michael addition. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the original enone system, which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond and an intermediate iminium ion.\n    *   The subsequent acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`) has two functions:\n        1.  It protonates the intermediate enolate formed from the nitrile part.\n        2.  It hydrolyzes the iminium ion functional group back into a ketone.\n    *   The net result is the addition of a ` -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group to the α-position (C2) of the original cyclohexanone.\n\n3.  **Identify and Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. The substituent at C2 is derived from but-2-enenitrile and has the structure `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexanone.\n    *   To name this molecule, we treat the nitrile as the principal functional group. The main chain is a butanenitrile.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n        *   A 2-oxocyclohexyl group is attached at the C3 position of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. This is the stable keto-tautomer, which is the major product.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retro-Michael):**\n    *   We are given the product and the Michael acceptor, and we need to find the Michael donor (C). This requires a retrosynthetic (or \"retro-Michael\") analysis.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The main structure is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. At C2 (the acidic carbon between the two ketones), a `-(CH₂)₂-C(=O)CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) group is attached.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** KOH is a base that deprotonates the Michael donor to create the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Michael Donor (C):**\n    *   The Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   In our product, the donor part is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, and the `3-oxobutyl` side chain comes from the acceptor, MVK.\n    *   Let's verify this: The MVK molecule `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃` gets attacked at the β-carbon (the `CH₂` group) and the α-carbon gets protonated. This results in the fragment `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`, which is indeed the 3-oxobutyl group.\n    *   The C-C bond formed is between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be the molecule that, upon deprotonation by KOH, gives the nucleophile that attacks MVK. This molecule is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A, B, C)\n*   B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Correct A, B, C)\n*   C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A, B)\n*   D) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies all three species is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
