    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the initial conditions and conservation laws.**\n*   Initial state: A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is M*c² = 300 GeV. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Final state: The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses m1 and m2. Let's denote the more massive fragment as m2 and the lighter one as m1.\n*   Conservation of Energy: The total energy is conserved. The initial energy (M*c²) is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments (m1*c² + m2*c²) plus their kinetic energies (T1 + T2).\n*   Conservation of Momentum: The total momentum is conserved. Since the initial momentum is zero, the final fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let p1 and p2 be the momenta of the fragments, then **p1** = -**p2**, which means their magnitudes are equal: |**p1**| = |**p2**| = p.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest masses of the fragments.**\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: m2 = 2 * m1.\n*   We are also given that the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n*   We can treat masses as energies by setting c=1 (e.g., mass M corresponds to rest energy M). So, M = 300 GeV.\n*   Substitute m2 = 2*m1 into the second equation:\n    m1 + (2*m1) = 0.99 * M\n    3*m1 = 0.99 * M\n    m1 = 0.33 * M = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n*   Now find m2:\n    m2 = 2 * m1 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   The more massive fragment has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy (Q) is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy.\n*   Q = T_total = M*c² - (m1*c² + m2*c²)\n*   Q = M*c² - (0.99 * M*c²) = 0.01 * M*c²\n*   Q = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.\n*   So, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. (Here T1 refers to the kinetic energy of the massive fragment m2, as per the problem statement, and T2 is the kinetic energy of the lighter fragment m1).\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using classical (non-relativistic) mechanics.**\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by T = p² / (2m).\n*   Since the momenta are equal (p1 = p2 = p):\n    *   T_light (T2) = p² / (2*m1)\n    *   T_massive (T1) = p² / (2*m2)\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    *   T_light / T_massive = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 198 / 99 = 2.\n    *   So, T_light = 2 * T_massive.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy:\n    *   T_light + T_massive = 3 GeV\n    *   (2 * T_massive) + T_massive = 3 GeV\n    *   3 * T_massive = 3 GeV\n    *   T_massive = 1 GeV.\n*   So, the classical approximation for T1 is **T1_classical = 1 GeV**.\n\n**5. Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using relativistic mechanics.**\n*   The relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\n*   The total energy is also E = T + m*c², where T is the kinetic energy.\n*   Substituting E, we get (T + m*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)², which simplifies to (p*c)² = T² + 2*T*m*c² = T(T + 2*m*c²).\n*   Since the momenta are equal (p_light = p_massive), we have:\n    *   T_light * (T_light + 2*m1*c²) = T_massive * (T_massive + 2*m2*c²)\n*   Let's substitute the known values (T_massive = T1, T_light = 3 - T1, m1=99 GeV, m2=198 GeV):\n    *   (3 - T1) * ( (3 - T1) + 2 * 99) = T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198)\n    *   (3 - T1) * (201 - T1) = T1 * (T1 + 396)\n    *   603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1² = T1² + 396*T1\n    *   603 - 204*T1 = 396*T1\n    *   603 = (396 + 204) * T1\n    *   603 = 600 * T1\n    *   T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV.\n*   So, the correct relativistic value for T1 is **T1_correct = 1.005 GeV**.\n\n**6. Find the difference.**\n*   The difference is ΔT1 = T1_correct - T1_classical.\n*   ΔT1 = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV. We use the conversion 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n*   ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
