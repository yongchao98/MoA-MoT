    "An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighs 7.20 g. Upon heating to 200°C, it decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. No solid residue remains. The resulting gases are analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n**1. Analysis of the gaseous products:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong dehydrating agent that absorbs water.\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition. This rules out salts containing carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or sulfite (SO₃²⁻) that would produce CO₂ or SO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, which means the weight increase is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   The mass increase is 0.80 g. This is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from molecular oxygen (O₂) or another oxygen-containing compound that reacts with hot copper, like nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remain. The volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents used (Mg(ClO₄)₂, Ca(OH)₂, hot Cu), which strongly suggests it is dinitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Deducing the identity of salts A and B:**\n\nFrom the products, the original salts must contain Hydrogen (from H₂O), Nitrogen (from Gas C, N₂), and Oxygen (from H₂O and the reaction with Cu). Since they are salts and decompose to produce N₂ and H₂O, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxoanions. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the salts are **A = NH₄NO₃** and **B = NH₄NO₂**.\nThe mixture is equimolar, so let's assume it contains `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\nThe decomposition reactions at ~200°C are:\n*   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nSo, from the decomposition of `n` moles of each salt, the total gaseous products are:\n*   `n` moles of N₂O\n*   `n` moles of N₂\n*   `2n + 2n = 4n` moles of H₂O\n\nNow, let's trace these gases through the tubes:\n\n*   **Tube №1:** Absorbs all `4n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   We know 0.20 mol of H₂O was absorbed. So, `4n = 0.20 mol` ⇒ `n = 0.05 mol`.\n\nThis means the initial mixture contained **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃** and **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂**. Let's verify this with the other data points.\n\n*   **Total Mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This perfectly matches the given initial mass.\n\n*   **Tube №3:** After passing through tubes 1 and 2, the gas mixture contains `n = 0.05` mol N₂ and `n = 0.05` mol N₂O. Hot copper does not react with N₂, but it reacts with N₂O:\n    *   N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO\n    *   `0.05` mol of N₂O will react, depositing `0.05` mol of oxygen atoms onto the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   This perfectly matches the mass increase of tube №3.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** The gas leaving tube №3 consists of the initial N₂ plus the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction.\n    *   Initial N₂ = `n` = 0.05 mol.\n    *   N₂ from N₂O reaction = `n` = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of final gas = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This perfectly matches the moles of gas C calculated from its volume.\n\nThe hypothesis is fully confirmed. Salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**3. Calculating the total number of atoms:**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms in both salts = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
