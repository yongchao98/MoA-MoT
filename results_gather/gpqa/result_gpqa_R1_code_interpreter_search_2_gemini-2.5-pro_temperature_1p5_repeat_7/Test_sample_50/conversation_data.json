    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Method of Images\n\nThe problem asks for the potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a nearby grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere has its potential fixed at zero (V=0).\n\nThis type of electrostatics problem is elegantly solved using the **Method of Images**. The core idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conductor with one or more fictitious \"image charges\". These image charges are placed inside the region originally occupied by the conductor. Their positions and magnitudes are chosen such that they, along with the original external charge(s), produce the correct potential (in this case, V=0) on the boundary surface (the sphere's surface). For any point outside the conductor, the electric field and potential are the same in both the real and the image-charge scenarios.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)\n\nLet the sphere have a radius `R` and be centered at the origin. The point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center along, say, the x-axis. We need to find an image charge `q'` at a position `b` (also on the x-axis) inside the sphere such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\nThe potential `V` at an arbitrary point `P` on the surface of the sphere is the sum of the potentials from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n*   `V(P) = V_q + V_{q'} = 0`\n*   `k*q / (distance from q to P) + k*q' / (distance from q' to P) = 0`\n\nThrough a standard derivation (which involves ensuring the potential is zero for all points on the sphere), the image charge is found to have the following properties:\n\n*   **Position of image charge (b):** The image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, on the same line as the original charge `q`.\n*   **Magnitude of image charge (q'):** The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite polarity to the original charge, which is necessary to create an attractive force and cancel the potential on the surface.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy (U)\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nThere is a standard formula for the potential energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Î£ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges in the system.\n\nIn our case, the system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the grounded sphere.\n\n1.  **Contribution from the sphere:** The sphere is a conductor held at `V=0`. Its contribution to the energy formula is `(1/2) * Q_induced * V_sphere = (1/2) * Q_induced * 0 = 0`.\n2.  **Contribution from the point charge `q`:** The contribution is `(1/2) * q * V_q`, where `V_q` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charge on the sphere.\n\nSo, the total potential energy is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nNow, we use the method of images. The potential created by the induced surface charge at any point outside the sphere is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. Therefore, we can find `V_induced` at the position of `q` by calculating the potential created by `q'` at that point.\n\n*   Position of charge `q`: `d` from the center.\n*   Position of image charge `q'`: `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n\nThe potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * (-q * R/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * (-q * R/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * q * R * d / (d * (d^2 - R^2))`\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nFinally, substitute this potential back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
