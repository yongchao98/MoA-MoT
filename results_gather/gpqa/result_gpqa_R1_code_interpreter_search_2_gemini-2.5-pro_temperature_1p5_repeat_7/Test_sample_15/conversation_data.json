    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess the chirality of each molecule. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks an improper axis of rotation, which includes elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The double bond and its substituents lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry (σ).\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The IUPAC name includes stereodescriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound has defined absolute configurations at specific chiral centers (the bridgehead atoms 3a and 7a).\n    *   By naming a specific stereoisomer with R/S configurations, it implies that we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   The molecule is complex and lacks any obvious symmetry elements that would make it a meso compound. The presence of the `(E)-chloromethylene` group further reduces the likelihood of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The given stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. Let's examine its structure. We can draw a Fischer projection or a Newman projection.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n        H ----|---- CH3   (This has S-configuration for C2)\n      CH3 ----|---- H     (This has R-configuration for C3)\n              |\n            COOH\n        ```\n    Let's draw the (2R,3S) isomer correctly.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n      CH3 ----|---- H     (R at C2)\n        H ----|---- CH3   (S at C3)\n              |\n            COOH\n        ```\n    *   In this configuration, there is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   A compound with chiral centers but also a plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a different stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   Its structure lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) stereoisomer, and they are not superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is a chiral molecule (one of a pair of enantiomers). As a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) -CH2-CH=, and (4) -CH=CH-CH2- (going the other way around the ring). The two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The `(1s,3s,5s)` designation refers to the all-`cis` isomer, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (e.g., all pointing \"up\" from the average plane of the ring).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   Since it has planes of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Let's check C3 of the butane chain, which is `CH(CH3)`. It is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group, and two methyl groups (`-CH3`).\n    *   Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, C3 is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The cyclopentyl ring is unsubstituted, and all other non-carbonyl carbons have at least two identical substituents (hydrogens).\n    *   The molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are those that are chiral:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>"
