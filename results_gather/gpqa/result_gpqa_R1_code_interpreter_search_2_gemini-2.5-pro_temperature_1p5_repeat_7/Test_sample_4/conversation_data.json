    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the components of the operator**\n\nThe problem provides the Cartesian components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$:\n- $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n- $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n- $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThese are the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle (like a muon), where $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.\n\n**2. Define the direction vector**\n\nThe operator is to be evaluated along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A general unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in 3D spherical coordinates is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\nSince the vector lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. This implies $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$, which is satisfied if $\\phi=0$ (or $\\phi=\\pi$). We choose $\\phi=0$ without loss of generality.\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is therefore:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\nHere, $\\theta$ is the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n**3. Construct the operator along the direction** $\\vec{n}$\n\nThe operator representing the spin projection along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n\nNow, substitute the matrix forms of $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set up and solve the eigenvalue equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nLet the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation yields a system of two linear equations:\n1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b\\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis means $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a\\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nTo simplify, we can choose a convenient value for the constant $a$. Let $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$. Then $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nSo, the unnormalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Normalize the eigenvector**\n\nThe norm-squared of the eigenvector must be 1: $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^* \\cos(\\theta/2) + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^* \\sin(\\theta/2)$\nSince $\\theta$ is real, the components are real:\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n\nThe vector is already normalized. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**6. Compare with the given options**\n\nComparing our result with the options provided:\nA) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - This matches our result.\nB) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect form and includes $\\hbar$.\nC) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect arguments for the trigonometric functions.\nD) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect form and includes $\\hbar$.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
