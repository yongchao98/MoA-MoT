    "The user is asking to identify a biological process based on a set of experimental observations.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup and observations:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus (a common gut pathogen), tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, mimicking a natural route of infection.\n    *   **Location:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, crucial for initiating mucosal immunity. The fluorescence is observed here, indicating the antigen has reached its target site for an immune response.\n    *   **Cell population:** Proliferating cells are isolated. In a secondary lymphoid organ, after antigen presentation, B cells and T cells proliferate. The subsequent finding of a variable heavy chain gene points specifically to B cells. This proliferation occurs in a specialized structure called a germinal center.\n    *   **Key finding:** Sequencing the *variable heavy chain gene* reveals *high variability*. The variable region of an antibody is what binds to the antigen.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the possible processes:**\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA). It determines the antibody's function and location but does *not* alter the *variable* region or its diversity. Therefore, this is not the primary cause of the observed variability in the variable gene.\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially creates the diverse repertoire of B cell receptors. It happens in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in a *secondary* lymphoid organ in response to a specific antigen, involving already-matured B cells. Therefore, VDJ recombination has already occurred and is not the process taking place now.\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is part of the innate immune system, involving a cascade of serum proteins. It does not involve genetic modifications to B cell receptors and is unrelated to the variability of the heavy chain gene.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs specifically in activated B cells proliferating within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the DNA sequences encoding the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This generates variants of the original B cell receptor, and cells producing higher-affinity receptors are selected to survive and differentiate. This process directly results in \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating B cell population, with the goal of affinity maturation.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch with high variability in their variable heavy chain gene is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation occurring within a germinal center reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
