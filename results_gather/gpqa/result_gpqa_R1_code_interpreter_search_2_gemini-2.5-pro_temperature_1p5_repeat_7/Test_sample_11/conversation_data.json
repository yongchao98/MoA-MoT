    "This problem involves a two-body decay of a stationary particle. We can solve it by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the framework of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principles and Given Information\n\n*   **Decay Reaction:** π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n*   **Initial State:** The positive pion (π⁺) is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero, and its initial energy is purely its rest mass energy.\n    *   Initial Energy (E_initial) = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Initial Momentum (p_initial) = 0\n*   **Final State:** The products are a positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). They move off with some kinetic energy.\n*   **Given Rest Energies:**\n    *   Rest energy of π⁺ (m_π * c²): 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of μ⁺ (m_μ * c²): 105.7 MeV\n*   **Assumption:** The neutrino (ν) is treated as a massless particle, which is a standard and accurate approximation for this type of problem. So, its rest mass m_ν = 0.\n\n### 2. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   p_μ = -p_ν\n*   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay equals the total energy after the decay.\n*   E_initial = E_final\n*   m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\nWhere:\n*   E_μ is the total energy of the muon (rest energy + kinetic energy).\n*   E_ν is the total energy of the neutrino. Since it's massless, its energy is purely kinetic and is related to its momentum by E_ν = p*c.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Kinetic Energies\n\nWe can derive a general formula for the energies of the decay products. From the conservation laws, it can be shown that the total energy of the muon (E_μ) is given by:\n\nE_μ = [ (m_π * c²)² + (m_μ * c²)² - (m_ν * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_π * c²) ]\n\nSince we assume the neutrino is massless (m_ν * c² = 0), the formula simplifies to:\n\nE_μ = [ (m_π * c²)² + (m_μ * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_π * c²) ]\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n\nKE_μ = E_μ - (m_μ * c²)\n\nThe total kinetic energy released in the decay (also called the Q-value) is the difference in the initial and final rest masses:\n\nQ = (m_π * c²) - (m_μ * c²) - (m_ν * c²) = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 0 = 33.9 MeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two product particles:\n\nQ = KE_μ + KE_ν\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is:\n\nKE_ν = Q - KE_μ\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nWe can now use these formulas to calculate the kinetic energies. We'll use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Rest energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total kinetic energy (Q-value)\nQ_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\nKE_nu = Q_value - KE_mu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe execution of the above code will yield the following output:\n```text\nKinetic energy of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic energy of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n```\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon (μ⁺) ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (ν) ≈ 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78)\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Principles:**\n\nThe solution relies on two fundamental principles of physics applied in the context of special relativity:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the product particles must also be zero. This implies they fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n\n**2. Setup:**\n\n*   **Reaction:** π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Energy: E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV (since it's at rest)\n    *   Momentum: p_initial = 0\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Energy: E_final = E_μ + E_ν (where E_μ and E_ν are the total energies of the muon and neutrino)\n    *   Momentum: p_final = p_μ + p_ν\n*   **Given Masses:**\n    *   Rest energy of π⁺ (m_π * c²): 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of μ⁺ (m_μ * c²): 105.7 MeV\n    *   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless (m_ν * c² = 0).\n\n**3. Derivations:**\n\nFrom conservation of momentum, |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\nFrom conservation of energy, m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν.\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²:\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν): E_ν = p*c\n\nSubstituting `p*c = E_ν` into the muon's energy equation:\nE_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n\nFrom energy conservation, we have E_ν = m_π * c² - E_μ. Substituting this in:\nE_μ² = (m_π * c² - E_μ)² + (m_μ * c²)²\nE_μ² = (m_π * c²)² - 2(m_π * c²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μ * c²)²\n\nSimplifying the equation to solve for the total energy of the muon (E_μ):\n2(m_π * c²)E_μ = (m_π * c²)² + (m_μ * c²)²\nE_μ = [ (m_π * c²)² + (m_μ * c²)² ] / [ 2 * m_π * c² ]\n\n**4. Calculation:**\n\nThe Python code executed in the thinking process performs this calculation:\n*   It first calculates the total energy of the muon (E_μ).\n*   Then it finds the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) using the formula: KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ * c².\n*   Finally, it finds the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν). The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is `m_π * c² - m_μ * c²`. This energy is shared between the two particles, so `KE_ν = Q_value - KE_μ`.\n\nThe results from the code are:\n*   Kinetic energy of muon (μ⁺): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic energy of neutrino (ν): **29.78 MeV** (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon and the neutrino are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
