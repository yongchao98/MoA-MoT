    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Model\n\nThe problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. The energy levels of such a molecule are given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy:** `Ev = ħω(v + 1/2)`, where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **Rotational Energy:** `Er = B * J(J + 1)`, where `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), and `B = ħ² / (2I)` is the rotational constant. `I` is the moment of inertia.\n*   **Total Energy:** `E_v,J = ħω(v + 1/2) + B * J(J + 1)`.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State (Fundamental State):** This is the ground state, which has the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   `E_initial = E_0,0 = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n*   **Final State (\"Next state with the lowest possible energy\"):** This requires careful interpretation. A molecule absorbs a photon, causing a transition. The rules governing these transitions are called selection rules. For a single-photon absorption in a typical diatomic molecule:\n    *   The vibrational quantum number must change by `Δv = +1`.\n    *   The rotational quantum number must change by `ΔJ = ±1`.\n\n    Starting from the ground state `(v=0, J=0)`, the allowed transitions are:\n    *   `Δv = +1`: The molecule must move to the `v = 1` vibrational level.\n    *   `ΔJ = +1` (since `J` cannot be negative): The molecule must move to the `J = 1` rotational level.\n    \n    A transition with `ΔJ = 0` (the Q-branch) is forbidden for most diatomic molecules during infrared absorption. A pure rotational transition (`Δv = 0`) is also possible, but it requires a much lower energy photon (in the microwave range) and the calculated momentum would not match any of the options provided. The options point towards a higher-energy rovibrational transition.\n\n    Therefore, the transition is from `(v=0, J=0)` to `(v=1, J=1)`. This is the lowest-energy rovibrational transition possible from the ground state.\n\n    *   `E_final = E_1,1 = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Photon Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n*   `ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]`\n*   `ΔE = ħω + 2B`\n\nNow, we need to calculate the values of `ħω` and `2B`.\n\n*   `2B = ħ² / I`, where `I = μR²`.\n*   `μ` is the reduced mass: `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\nLet's plug in the given values. It's most efficient and accurate to do this with a single computation.\n\n*   `Mx` = 20 amu\n*   `My` = 2 amu\n*   `R` = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   `ω` = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   `ħ` (reduced Planck's constant) ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 2.99792 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\nThe following Python script will perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nMx_amu = 20.0  # mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # mass of atom Y in amu\nR = 2.0e-10      # molecular bond length in meters\nw = 4.0e14       # angular frequency of vibration in rad/s\n\n# Physical constants\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27  # kg/amu\nh_bar = 1.054571e-34      # J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8          # m/s\n\n# 1. Calculate reduced mass (mu) in kg\nmu_amu = (Mx_amu * My_amu) / (Mx_amu + My_amu)\nmu_kg = mu_amu * amu_to_kg\n\n# 2. Calculate moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu_kg * R**2\n\n# 3. Calculate the rotational term (2B = h_bar^2 / I)\ntwo_B = (h_bar**2) / I\n\n# 4. Calculate the vibrational energy term (h_bar * w)\nvib_energy_term = h_bar * w\n\n# 5. Calculate the total transition energy (Delta_E)\n# For the transition (v=0, J=0) -> (v=1, J=1), Delta_E = h_bar*w + 2B\ndelta_E = vib_energy_term + two_B\n\n# 6. Calculate the photon's momentum (p = Delta_E / c)\np = delta_E / c\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{p:.2e}\")\n```\n\n### 5. Final Result\n\nThe code calculates the momentum `p`. The photon's energy `E_photon` is `ΔE`, and its momentum `p` is related by `p = E_photon / c`.\n\nThe script output is:\n`1.41e-28`\n\nThis value is `1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states of the molecule. The energy levels of a quantum rotation-vibration system are given by:\n\n`E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J + 1)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, `B = ħ² / (2I)`.\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia, `I = μR²`.\n*   `μ` is the reduced mass, `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n\nThe **initial state** is the fundamental state (ground state), where `v = 0` and `J = 0`:\n`E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\nFor a single photon absorption, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`. To get to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" from the ground state `J=0`, the only allowed rotational transition is `ΔJ = +1`. Thus, the **final state** is `v = 1` and `J = 1`:\n`E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon, `ΔE`, is the difference between these two states:\n`ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = ħω + 2B`\n\nThe momentum of a photon (`p`) is related to its energy by `p = ΔE / c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n`p = (ħω + 2B) / c`\n\nWe can substitute `2B = ħ² / I = ħ² / (μR²)` into the equation:\n`p = ( ħω + ħ² / (μR²) ) / c`\n\nThe python code calculated all these values:\n1.  Reduced mass `μ` from the atomic masses `Mx` and `My`.\n2.  Moment of inertia `I` from `μ` and the bond length `R`.\n3.  The transition energy `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`.\n4.  The photon momentum `p = ΔE / c`.\n\nThe code output was `1.41e-28`, which corresponds to `1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`. Comparing this to the options:\n\nA) `p = 1.1*10⁻²⁷ N*s`\nB) `p = 1.4*10⁻²⁸ N*s`\nC) `p = 2.3*10⁻²⁷ N*s`\nD) `p = 1.9*10⁻²⁸ N*s`\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
