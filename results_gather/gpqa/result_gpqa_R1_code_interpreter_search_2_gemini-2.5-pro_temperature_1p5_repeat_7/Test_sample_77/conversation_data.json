    "1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a classic problem in electromagnetism, and the solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are fundamental because they are exact solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\n2.  **Define the variables and the coordinate system:**\n    *   `q`: The electric charge of the point particle.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`. This is the trajectory.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (the \"field point\").\n    *   `t`: The time at which the potentials are measured at point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   `tr`: The \"retarded time\". Because electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed `c`, the potentials at `(r, t)` are determined not by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time `tr`. This is the time when the \"news\" from the charge had to leave to reach point `r` at time `t`.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `tr` to the observation point `r`. Mathematically, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$. Let `d = |\\vec{d}|` be its magnitude.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`. Mathematically, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}|_{t'=tr}$.\n    *   `c`, $\\epsilon_o$, $\\mu_o$: Speed of light in vacuum, permittivity of free space, and permeability of free space, respectively.\n\n3.  **Establish the retarded time condition:**\n    The time it takes for the field to travel from the charge's retarded position $\\vec{s}(tr)$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is the distance `d` divided by the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the observation time `t` is related to the retarded time `tr` by:\n    $t = tr + \\frac{d}{c}$ or $t - tr = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c}$\n    This is an implicit equation for `tr`, as `s(tr)` itself depends on `tr`.\n\n4.  **State the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:**\n    The potentials are derived from the general retarded potential formulas for continuous distributions by applying them to a point charge. The standard results are:\n    Scalar potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{tr}$\n    Vector potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{tr}$\n    The subscript `tr` indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `d`, `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n5.  **Manipulate the formulas to match the given options:**\n    Let's focus on the denominator term: $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n    We can rewrite this by finding a common denominator `c`:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    Now, substitute this back into the expressions for V and A:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\left(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\left(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the provided options:**\n    *   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect. This uses the static potential form and ignores retardation.\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the relativistic Doppler-like effect on the fields.\n    *   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect. Again, this uses the static form for V. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
