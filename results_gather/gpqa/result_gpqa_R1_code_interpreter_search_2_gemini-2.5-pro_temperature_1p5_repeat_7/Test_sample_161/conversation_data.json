    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Metric and Area Element**\n\nThe given metric is:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a metric on a 2-dimensional surface described by coordinates $(x, y)$. The metric can be written in the form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$.\nBy comparing with the given expression, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$:\n$g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nThe area element $dA$ for a given metric is calculated as $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$, where $g$ is the matrix of the metric tensor:\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx} & g_{xy} \\\\ g_{yx} & g_{yy} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of the metric tensor is:\n$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2 - 0 = \\frac{32^2}{(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^2}$\n\nThe square root of the determinant is:\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{32^2}{(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^2}} = \\frac{32}{|4-x^{2}-y^{2}|}$\n\n**2. Determine the Domain of Integration**\n\nThe metric is defined only where the denominator $4-x^2-y^2$ is not zero. For a Riemannian metric with positive definite $g_{ij}$, we must have $4-x^2-y^2 > 0$. This defines the domain of our surface:\n$x^2+y^2 < 4$\nThis is an open disk of radius 2 centered at the origin. The phrase \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" in the question refers to this domain. Inside this disk, $4-x^2-y^2 > 0$, so the absolute value is not needed.\n\nThe area element is:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**3. Set up the Area Integral**\n\nThe total area is the integral of the area element $dA$ over the entire domain $D = \\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$:\n$Area = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nTo evaluate this integral, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates:\n$x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n$y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\nThis implies $x^2+y^2 = \\rho^2$.\nThe Jacobian for the transformation gives $dx\\,dy = \\rho\\,d\\rho\\,d\\theta$.\n\nThe domain of integration in polar coordinates becomes:\n$0 \\le \\rho < 2$\n$0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$\n\nSubstituting these into the area integral, we get:\n$Area = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4 - \\rho^2} \\, \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nWe can separate the integral into angular and radial parts:\n$Area = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32 \\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} \\, d\\rho\\right)$\n$Area = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32 \\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n\nThe radial integral is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ goes to infinity as $\\rho \\to 2$. We evaluate it using a limit:\n$I_\\rho = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32 \\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} \\, d\\rho = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{32 \\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n\nWe use the substitution $u = 4 - \\rho^2$, which gives $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, or $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2}du$.\nThe indefinite integral is:\n$\\int \\frac{32 \\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} \\, d\\rho = \\int \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}du\\right) = -16 \\int \\frac{1}{u} du = -16 \\ln|u| = -16 \\ln(4 - \\rho^2)$ (since $4-\\rho^2 > 0$)\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n$I_\\rho = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left[-16 \\ln(4 - \\rho^2)\\right]_{0}^{a}$\n$I_\\rho = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 \\ln(4 - a^2) - (-16 \\ln(4 - 0^2)) \\right)$\n$I_\\rho = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 \\ln(4 - a^2) + 16 \\ln(4) \\right)$\n\nAs $a \\to 2^-$, the term $4 - a^2$ approaches $0^+$. Therefore, $\\ln(4 - a^2)$ approaches $-\\infty$.\nSo, the limit becomes:\n$I_\\rho = -16(-\\infty) + 16 \\ln(4) = +\\infty$\n\nThe radial integral diverges to infinity.\n\nThe total area is:\n$Area = 2\\pi \\times I_\\rho = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe area of the surface described by the given metric is infinite.\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 0\nB) $+\\infty$\nC) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)$\nD) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)$\n\nOptions C and D are functions of coordinates, but the area of the entire surface must be a constant value (a scalar). So, C and D are incorrect.\nOption A is incorrect because the area element $\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$ is strictly positive over the entire domain of integration, so the area cannot be zero.\nThis leaves Option B, which matches our calculation.\n\nThe area is $+\\infty$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
