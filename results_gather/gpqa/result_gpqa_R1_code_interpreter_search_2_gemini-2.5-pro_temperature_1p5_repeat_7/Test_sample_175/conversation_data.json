    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   The initial (unnormalized) state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ_unnormalized⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   The operator P is given by the matrix:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The operator Q is given by the matrix:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the state vector `|ψ⟩`. The squared norm is the sum of the squares of its elements:\n`⟨ψ_unnormalized|ψ_unnormalized⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`.\nThe normalized state vector is:\n`|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n**3. Measurement of P: Probability of getting the eigenvalue 0**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of measuring the value 0 for the observable P. According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator. The probability of measuring a certain eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P**: We need to solve the characteristic equation `det(P - pI) = 0` for the eigenvalues `p`.\n    ```\n    det([[ -p, 1/√2,   0   ],\n         [1/√2,  -p,  1/√2],\n         [  0,  1/√2,  -p  ]]) = 0\n    ```\n    This simplifies to `-p(p² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-p/√2) = 0`, which gives `-p³ + p/2 + p/2 = 0`, or `p(1 - p²) = 0`.\n    The eigenvalues of P are `p = 0, 1, -1`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for p = 0**: We need to find the vector `|p₀⟩` such that `P|p₀⟩ = 0 * |p₀⟩`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the equations:\n    1.  `y/√2 = 0  => y = 0`\n    2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0  => x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. Normalizing this vector: `x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1 => 2x² = 1 => x = 1/√2`.\n    So, the normalized eigenvector for `p=0` is `|p₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0**:\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ⟩|²`\n    `⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] . (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n    `= (1/√12) * ((1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1))`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n**4. State Collapse after Measuring P**\n\nWhen the measurement of P yields the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|p₀⟩`.\nThe new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`\n\n**5. Measurement of Q: Probability of getting the eigenvalue -1**\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Q**: Q is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `q = 1, 0, -1`.\n*   The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `q=-1` is `|q₋₁⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1**: This probability is calculated on the collapsed state `|ψ'⟩`.\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] . [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`\n    `= (0)*(1/√2) + (0)*(0) + (1)*(-1/√2) = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n**6. Calculate the Joint Probability**\n\nThe probability of first measuring `P=0` and then measuring `Q=-1` is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | state after P=0)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
