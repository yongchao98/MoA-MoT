    "This question asks for the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation for space-charge-limited current (SCLC) is valid. Let's break down the equation and the physical model behind it.\n\n**The Mott-Gurney Model Derivation Assumptions:**\n\n1.  **Current Mechanism:** The current is due to charge carriers injected into a semiconductor (or insulator). The intrinsic carrier concentration is assumed to be negligible. The current is limited not by the injection process itself, but by the electrostatic repulsion of the injected carriers, which forms a \"space charge\".\n\n2.  **Carrier Type:** The model simplifies the situation by assuming only one type of carrier is mobile and contributes to the current. Therefore, it is a **single-carrier device** model. This rules out option D, which specifies a two-carrier device where electron-hole recombination would also play a role.\n\n3.  **Contacts:** For a space charge to form, charge carriers must be easily injected from the contact into the device. This requires a contact with no (or a negligible) energy barrier for injection. This type of contact is called an **Ohmic contact**. A Schottky contact, by definition, has an energy barrier and would limit the current by thermionic emission over the barrier, not by space-charge effects within the bulk material. This rules out option A. The phrase \"no carrier injection barrier\" is another way of describing an ideal Ohmic contact.\n\n4.  **Material Properties:** The simplest form of the Mott-Gurney equation, $J \\propto V^2$, assumes that the injected carriers are free to move and are not immobilized. This means the material is assumed to be **trap-free**. If traps are present, they capture some of the injected charge, and the J-V relationship becomes more complex (often described by a trap-limited SCLC model) until all the traps are filled.\n\n5.  **Transport Mechanism:** The model assumes that the injected carriers move under the influence of the applied electric field. This is **drift current**. The current due to random thermal motion and concentration gradients (**diffusion current**) is assumed to be negligible. This assumption is valid when the applied voltage is much larger than the thermal voltage (V >> kT/q). This rules out option C, which incorrectly states that the *drift* current is negligible. In fact, the SCLC is fundamentally a drift-dominated current.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   Incorrect. It requires an Ohmic contact, not a Schottky contact, for efficient carrier injection.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   Correct. This statement accurately summarizes all the key assumptions:\n        *   `trap-free`: Yes, this is required for the simple V^2 law.\n        *   `single-carrier device`: Yes, recombination is ignored.\n        *   `no carrier injection barrier`: Yes, this is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact needed for injection.\n        *   `negligible diffusion current`: Yes, the current is assumed to be drift-dominated.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   Incorrect. The current is fundamentally a *drift* current. Stating that drift current is negligible is the opposite of the physical reality of the SCLC regime.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   Incorrect. The standard Mott-Gurney law is a single-carrier model. A two-carrier model would need to account for recombination.\n\nTherefore, option B is the only one that correctly lists the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
