    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe problem involves relativistic speeds, so we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since both are moving in the same direction (positive x-direction), we use the velocity subtraction formula.\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$) of object 1 with respect to object 2 is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   Speed of the first astronaut, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Speed of the second astronaut, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nPlug the values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two individual astronauts. The total energy ($E$) of a single particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma mc^2$\n\nWhere:\n*   $m$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass, $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Speed, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate the energy of the first astronaut, $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass, $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Speed, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n\nNow, calculate the energy of the second astronaut, $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total System Energy:**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed, $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Total energy, $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
