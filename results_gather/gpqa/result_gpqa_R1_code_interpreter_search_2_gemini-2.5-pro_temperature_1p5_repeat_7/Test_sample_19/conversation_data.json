    "This question asks to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of this approximation and evaluate each statement.\n\nThe core idea of the **impulse approximation** is that a high-energy interaction with a nucleus happens so quickly that it can be treated as an interaction with a single, momentarily free nucleon. The other nucleons are considered mere \"spectators.\"\n\nLet's analyze each assumption in this context:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is a foundational element of the impulse approximation. It explicitly neglects more complex phenomena like meson-exchange currents, where the interaction involves multiple nucleons simultaneously. This assumption simplifies the problem to a \"one-body\" interaction, which is essential for treating the target as a single nucleon. This statement is **correct**.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This addresses what happens *after* the primary interaction. If the nucleus is \"transparent,\" it means the struck nucleon (and any other particle produced) exits the nucleus without any further interactions with the remaining nucleons. This is known as the neglect of **Final State Interactions (FSI)**. While sometimes considered a separate, additional approximation (leading to the \"Plane Wave Impulse Approximation\" or PWIA), it is fundamentally tied to the ideal of treating the nucleon as if it were isolated. This statement is **correct** in the context of the most common and simple form of the impulse approximation.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This assumption concerns the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself, describing it as a composite of non-relativistic quarks. This is a feature of certain models, like the Non-Relativistic Quark Model (NRQM). However, the impulse approximation is a more general concept that deals with the nucleon's behavior *within the nucleus*, not its internal composition. One can use the impulse approximation in conjunction with fully relativistic descriptions of the nucleon (e.g., using parton distribution functions). Therefore, this is a separate, independent approximation and is **not** a defining feature of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The name implies the interaction time is infinitesimally short. During this brief instant, the nucleon does not have time to interact with the surrounding nuclear potential that binds it to the nucleus. It is treated as \"off-shell\" but otherwise free from the binding potential during the scattering event. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe impulse approximation is defined by the assumptions that the interaction is with a single nucleon (1), that this nucleon is free from its binding potential during the interaction (4), and that it leaves the nucleus without further interaction (2). Assumption (3) is an unrelated approximation about the internal structure of the nucleon.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
