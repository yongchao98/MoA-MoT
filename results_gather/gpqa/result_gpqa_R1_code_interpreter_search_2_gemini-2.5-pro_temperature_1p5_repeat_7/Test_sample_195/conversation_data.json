    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the System and its Energy:**\n    The system consists of a mass `m` attached to a \"relativistic spring\". The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy stored in the spring when the mass is at position `x` from the equilibrium is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n2.  **Relativistic Energy of the Particle:**\n    In special relativity, the total energy of a particle with rest mass `m` moving with velocity `v` is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    This total energy includes the rest mass energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = E_{particle} - mc^2 = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$).\n\n3.  **Conservation of Total System Energy:**\n    The total energy of the oscillator system, which is conserved, is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring.\n    $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    This total energy remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Energy at Key Points of the Motion:**\n\n    *   **At the point of maximum amplitude (turning point):**\n        The mass reaches its maximum displacement, $x = A$. At this point, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n        When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2}} = 1$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position:**\n        The mass passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The speed of the mass is maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$.\n        The total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy at the turning point must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$):**\n    First, solve the energy equation for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - (v_{max}/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate $(v_{max}/c)^2$:\n        $(v_{max}/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Take the square root of both sides and multiply by $c$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This expression matches option D.\n\n    *   Option A is incorrect due to the signs and structure.\n    *   Option B, $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$, is the classical (non-relativistic) result, which can be obtained by assuming $c \\to \\infty$ in our relativistic result.\n    *   Option C is incorrect due to the signs and a missing $c^2$ factor.\n\n<<<D>>>"
