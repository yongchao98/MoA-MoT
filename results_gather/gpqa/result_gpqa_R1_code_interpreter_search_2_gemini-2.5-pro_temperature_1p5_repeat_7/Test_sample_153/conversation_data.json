    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator of the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's check the molecular weights of the options:\nThe chemical formula for all four options (A, B, C, D) is C₇H₅ClO₂.\nMolecular Weight = (7 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (1 × 35.45) + (2 × 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol.\nAll four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that results from the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to the formation of dimers.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the carbonyl region and corresponds to a C=O stretch. The position is consistent with a carbonyl in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This makes options B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates and rules out option A (an aldehyde with a phenol) and option C (a chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group and would have a C=O stretch at a higher frequency).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (11.0 ppm):** This highly deshielded signal is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** It has no adjacent protons, which is expected for a -COOH proton.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** It corresponds to a single proton.\n    *   This confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (Aromatic Region):** Both signals are in the region typical for protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Integration (2H each):** This indicates two sets of two equivalent protons, for a total of four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In this pattern, the two protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent and are split by the protons at 3 and 5. Likewise, the protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent and are split by the protons at 2 and 6.\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\n*   **From MS:** The molecule has one chlorine atom and a MW of ~156.\n*   **From IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **From ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid proton and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\nLet's evaluate the final candidates based on the NMR aromatic pattern:\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement on a benzene ring. This structure would produce the exact ¹H NMR pattern observed: one downfield singlet for the acid proton and two doublets (each for 2H) in the aromatic region. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be the more deshielded doublet (8.02 ppm), and the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be the slightly less deshielded doublet (7.72 ppm). This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). It would have four non-equivalent aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (likely four separate multiplets), not two simple doublets. This is inconsistent with the ¹H NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the provided spectral information is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
