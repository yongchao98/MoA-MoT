    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts**\n    *   **Mean Free Path (MFP), λ:** This is the average distance a particle travels between consecutive collisions.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section, σ:** This is the effective \"target area\" a particle presents for a collision. A larger cross-section means a higher probability of collision.\n    *   **Relationship:** The mean free path is inversely proportional to both the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ). The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ).\n\n2.  **Define the Two Scenarios**\n    *   **λ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):** This is the mean free path of a residual gas molecule moving and colliding with other identical gas molecules. The number of gas molecules per unit volume is 'n', and the collision cross-section is the kinetic cross-section between two neutral molecules, let's call it σ_gg. The forces involved here are very short-range (van der Waals forces), essentially requiring the molecules to physically \"touch.\"\n    *   **λ2 (Electron-Gas Collision):** This is the mean free path of an electron from the high-energy beam traveling until it collides with a residual gas molecule. The number density of target gas molecules is the same 'n'. The collision cross-section is for an electron interacting with a neutral molecule, let's call it σ_eg.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n    *   **Gas-Gas Interaction (σ_gg):** This is a collision between two electrically neutral objects. They only interact strongly when they are very close, so σ_gg is related to the physical size (diameter) of the molecules.\n    *   **Electron-Gas Interaction (σ_eg):** This is a collision between a charged particle (the electron) and a gas molecule. Although the gas molecule is neutral overall, it is composed of a positive nucleus and a negative electron cloud. This charge distribution creates an electric field that extends far beyond the physical boundary of the molecule.\n    *   The electron, being a charge, interacts with this electric field via the long-range Coulomb force.\n    *   In the context of a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), any scattering event that knocks an electron out of the main beam path, even by a tiny angle, counts as a \"collision\" because it degrades the image.\n    *   Because the Coulomb force is long-range, an electron can be scattered (i.e., \"collide\") even if it passes relatively far from the gas molecule. In contrast, two neutral molecules must almost touch to collide.\n    *   Therefore, the effective target area for an electron-molecule interaction is significantly larger than for a molecule-molecule interaction.\n    *   Conclusion: **σ_eg > σ_gg**\n\n4.  **Relate the Cross-Sections back to the Mean Free Paths**\n    *   We have the relationships:\n        *   λ1 ∝ 1 / σ_gg\n        *   λ2 ∝ 1 / σ_eg\n    *   Since we concluded that σ_eg > σ_gg, the particle with the larger collision cross-section (the electron) will have the shorter mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, it must be that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation -> Incorrect. The interaction types and cross-sections are different.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> Incorrect. This implies λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1 -> Correct. This matches our physical reasoning.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> Incorrect. This implies λ2 is larger than λ1.\n\nThe numbers like `1.22` in options B and D are distractors, designed to make you look for a complex quantitative formula when the problem can be solved with a qualitative physical comparison of the interaction types.\n\n<<<C>>>"
