    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1 Analysis**\n\n**2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition (or 1,4-conjugate addition). This reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (an enolate in this case) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), at the C2 and C6 positions.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically bulky base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons of the ketone:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is quaternary, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1 (carbonyl), and C3. It has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is tertiary, bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1 (carbonyl), and C5. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The bulky nature of t-BuOK also favors deprotonation at the less sterically hindered position, which is C6. This forms a specific, regioselective enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n4.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. In CH₂=CH-COOEt, the β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Following the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated during the workup step to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The initial ketone skeleton remains intact. A new side chain, `–CH₂CH₂COOEt`, is attached to the C6 position of the ring.\n    *   The final structure has the carbonyl at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and both a methyl group and the new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group at C6.\n\n6.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options provide names where the propanoate chain is treated as the parent molecule.\n    *   The name is in the format: `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`. This means the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent attached to C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to number the cyclohexyl ring substituent according to IUPAC rules, starting from the point of attachment (which was C6 of the original ketone).\n        *   **C1' (of the ring substituent):** The point of attachment. This carbon also bears the original methyl group from the C6 position.\n        *   **C2'**: The adjacent carbon, which bears the carbonyl group (originally C1).\n        *   **C3'**: The next carbon, bearing the geminal ethyl and methyl groups (originally C2).\n    *   Based on this numbering, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for product A in options B and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2 Analysis**\n\n**1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`), which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n4.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile. In CH₃-CH=CH-CN, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group (`-CH(CH₃)-`).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting carbanion (α to the nitrile group) is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The new C-C bond connects the C1 of the original 1-nitropropane and the C3 of the original butenenitrile.\n    *   The structure is: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n6.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`). The carbon of the nitrile group is assigned as C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long: `(CN)-C-C-C-C-C`.\n    *   Numbering the chain from C1:\n        `C¹N – C²H₂ – C³H(CH₃) – C⁴H(NO₂) – C⁵H₂ – C⁶H₃`\n    *   The parent alkane is hexane, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name for product B in options C and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = wrong, B = wrong\n*   B) A = right, B = wrong\n*   C) A = wrong, B = right\n*   D) A = right, B = right\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
