    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation for the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the chemical formula of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 to count the number of atoms.\n\n*   `(CH3)2C`: 1 central Carbon + 2 methyl groups (2 C, 6 H). Total = 3 C, 6 H.\n*   `=CH-`: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 chain Carbon + 1 methyl group (1 C, 3 H). Total = 2 C, 4 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   `-CH=`: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 central Carbon + 2 methyl groups (2 C, 6 H). Total = 3 C, 6 H.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we calculate the molar mass of C12H22. Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol:\n*   Molar Mass = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n### **2. Count the Chemical Bonds**\n\nWe need to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `=`. So, **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** In an acyclic molecule with C carbon atoms, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds (single and multiple) is C - 1.\n    *   Total C-C links = 12 - 1 = 11.\n    *   Since there are 2 C=C bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n*   **C-H single bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms. So, **22 C-H bonds**.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy Change**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is calculated using the following relationship based on Hess's Law:\n\n**ΔHf = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Total bond energy of the product]**\n\n**a) Enthalpy of atomization of reactants:**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid Carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of C atoms and 22 moles of H atoms).\n\n*   Atomization of Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Atomization of Hydrogen: This requires breaking the H-H bonds in 11 moles of H2.\n    11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**b) Total bond energy of the product (C12H22):**\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms combine to form the molecule. It's the sum of all the bond energies in the molecule.\n\n*   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total bond energy of the product** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ**.\n\n**c) Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf) in kJ/mol:**\n\n*   ΔHf = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **4. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include units of kJ/g. We need to convert our result using the molar mass calculated earlier (166 g/mol).\n\n*   ΔHf (kJ/g) = (ΔHf in kJ/mol) / (Molar Mass in g/mol)\n*   ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nH_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nBE_H_H = 100      # kJ/mol\nBE_C_C = 200      # kJ/mol\nBE_C_C_double = 300 # kJ/mol\nBE_C_H = 400      # kJ/mol\n\n# Step 1: Atoms and Bonds Count for C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_C_C_double_bonds = 2\nnum_C_C_single_bonds = 9  # Total C-C links are 12-1=11.
