    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Parent structure:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a \"meta, meta\" arrangement relative to the acetyl group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent affects electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Formed by Friedel-Crafts acylation. It is a **deactivating** group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Formed by bromination. It is a **deactivating** group but an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Formed by nitration. It is a strongly **deactivating** group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate General Synthetic Strategies**\n\nA key consideration is the sensitivity of the reactions. Friedel-Crafts reactions (acylation and alkylation) do not work on strongly deactivated benzene rings, such as those bearing a nitro group. This means the acetyl group must be added before the nitro group, or at least not onto a ring that is already heavily deactivated (like nitrobenzene). This immediately calls into question any sequence that attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation on a nitrated ring.\n\nSince all substituents are meta to each other, a powerful strategy is to first introduce a meta-directing group and then add the other substituents.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    *   Steps i) to iv) are: Nitration -> Reduction to amine -> Diazotization -> Deamination. This sequence on benzene results in benzene. `Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline -> Benzenediazonium salt -> Benzene`. So, the first four steps effectively cancel out.\n    *   The sequence effectively becomes: `Benzene -> (v) Bromination -> (vi) Acylation -> (vii) Nitration`.\n    *   (v) Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene. The -Br is an o,p-director.\n    *   (vi) Acylation of bromobenzene gives primarily *p*-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   (vii) Nitration of *p*-bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 is m-director, -Br is o,p-director) leads to nitration at the position ortho to the bromine (position 2), yielding 4-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone. This is the wrong isomer. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   (i) Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene.\n    *   (ii) Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of *o*- and *p*-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   (iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of bromonitrobenzene. The ring is deactivated by both a -Br and a -NO2 group. Friedel-Crafts acylation will fail or give a negligible yield. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   (i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n    *   The problem arises immediately. If we were to perform acylation on nitrobenzene, it would fail. The sequence cleverly tries to circumvent this by reducing the nitro group first.\n    *   (ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n    *   (iii) Acylation of aniline with `CH3COCl/AlCl3` is problematic. The basic amine (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid (AlCl3) to form a complex (-NH2-AlCl3), which strongly deactivates the ring and becomes a meta-director. Acylation would occur meta to this group, yielding *m*-aminoacetophenone.\n    *   (iv) Bromination of *m*-aminoacetophenone. The ring has an activating o,p-director (-NH2) and a deactivating m-director (-COCH3) that oppose each other. This reaction would not give a single, high-yield product. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    *   Let's analyze the first three steps, which constitute a complete synthesis.\n    *   (i) **Acylation:** Benzene + `CH3COCl/AlCl3` -> Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director. This is a good first step.\n    *   (ii) **Bromination:** Acetophenone + `Br2/FeBr3` -> 3-Bromoacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. This works perfectly.\n    *   (iii) **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In 3-bromoacetophenone, the acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director (directs to C5) and the bromo group (-Br) is an ortho-, para-director (directs to C2, C4, and C5). Both groups direct or allow substitution at C5. This reinforcing effect leads to a high yield of the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n    *   The first three steps of this sequence represent a chemically sound and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv-vii) describe the reduction of the nitro group, followed by other confusing steps that would modify or destroy the desired product. It is highly probable that these extra steps are a mistake in the question's options.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only option D contains a correct and efficient synthetic pathway to the target molecule. The sequence of (i) Acylation, (ii) Bromination, and (iii) Nitration is the most logical route. Despite the nonsensical steps listed after the synthesis is complete, this option is the only one that presents a valid core synthesis.\n\n<<<D>>>"
