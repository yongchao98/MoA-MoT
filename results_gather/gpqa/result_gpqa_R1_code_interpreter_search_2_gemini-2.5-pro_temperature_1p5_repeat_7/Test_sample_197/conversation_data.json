    "This problem requires calculating the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:** The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ions. They form a series of complexes. The cobalt-containing species are:\n    *   Free `Co^2+`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+` (monothiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]` (dithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]⁻` (trithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)` (tetrathiocyanato)\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]⁻ + [Co(SCN)4]^(2-)`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):** The overall stability constants relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`Co^2+`) and the free ligand (`SCN⁻`).\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN⁻]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]⁻ = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN⁻]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^(2-) = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN⁻]^4`\n\n4.  **Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of the free ion:** Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2.\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + (β1*[Co^2+]*[SCN⁻]) + (β2*[Co^2+]*[SCN⁻]^2) + (β3*[Co^2+]*[SCN⁻]^3) + (β4*[Co^2+]*[SCN⁻]^4)`\n\n    Factor out the `[Co^2+]` term:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]^2 + β3[SCN⁻]^3 + β4[SCN⁻]^4)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the mole fraction of the target complex:** The question asks for the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex. The mole fraction (α₂) of this complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)2]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN⁻]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]^2 + β3[SCN⁻]^3 + β4[SCN⁻]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α₂ = (β2 * [SCN⁻]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]^2 + β3[SCN⁻]^3 + β4[SCN⁻]^4)`\n\n6.  **Plug in the given values and compute:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not needed for this calculation, as it's assumed the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` is fixed at `0.1 M`. This is a reasonable assumption because the total ligand that could be bound is at most `4 * c(Co) = 0.04 M`, which is less than the total `[SCN⁻]` available.\n\n    To simplify, I will use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The numerator is the term for the target complex [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of terms for all Co-containing species,\n# normalized to the free Co2+ concentration.\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction\nfraction = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = fraction * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9%\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]` and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt-containing species:** In the solution, cobalt(II) ions react with thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ligands to form a series of complexes. The cobalt-containing species are the free ion and the successive complexes:\n    *   Free ion: `Co^2+`\n    *   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    *   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)3]⁻`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)`\n\n2.  **Express total cobalt concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]⁻ + [Co(SCN)4]^(2-)`\n\n3.  **Use overall stability constants (β):** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (β):\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN⁻]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]⁻ = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN⁻]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^(2-) = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN⁻]^4`\n\n4.  **Express total concentration in terms of the free ion:** Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN⁻] + β2[Co^2+][SCN⁻]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN⁻]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN⁻]^4`\n    By factoring out `[Co^2+]`, we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]^2 + β3[SCN⁻]^3 + β4[SCN⁻]^4)`\n\n5.  **Define and calculate the mole fraction (α₂):** The mole fraction of the target complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is denoted by α₂. It is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)2]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN⁻]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]^2 + β3[SCN⁻]^3 + β4[SCN⁻]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation. This means the fraction does not depend on the total cobalt concentration, only on the free ligand concentration.\n    `α₂ = (β2 * [SCN⁻]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]^2 + β3[SCN⁻]^3 + β4[SCN⁻]^4)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the given values and compute:**\n    *   Ligand concentration: `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n    *   Stability constants: `β1=9`, `β2=40`, `β3=63`, `β4=16`\n\n    Let's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β1 * [SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2 * [SCN⁻]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3 * [SCN⁻]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4 * [SCN⁻]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    Now, calculate the numerator and denominator:\n    *   Numerator = `β2 * [SCN⁻]^2 = 0.4`\n    *   Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    Calculate the fraction α₂:\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16915`\n\n7.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage = `α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16915 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe code execution confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
