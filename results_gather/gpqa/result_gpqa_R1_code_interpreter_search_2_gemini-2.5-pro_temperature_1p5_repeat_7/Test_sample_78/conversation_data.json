    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the product's NMR data to determine its structure.**\n\n    The problem provides the ¹H and ¹³C NMR data for the product formed from the reaction of Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O). Let's deduce the product's structure first.\n\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** The reaction is likely an isomerization, so the product should have the same molecular formula as the starting material, C₁₁H₁₂O.\n    *   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6. This indicates a combination of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n\n    *   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n        *   δ 197.7 (1C, s): This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone. This accounts for one DBE.\n        *   Signals between δ 126.9 and δ 144.1 indicate the presence of sp² carbons from an aromatic ring and a C=C double bond.\n        *   δ 21.3 and δ 28.4 are aliphatic sp³ carbons, corresponding to two methyl groups.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. They correspond to two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons (e.g., attached to a quaternary carbon, an aromatic ring, or a carbonyl group).\n        *   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets suggests one substituent is electron-donating and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing. An aromatic ring accounts for four DBEs.\n        *   One of the methyl groups (e.g., at 2.31 ppm) is likely attached to this aromatic ring, forming a *p*-tolyl group. The electron-donating `CH₃` group and a strongly electron-withdrawing group at the para position would create such a ¹H NMR pattern.\n        *   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): These are two doublets, each for one proton. They are in the vinyl region and are coupled to each other. This indicates a `-CH=CH-` group. This C=C double bond accounts for one DBE.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n        *   We have the following pieces: a *p*-tolyl group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`), a ketone group (`-C(=O)-`), another methyl group (`-CH₃`), and a vinyl group (`-CH=CH-`).\n        *   Let's connect these pieces. The most plausible structure that incorporates all fragments and matches the NMR data is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n        *   **Structure:** `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n        *   Let's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n            *   **Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O. Correct.\n            *   **DBE:** 4 (ring) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) = 6. Correct.\n            *   **¹H NMR Prediction:**\n                *   A methyl singlet for the `CH₃` on the tolyl ring (~2.3-2.4 ppm). Matches `δ 2.31`.\n                *   A methyl singlet for the acetyl `CH₃` group (`-CO-CH₃`) (~2.3-2.4 ppm). Matches `δ 2.28`.\n                *   Two doublets for the *p*-substituted ring. The `-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃` group is strongly electron-withdrawing, causing a large split. Matches `δ 7.08 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.71 (2H, d)`.\n                *   Two doublets for the trans `-CH=CH-` protons. The proton α to the carbonyl (`-CH-C=O`) is typically around 6.5-6.8 ppm. The proton β to the carbonyl (`Ar-CH=`) is around 7.4-7.7 ppm. This perfectly matches the signals at `δ 6.75 (1H, d)` and `δ 7.68 (1H, d)`.\n        *   The product structure is confidently identified as (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Step 2: Relate the Product to the Starting Material, Compound X.**\n\n    *   The reaction is an isomerization (the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O does not change).\n    *   The reaction conditions (DABCO, a base; high temperature) are known to promote rearrangements.\n    *   The product contains a *p*-tolyl group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`). Since this reaction is an isomerization of the side chain, the `p`-tolyl group must have been present in the starting material, Compound X. Simple base-catalyzed rearrangements do not typically move alkyl groups onto or around an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the Options for Compound X.**\n\n    Let's examine the names of the given options to see which one contains a *p*-tolyl group (or 4-methylphenyl group).\n\n    *   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-`. This compound contains the required `4-methylphenyl` (p-tolyl) moiety. Its structure is `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This vinyloxirane can undergo a known base-catalyzed rearrangement to form the identified product, `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The \"styryl\" group is `C₆H₅-CH=CH-`. This compound has an unsubstituted phenyl group, not a tolyl group. Therefore, it cannot be Compound X.\n    *   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** \"Styryl\" implies `C₆H₅-CH=CH-`. This is also typically `C₁₀H₁₀O`, which is the wrong formula, and it has an unsubstituted phenyl group. It cannot be Compound X.\n    *   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound contains an unsubstituted \"phenyl\" group, not a tolyl group. Therefore, it cannot be Compound X.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    Only option A contains the necessary 4-methylphenyl (p-tolyl) skeleton that is observed in the final product. The rearrangement of this specific vinyloxirane under basic conditions is a chemically plausible pathway to the product whose structure was determined from the NMR data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
