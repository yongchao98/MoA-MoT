    "*   **Analysis of the context:** The conversation takes place between two synthetic organic chemists. A primary task for such chemists is to synthesize a target molecule and then purify it from the reaction mixture, which may contain unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and reagents.\n\n*   **Analysis of the phrase:** \"My compounds are on top of each other\" is a common piece of laboratory jargon. It refers to a failure to separate two or more substances using a purification technique.\n\n*   **Evaluation of common purification techniques:**\n    *   **Chromatography (Thin-Layer or Column):** This is the most common purification method in a synthetic organic chemistry lab. It separates compounds based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This affinity is primarily determined by the compound's **polarity**. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will move through the chromatography column at the same rate and will not separate. On a Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) plate, which is used to visualize the separation, the spots corresponding to these compounds would appear at the same height (same Rf value), literally \"on top of each other.\" This is the most direct and common interpretation of the phrase.\n    *   **Distillation:** This technique separates liquids based on their **boiling points**. While a chemist could complain that their compounds have similar boiling points, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is less commonly used to describe this situation. It's more descriptive of the visual output of chromatography.\n    *   **Optical Rotation:** This is a physical property used for characterization, not separation. Similar optical rotations would not prevent purification by standard methods like chromatography or distillation.\n    *   **Non-covalent interactions:** While differences in polarity and boiling point are manifestations of different non-covalent interactions, this answer (A) is too general. The practical problem the chemist is facing is the similarity in a specific physical property that a separation technique relies upon.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" most strongly and commonly refers to a failed chromatographic separation, which occurs when the compounds being separated have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
