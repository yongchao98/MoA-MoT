As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2.**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance. This is the most severe phenotype possible, meaning the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for any resistance.\n    *   The double mutants involving `g2` (`g1g2` and `g2g3`) also show 0% resistance.\n    *   When the phenotype of a mutation in one gene (like `g2`) masks the phenotype of a mutation in another gene (like `g1` or `g3`), this is called **epistasis**. The `g2` mutation is epistatic to `g1` and `g3`.\n    *   In a genetic pathway, the upstream gene is often epistatic to the downstream genes. Given the information that one of the genes is a transcription factor (a regulator that turns other genes on), the most logical conclusion is that G2 is this transcription factor. If G2 is knocked out, it cannot activate the other resistance genes (like G1 and G3), leading to a complete loss of resistance, regardless of whether G1 and G3 are functional or not.\n    *   This initial analysis strongly supports the conclusion that **G2 is a transcription factor**. This allows us to eliminate option D, which claims G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Gene G1 and Gene G3.**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has 75% resistance (a loss of 25%).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has 50% resistance (a loss of 50%).\n    *   This tells us that both G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance pathway, but G3 has a larger individual contribution than G1.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` has only 10% resistance (a loss of 90%). The loss of resistance in the double mutant (90%) is greater than the sum of the individual losses (25% + 50% = 75%). This indicates a **synergistic** or **additive** interaction, not a simple linear pathway where one masks the other.\n    *   Let's evaluate the descriptions of the G1-G3 interaction from the remaining options (A, B, C):\n        *   **Pleiotropy** (Option C): This means one gene affects multiple traits. We only have data on one trait (resistance), so we cannot conclude anything about pleiotropy. This makes option C unlikely.\n        *   **Same promoter** (Option B): This is a hypothesis about how the genes are regulated at the DNA level. We have no data from this experiment to support it. This makes option B unlikely.\n        *   **Gene redundancy** (Option A): This occurs when two or more genes perform similar functions. If one is lost, the other(s) can partially or fully compensate. The fact that single mutants retain some function, but the double mutant is far more severe, is the classic hallmark of gene redundancy. Although G1 and G3 are not perfectly redundant (they have different effect sizes), they act in a redundant or compensatory manner within the same resistance pathway. This is the best description among the choices.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the epistasis claims between G1 and G3.**\n    *   Several options mention epistasis between G1 and G3. Let's test this.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" (Options A and C) would mean the `g1g3` double mutant has the same phenotype as the `g1` single mutant. This is false: the `g1g3` resistance is 10%, while the `g1` resistance is 75%.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" (Option B) would mean the `g1g3` double mutant has the same phenotype as the `g3` single mutant. This is also false: the `g1g3` resistance is 10%, while the `g3` resistance is 50%.\n    *   Therefore, the statements about epistasis *between G1 and G3* are incorrect in all options where they appear.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Select the Best Option.**\n    *   We have strong evidence that **G2 is a transcription factor** and that **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**. Both of these conclusions are present in option A.\n    *   We have refuted the key claims in options B (\"same promoter\") and C (\"pleiotropy\") as they are not supported by the data. We have definitively refuted option D (\"G1 is a transcription factor\").\n    *   Option A states: \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". While the last part (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on a classical definition, the first two parts are strongly supported by the experimental data. Compared to the other options, which contain unsupported claims or claims directly contradicted by the data, option A provides the most accurate overall description of the gene interactions. It is the best possible conclusion among the choices given.\n\n<<<A>>>"
