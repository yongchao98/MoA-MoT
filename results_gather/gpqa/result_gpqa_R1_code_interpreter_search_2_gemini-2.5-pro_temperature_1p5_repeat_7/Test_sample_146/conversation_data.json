    "This problem involves the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$). To solve this, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and its total energy.**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics problems, this usually implies we can work in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero, and the kinetic energy of the incoming particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$. The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Identify the final state and its total energy.**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   All four particles have the same mass $m_A$, with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the four final particles must move apart in such a way that their total momentum is also zero. By symmetry, they will all have the same magnitude of velocity ($v$) and therefore the same kinetic energy.\n    *   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    *   Substituting the value for $m_A c^2$: $E_{final} = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    *   The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.**\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} = \\frac{469}{300} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n5.  **Calculate the velocity, $v$, from the Lorentz factor.**\n    *   The relationship between $\\gamma$ and the velocity ratio $\\beta = v/c$ is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$.\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for $\\beta$:\n        *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        *   $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        *   $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Now, substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n        *   $\\beta \\approx 0.7687$\n\n6.  **Determine the final answer.**\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform the calculation with more precise values using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\n\n# Initial energy is the sum of rest mass energies of proton and antiproton\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# Total final energy is E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final\n# E_initial = 1200 * gamma\ngamma = E_initial / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c) from gamma\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = np.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"Initial Energy (MeV): {E_initial}\")\nprint(f\"Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma}\")\nprint(f\"Velocity ratio (v/c): {beta}\")\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is approximately {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\nThe calculation confirms that the velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Detailed analysis:**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The fundamental principle we will use is the conservation of total energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n    *   **Initial State**: The system initially consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in particle physics problems, implying that we can neglect the initial kinetic energy and consider both particles to be effectively at rest. We work in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero.\n    *   The energy in the initial state ($E_{initial}$) is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Final State**: The system in the final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   According to the problem, all these particles have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   After the annihilation, these four particles will be moving. The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, and $v$ is the velocity of the particle.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the initial momentum was zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. By symmetry, the simplest configuration is for all four particles to emerge with the same speed, $v$, in directions that cancel each other's momentum. Therefore, they all have the same kinetic energy and the same Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   The total energy in the final state ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2 = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Equating Initial and Final Energies**:\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n5.  **Solving for the velocity ($v$)**:\n    *   The velocity $v$ is related to the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ by the equation $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$, where $\\beta = v/c$. We need to solve for $\\beta$.\n    *   Squaring both sides: $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    *   Rearranging the terms: $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n        *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092}$\n        *   $\\beta \\approx \\sqrt{0.5908} \\approx 0.7686$\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The velocity of each particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.7686c$.\n    *   Rounding this to two decimal places gives $0.77c$.\n    *   This matches option D. The Python code output confirms this calculation with higher precision, giving $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
