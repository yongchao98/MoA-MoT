    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Decode the description and draw the structure:**\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main Groups:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) are all *meta* to one another. Let's place the highest priority group, the carboxylic acid, at position C1. The *meta* positions to C1 are C3 and C5. To make all three groups mutually *meta*, we can place the carbaldehyde at C3 and the cyano group at C5. (The distance between C1-C3, C3-C5, and C1-C5 are all *meta*).\n*   **Substituents relative to the Carboxylic Acid (at C1):**\n    *   *Ortho* positions are C2 and C6. These have a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group.\n    *   *Para* position is C4. This has a methoxy group (-OCH3).\n*   **Substituents relative to the Cyano group (at C5):**\n    *   *Ortho* positions are C4 and C6. These have the methoxy (-OCH3) and the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Combining the Information:**\n    *   We know methoxy is at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6.\n    *   Since the hydroxyl group is at C6, the dimethylamino group must be at the other position ortho to the carboxylic acid, which is C2.\n\n**The final structure is determined as follows:**\n*   **C1:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   **C2:** Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   **C3:** Carbaldehyde (-CHO)\n*   **C4:** Methoxy (-OCH3)\n*   **C5:** Cyano (-CN)\n*   **C6:** Hydroxyl (-OH)\n\n**2. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name:**\n\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among all the functional groups present.\n*   Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of benzoic acid. The carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n\n**3. Number the Benzene Ring:**\n\n*   We must number the ring starting from C1 in the direction that gives the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n*   **Numbering Clockwise:** The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   **Numbering Counter-Clockwise:** The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since both numbering directions give the identical locant set {2,3,4,5,6}, we must use a tie-breaker rule. The rule states that we assign the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**4. Apply the Alphabetical Tie-Breaker Rule:**\n\n*   First, let's list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n    1.  **C**yano (-CN)\n    2.  **D**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    3.  **F**ormyl (-CHO)\n    4.  **H**ydroxy (-OH)\n    5.  **M**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n*   Now, let's compare the two numbering schemes based on the locant given to the first group in the alphabetical list, \"cyano\".\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** The cyano group is at C5.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** The cyano group is at C3.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise numbering is correct.**\n\n**5. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name:**\n\n*   Using the correct counter-clockwise numbering, we have the following substituents and their locants:\n    *   **3-cyano**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl**\n    *   **2-hydroxy**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n*   Now, arrange these prefixes in alphabetical order and add the parent name at the end.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
