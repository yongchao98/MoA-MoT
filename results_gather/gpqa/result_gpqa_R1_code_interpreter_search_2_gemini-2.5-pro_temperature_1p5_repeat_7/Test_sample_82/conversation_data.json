    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the initial conditions and dilution:**\n*   **Initial solution:** 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** It's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. We need to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid solution that will be titrated.\n*   The dilution formula is M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, where:\n    *   M₁ = 0.05 M (initial concentration)\n    *   V₁ = 20.00 cm³ (initial volume)\n    *   V₂ = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (final volume)\n    *   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate pH at 25% titration:**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n*   This is a buffer region, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 4.73\n*   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is equivalent to the mole ratio, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, plug the values into the equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n\n**3. Calculate pH at the equivalence point:**\n*   First, we need to find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point. At this point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    *   Moles of acid = M_acid × V_acid = 0.025 M × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of base (V_base) = Moles of base / M_base = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The solution contains 0.001 mol of CH₃COO⁻.\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    *   V_total = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   Acetate is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) = 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now we can find the [OH⁻] concentration using the approximation Kb = [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻]:\n    *   [OH⁻]² = Kb × [CH₃COO⁻] = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02\n    *   [OH⁻]² = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) = 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) = 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe following Python script can be used to perform these calculations precisely.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75\nratio_25 = 0.25 / 0.75\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_25)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the equivalence point ---\n\n# Calculate the initial moles of the diluted acetic acid\n# Diluted concentration = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / (20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3) = 0.025 M\n# Volume = 40.00 cm3 = 0.040 L\nmoles_acid = 0.025 * 0.040\n\n# Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point\n# Concentration of NaOH = 0.1 M\nvolume_NaOH_eq = moles_acid / 0.1  # in Liters\n\n# Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point\ntotal_volume_eq = 0.040 + volume_NaOH_eq # in Liters\n\n# Calculate the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at the equivalence point\nconcentration_acetate = moles_acid / total_volume_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate the concentration of OH- from the hydrolysis of acetate\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [acetate] => [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nconcentration_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * concentration_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH at the equivalence point\npOH_eq = -math.log10(concentration_OH)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
