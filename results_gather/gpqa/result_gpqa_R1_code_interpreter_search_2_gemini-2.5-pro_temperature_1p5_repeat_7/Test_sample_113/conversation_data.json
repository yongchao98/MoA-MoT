    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The first reaction is the conversion of a ketone (butan-2-one) into a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   **Butan-2-one (CH₃COCH₂CH₃):** An unsymmetrical ketone, which is the electrophile.\n        *   **Sodium Cyanide (NaCN):** The source of the nucleophile, the cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n        *   **Reagent A:** Needed to complete the reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n            `CH₃(CH₂CH₃)C=O + CN⁻  ⇌  CH₃(CH₂CH₃)C(O⁻)CN`\n        2.  The alkoxide intermediate is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin. Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n            `CH₃(CH₂CH₃)C(O⁻)CN + H⁺  →  CH₃(CH₂CH₃)C(OH)CN`\n    *   **Evaluating options for A:**\n        *   The reaction is typically run under slightly acidic conditions (pH ~9-10). If the solution is too acidic, the cyanide ion (CN⁻) will be protonated to form HCN, which is a much weaker nucleophile, slowing the reaction. If it's too basic, the equilibrium might be slow to protonate the alkoxide.\n        *   A source of protons is needed. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) is the chemical species that represents an acid in an aqueous solution. This is the most direct and standard way to represent the required proton source for this step. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺ is a suitable choice.\n        *   NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) is also slightly acidic, but it is primarily known for forming bisulfite adducts with carbonyls. It's not the standard reagent used to provide protons in cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A should be a proton source, best represented by H₃O⁺. This narrows the choices to C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The second reaction is the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   **2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile:** The starting nitrile.\n        *   **Reagent B and Water (H₂O):** The reagents that drive the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        *   The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base. The carbon atom in the nitrile group is not very electrophilic, so a strong catalyst is needed.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Using a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water (which is H₃O⁺) protonates the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate (R-CONH₂) which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid (R-COOH) and an ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Using a strong base like NaOH also works, but it produces a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻), which requires a subsequent acidification step to yield the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B:**\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid and is a standard reagent for the direct hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of a nitrile, which requires more forcing conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be a strong acid to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile. Therefore, B = HCl is the correct choice.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   From our analysis, Reagent A is H₃O⁺ and Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
