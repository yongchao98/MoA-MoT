    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let's determine the empirical formula. The mass fraction of H being 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   For a hydrocarbon with general formula CxHy, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1) is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   If the formula is CnH2n (like in cycloalkanes or alkenes), the fraction is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   If the formula is CnH2n+2 (like in alkanes), the fraction is `(2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7(2n+2) = 14n+2`, which leads to `14n + 14 = 14n + 2`, an impossibility (14=2).\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen and is formed by the hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds. This means Z must be a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Among cycloalkanes, **cyclohexane (C6H12)** is a very common solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. So, n=6.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixtures X and Y and the Reactions**\n    *   **Mixture X** contains two equimolar liquids, let's call them A and B.\n        *   They decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n        *   They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   Hydrogenation of both A and B gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies A and B are both C6 hydrocarbons whose carbon skeletons can be reduced to a cyclohexane ring. The simplest assumption is that they are unsaturated derivatives of cyclohexane, like cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene.\n    *   **Mixture Y** is formed from X and contains two equimolar liquids, let's call them C and Z (since Z is a constituent of Y).\n        *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are unreactive towards Br2(aq). This includes saturated compounds (like cyclohexane) and aromatic compounds (like benzene).\n        *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means C must also be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   **The Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y via a **disproportionation** reaction over a heated platinum catalyst. This type of reaction typically involves hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n\n3.  **Hypothesize the Identity of A, B, and C**\n    *   Since A, B, and C are all C6 compounds that are related to cyclohexane (Z), let's list the possibilities.\n        *   A and B must be unsaturated C6 hydrocarbons without conjugated bonds. Good candidates are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. (1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n        *   C is a component of mixture Y, doesn't decolorize bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. A very strong candidate for this is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene doesn't react with bromine water and is readily hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n\n4.  **Construct and Verify the Reaction**\n    *   Let's propose a reaction between the components of X to form the components of Y. The most plausible reaction is a hydrogen transfer between cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   Reaction proposal: **Cyclohexene (A) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (B) → Cyclohexane (Z) + Benzene (C)**\n    *   Let's write the formulas: **C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6**\n    *   Let's check the atom balance:\n        *   Carbons: 6 + 6 = 12 on the left; 12 + 6 is not 12. My reaction is wrong. Let's recheck the logic. It seems that the dehydrogenation of one molecule provides the hydrogen for the hydrogenation of another. The transfer is catalytic.\n        *   Ah, the transfer is C6H8 (diene) gives H to C6H10 (monoene). No, that's unlikely. A more common reaction is the diene donating hydrogen to another molecule of diene.\n        *   Let's reconsider the classic Zelinsky disproportionation: `3 Cyclohexene -> Cyclohexane + 2 Benzene`. This does not start with an equimolar mixture.\n        *   Let's try the reaction between our proposed components A and B again. In this disproportionation, one molecule must be oxidized (lose H) and one must be reduced (gain H).\n        *   The hydrogen-poor molecule (1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8) will be dehydrogenated to benzene (C6H6). C6H8 → C6H6 + 2H.\n        *   The hydrogen-rich molecule (cyclohexene, C6H10) will be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12). C6H10 + 2H → C6H12.\n        *   Combining these gives the net reaction: **C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6**. This reaction is balanced.\n        *   Carbons: 6 + 6 = 12 on the left; 6 + 6 = 12 on the right.\n        *   Hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18 on the left; 12 + 6 = 18 on the right.\n        The reaction is balanced and represents the hydrogen transfer.\n\n5.  **Final Check of All Conditions**\n    *   **X**: Equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (A) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (B). (Fits)\n    *   **Decolorizes Br2 water?**: Yes, both A and B have double bonds. (Fits)\n    *   **No conjugated bonds?**: Cyclohexene has one C=C. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated C=C bonds. (Fits)\n    *   **Reaction**: A+B -> C+Z, a disproportionation producing an equimolar mixture Y. Our reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H12 + C6H6` produces a 1:1 molar ratio of products. (Fits)\n    *   **Y**: Mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene (C). (Fits)\n    *   **Y doesn't decolorize Br2 water?**: Cyclohexane is saturated. Benzene does not react with Br2 water under these conditions. (Fits)\n    *   **Hydrogenation of X?**: Hydrogenation of C6H10 and C6H8 both yield C6H12 (Z). (Fits)\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y?**: Hydrogenation of C6H12 yields C6H12 (Z). Hydrogenation of C6H6 yields C6H12 (Z). So, only Z is produced. (Fits)\n    *   **All conditions are met by this chemical scheme.**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Liquid A is cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid B is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
