    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Parallax and its relation to distance:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx ∝ 1/d`\n    or\n    `d ∝ 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Assumption of Uniform Distribution:**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance:**\n    Let's consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the Earth. The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    The total number of stars (`N`) inside this sphere is the volume multiplied by the constant star density:\n    `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    Since `ρ`, `4/3`, and `π` are constants, the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance:\n    `N(d) ∝ d³`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    Now, we substitute the relationship between distance and parallax (`d ∝ 1/plx`) into the expression for the number of stars:\n    `N(plx) ∝ (1/plx)³ = 1/plx³`\n    This expression `N(plx)` represents the total (cumulative) number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx`. This is because a smaller distance `d` corresponds to a larger parallax `plx`, so `N(plx)` counts all stars within the sphere of radius `d = 1/plx`.\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*, not the total number. This is a differential quantity, which we can find by differentiating the cumulative number `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`. Let's call this quantity `n(plx)`.\n    `n(plx) = dN/d(plx)`\n    Let's perform the differentiation (ignoring the constants of proportionality):\n    `N(plx) ∝ plx⁻³`\n    `n(plx) = d/d(plx) (plx⁻³) ∝ -3 * plx⁻⁴`\n    `n(plx) ∝ -1/plx⁴`\n\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as parallax increases, the number of stars in that range decreases. We are interested in the magnitude of the relationship. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n**Alternative approach (using spherical shells):**\n\n1.  Consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell `dV` is `dV = 4πd²dd`.\n2.  The number of stars `dN` in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd²dd`.\n3.  We need to express `dN` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`. We know `d = 1/plx`.\n4.  Differentiating `d` with respect to `plx` gives `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`, so `dd = -(1/plx²)d(plx)`. We care about the magnitude, so `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n5.  Substitute `d` and `dd` into the expression for `dN`:\n    `|dN| = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`\n    `|dN| = (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) * |d(plx)|`\n6.  The number of stars per unit range of parallax is `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>"
