    "This is a multi-step chemistry puzzle. Let's break down the clues to identify substance X.\n\n1.  **Analyze Gas W**: The gas W, released from the reaction, has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple diatomic gases:\n    *   H₂ (¹H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n    *   D₂ (²H₂): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). **Yes.** D is deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   N₂ (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7). **Yes.**\n    *   O₂ (¹⁶O₂): 16 protons (8+8), 16 neutrons (8+8). **Yes.**\n    *   CO (¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons (6+8), 14 neutrons (6+8). **Yes.**\n\n2.  **Analyze Substance B**: A precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n    *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This is very close to the melting point of heavy water, D₂O, which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This strongly suggests that B is D₂O. The presence of D₂O supports the idea that the gas W is D₂ and that we are dealing with deuterium chemistry.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Reaction**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G, which on heating gives B (D₂O).\n    *   This points towards a powerful reducing agent that reacts with water. Let's hypothesize X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), a deuterated analog of the common reducing agent Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). This fits the clue that \"Substance X and its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis. If X is LiAlD₄ and it reacts with a liquid Y to produce D₂, then Y must be heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W), which fits our analysis.\n    *   It produces a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate.\n    *   Heating this precipitate would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3D₂O(g). This releases D₂O (B), which matches our melting point data.\n\n4.  **Confirm with the Keto Acid Reaction**: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n    *   A keto acid has a general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   LiAlD₄ is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH (or rather, R-CH(OD)-CH₂OD since we are in a deuterated environment).\n    *   The resulting product is a diol, which has exactly 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   This confirms our hypothesis. Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**: We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (by atomic number).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (by atomic number).\n    *   The question asks for the sum of the masses of all atoms of these two elements present in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule contains **one atom of Aluminum** and **four atoms of Deuterium**.\n    *   The mass number of the most common stable isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   The mass number of Deuterium (²H or D) is 2.\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Al) = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Mass from lightest element (D) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Cumulative mass = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nI will use a simple Python script to perform the final calculation.\n```python\n# Atomic mass of the most stable isotope of the heaviest element (Aluminum)\nmass_Al = 27\n\n# Atomic mass of the isotope of the lightest element (Deuterium, a heavy isotope of Hydrogen)\nmass_D = 2\n\n# Number of atoms of the heaviest element in the molecule (LiAlD4)\nnum_Al = 1\n\n# Number of atoms of the lightest element in the molecule (LiAlD4)\nnum_D = 4\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as per the problem description\ncumulative_mass = (num_Al * mass_Al) + (num_D * mass_D)\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<execute_output>\n35\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation confirms the result. The cumulative mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a multi-step chemical deduction problem. Let's break down the clues one by one to identify substance X.\n\n**1. Identifying Gas W and Isotope B:**\n*   The gas W released has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider some simple diatomic gases:\n    *   H₂ (using ¹H): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n    *   **D₂ (using ²H, Deuterium)**: Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This is a perfect match and consistent with the clue about a \"heavier isotope\".\n    *   N₂ (using ¹⁴N): Each nitrogen atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This is a possibility.\n    *   O₂ (using ¹⁶O): Each oxygen atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. The O₂ molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. This is a possibility.\n*   The precipitate G, upon heating, releases B. The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This is a very strong match. It confirms that **B is heavy water (D₂O)** and that the reaction involves deuterium. This makes **D₂ the most plausible identity for the gas W**.\n\n**2. Identifying Substance X and the Reaction:**\n*   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate G, which on heating gives D₂O (B).\n*   The reaction `Substance X + Liquid Y → D₂ (W) + Precipitate (G)` looks like a powerful reducing agent reacting with a source of deuterium. A common violent reaction is that of a metal hydride with water.\n*   Given the products are deuterated (D₂ and D₂O), it's logical that X is a metal deuteride and Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n*   The clue \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents. The most prominent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   Let's test this hypothesis:\n    *   **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G), which is analogous to the precipitate Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. This matches the observation that heating G releases B (D₂O).\n\n**3. Confirming with the Keto Acid Reaction:**\n*   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has 3 oxygen atoms (R-C(=O)-COOH).\n*   LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent that can reduce both of these functional groups to alcohols.\n*   Ketone → Secondary alcohol\n*   Carboxylic acid → Primary alcohol\n*   The overall reaction transforms the keto acid `R-C(=O)-COOH` into a diol, `R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH` (after an aqueous workup). This product contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**.\n*   This final clue confirms that Substance X is indeed **LiAlD₄**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation:**\n*   We need to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄.\n*   **Elements**: Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen, atomic number 1).\n*   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen (of which Deuterium is an isotope).\n*   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminum.\n*   **Molecule**: LiAlD₄ contains 1 atom of Aluminum and 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n*   We use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved:\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atom (assuming the most common isotope, ²⁷Al) = **27**.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's isotope (Deuterium, ²H) = **2**.\n*   The question asks for the cumulative mass, summing all instances:\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 atom × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Deuterium) = 4 atoms × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\nTo verify the calculation, a simple script can be used.\n```python\n# Mass number of the heaviest element's isotope (Aluminum-27)\nmass_heaviest_element = 27\n# Mass number of the lightest element's isotope (Deuterium-2)\nmass_lightest_element = 2\n\n# Number of atoms of the heaviest element in LiAlD4\ncount_heaviest = 1\n# Number of atoms of the lightest element in LiAlD4\ncount_lightest = 4\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass\ntotal_mass = (count_heaviest * mass_heaviest_element) + (count_lightest * mass_lightest_element)\n\nprint(total_mass)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning process has already been completed, and the provided code output confirms the calculation. Here is a summary of the logical steps that lead to the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Gas W and Substance B**: The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Combined with the clue about a \"heavier isotope,\" deuterium gas (D₂ or ²H₂) is a strong candidate (2 protons, 2 neutrons). The substance B, with a melting point of ~277 K (3.85 °C), is identified as heavy water (D₂O), which has a melting point of 3.82 °C. This confirms the reaction involves deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and the Reaction**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G) that yields D₂O upon heating. This points to X being a strong reducing agent, likely a metal deuteride, reacting with Y, which is heavy water (D₂O). The clue about X being a common organic chemistry reagent points to Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues for substance X.\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   The precipitate G is Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\n    *   Heating G produces Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).\n\n3.  **Confirm with the Keto Acid Reaction**: A keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH, 3 oxygens) is reduced by the powerful reagent LiAlD₄ to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains 2 oxygens. This confirms the identity of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**:\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium).\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum.\n    *   The molecule contains **one atom of Aluminum** and **four atoms of Deuterium**.\n    *   We sum the mass numbers of all atoms of these two types:\n        *   Mass from Aluminum (¹Al): 1 × 27 = 27\n        *   Mass from Deuterium (⁴D): 4 × 2 = 8\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script confirmed this result.\n\n<<<A>>>"
