    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.05 mol**\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Moles of H+ = **0.08 mol**\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.09 mol = **0.18 mol**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reaction between the strong acid (H+) and the strong base (OH-).**\n\n*   Moles of H+ = 0.08 mol\n*   Moles of OH- = 0.18 mol\n*   The reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   The hydroxide ions (OH-) are in excess. The hydrogen ions (H+) will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = Initial moles of OH- - Moles of H+\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = **0.10 mol**\n\n**3. React the remaining strong base (OH-) with the weak acid (CH3COOH).**\n\n*   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of remaining OH- = 0.10 mol\n*   The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n*   The acetic acid (CH3COOH) is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- consumed = 0.05 mol\n*   Final moles of OH- in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the final concentration of the excess hydroxide ions and determine the pH.**\n\n*   The final solution contains 0.05 mol of excess OH- (a strong base) and 0.05 mol of acetate (CH3COO-, a weak base). The pH of the solution will be dominated by the concentration of the strong base (OH-).\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution:\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   Calculate the final concentration of OH-:\n    *   [OH-] = Final moles of OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n*   Calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n*   Calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nLet's confirm the calculation with a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_baoh2 = 0.3 * 0.300\n\nmoles_h_strong = moles_hcl\nmoles_oh_strong = 2 * moles_baoh2\n\n# Step 2: Neutralization of strong acid and strong base\nmoles_oh_after_strong_acid_reaction = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong\n\n# Step 3: Reaction of remaining strong base with weak acid\nmoles_oh_final = moles_oh_after_strong_acid_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 4: Calculate pH\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nfinal_oh_concentration = moles_oh_final / total_volume_L\npOH = -math.log10(final_oh_concentration)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f'{pH=:.2f}')\n```\n<execute_result>\npH=12.62\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The final solution has an excess of strong base, Ba(OH)2. Here's the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Initial Moles Calculation:**\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid) = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of H+ (from strong acid HCl) = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- (from strong base Ba(OH)2) = 0.3 M * 0.3 L * 2 = 0.18 mol (Note: Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions per molecule).\n\n2.  **Neutralization Reactions:**\n    *   First, the strong acid (H+) reacts with the strong base (OH-):\n        H+ + OH- → H2O\n        0.08 mol H+ reacts with 0.08 mol OH-.\n        Remaining OH- = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n    *   Next, the remaining strong base (OH-) reacts with the weak acid (CH3COOH):\n        CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n        0.05 mol CH3COOH reacts with 0.05 mol OH-.\n        Remaining OH- in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n3.  **Final pH Calculation:**\n    *   The pH is determined by the excess strong base (OH-).\n    *   Total volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Final [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-]) = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\n<<<B>>>"
