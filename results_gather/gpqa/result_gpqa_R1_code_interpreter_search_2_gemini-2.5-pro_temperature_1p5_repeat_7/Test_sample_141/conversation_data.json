    "The user wants to find the geometrical representation (the Bloch vector) of the density matrix:\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\n**1. Understand the Density Matrix**\n\nThe given density matrix describes a quantum state. Let's write it in its matrix form. The standard basis vectors for a qubit are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe outer products are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, substitute these into the expression for œÅ:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis is $\\frac{1}{2}I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix. This state is known as the maximally mixed state.\n\n**2. Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Sphere**\n\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be represented by a point in the Bloch sphere. The relationship is given by the formula:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\nwhere:\n*   $I$ is the identity matrix.\n*   $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector, which represents the geometrical position of the state in the Bloch sphere.\n*   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices:\n    $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Solve for the Bloch Vector**\n\nWe can find the components of the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ using the formula:\n$r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$ for $i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nLet's calculate each component:\n\n*   **For r_x:**\n    $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $r_x = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/2 \\\\ 1/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0 + 0 = 0$\n\n*   **For r_y:**\n    $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $r_y = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i/2 \\\\ i/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0 + 0 = 0$\n\n*   **For r_z:**\n    $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $r_z = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0$\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe components of the Bloch vector are $r_x=0$, $r_y=0$, and $r_z=0$. Therefore, the vector representing the geometrical position is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\nThis result makes physical sense. The density matrix represents a state with a 50% chance of being $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and a 50% chance of being $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$. This is the state of maximum uncertainty, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, the origin of the coordinate system.\n\nComparing our result with the options provided:\nA) r=(0,0,1)\nB) r=(1,1,0)\nC) r=(0,0,0)\nD) r=(1,1,1)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
