    "*   **Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n    1.  **Identify Compound X from the Spectroscopic Data:**\n        *   **IR Spectrum:**\n            *   The broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n            *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n            *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of C=C bonds in an aromatic ring.\n            *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n        *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n            *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n            *   **Alkyl group analysis (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):**\n                *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n                *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is adjacent to both the methyl group and another group, making it a multiplet.\n                *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a methine group (-CH-).\n                *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine group (-CH-). It is bonded to the benzene ring (causing the downfield shift to 2.9 ppm), the methyl group at 1.4 ppm, and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.\n            *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and a -CH(CH₃)-. Connecting them gives -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n        *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, we have a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group in a para arrangement on a benzene ring. Therefore, compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches the structure in option (C).\n\n    2.  **Identify the Reaction and the Final Product:**\n        *   The reaction is with **red phosphorus and HI** (hydriodic acid).\n        *   This combination is a powerful reducing agent, famous for the complete reduction of many functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to their corresponding alkanes.\n        *   The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). The benzene ring and the sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be reduced.\n        *   Starting Material (X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Reaction: -COOH → -CH₃\n        *   Final Product: The product will have a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4 (or vice versa). The name is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n    3.  **Compare with the Options:**\n        *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n        *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced final product.\n        *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, compound X.\n        *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
