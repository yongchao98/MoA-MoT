    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We start with an uncharged, isolated spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity. This charge will exert an electric field.\n\n3.  **Conductor properties:** A key property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** To cancel the electric field from the `+q` charge within the bulk of the conductor, negative charges (electrons) in the conductor will be attracted towards the cavity. They will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface is zero. This implies that the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be exactly `-q`. The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner surface will be non-uniform, arranged precisely to make the combined electric field of the point charge `+q` and the induced inner charge `-q` equal to zero everywhere within the conductor and outside the cavity.\n\n5.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear somewhere else to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor. As there can be no net charge within the bulk of a conductor in equilibrium, this `+q` charge must reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Distribution of the Outer Charge (Electrostatic Shielding):** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. The charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the arrangement of charges inside the cavity. Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and there are no external electric fields, this induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The point P is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The point charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    As established in step 4, the combined electric field from the point charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Therefore, their contribution to the electric field at point P is zero.\n\n    This means the electric field at point P is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n8.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** For a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The final expression for the electric field at P depends only on the total charge `q` placed inside the conductor and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor. The other parameters given in the problem (`r`, `s`, `l`, `\\theta`) describe the internal geometry, which does not affect the external electric field due to the shielding property of the conductor. These parameters are extraneous information.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nOur derived result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
