    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, with two identical n-propyl groups on either side of the double bond (CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH3). It is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn-addition*, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   When a trans-alkene undergoes a syn-addition, it forms a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric products.\n    *   The intermediate product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H3O+).** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via a backside attack by a water molecule, which is an *anti-addition* mechanism.\n    *   Let's consider the fate of each enantiomer from the epoxide mixture:\n        *   The (4R,5R)-epoxide, upon anti-hydrolysis, will yield **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. The attack of water at either C4 or C5 results in the same achiral meso compound.\n        *   The (4S,5S)-epoxide, upon anti-hydrolysis, will also yield the same **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The sole product is the achiral meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nAn alternative way to think about the overall transformation (epoxidation followed by acid hydrolysis) is as an *anti-dihydroxylation*. A useful mnemonic is **TAME**: **T**rans + **A**nti = **M**eso **E**rythro. So, a trans-alkene undergoing anti-addition gives a meso product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (syn-addition).**\n    *   When a cis-alkene undergoes a syn-addition, it forms a single, achiral meso product.\n    *   The intermediate product is meso-(4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H3O+) (anti-addition).**\n    *   The meso-epoxide undergoes ring-opening. Because the starting epoxide is meso (achiral) and the reaction conditions are achiral, the product must be either achiral or a racemic mixture.\n    *   The backside attack of water at the two stereocenters (C4 and C5) is equally likely and leads to a pair of enantiomers.\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-center) leads to (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (S-center) leads to (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture (1:1 ratio) of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\nAn alternative way to think about this overall transformation is **CAR**: **C**is + **A**nti = **R**acemic. So, a cis-alkene undergoing anti-addition gives a racemic product.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nWhat are the relationships between these isomers?\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (they are stereoisomers but not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated into distinct peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols.\n    *   **Total peaks in standard HPLC = 2.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral phase.\n    *   Diastereomers are also separated.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol (which is achiral and gives a single peak).\n        *   **Peak 2:** The (4R,5R)-enantiomer.\n        *   **Peak 3:** The (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n    *   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 3.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
