The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm is next to an alkyl group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent:\n        *   A multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH group attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   A multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n        *   A doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) indicates a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group.\n        *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) indicates a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n    *   Assembling these fragments—a CH, a CH₂, and two CH₃ groups—and considering their splitting patterns, the alkyl group is identified as a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n\nBased on this analysis, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI\n\nThe reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a strong reduction. This reagent combination is known to completely reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The general reaction is:\n\nR-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂\n\nIn this specific case, the 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced. The carboxylic acid functional group is converted to a methyl group, while the *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n\nThe correct final product is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak at `3400–2500 cm-1` is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at `1720 cm-1` corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1` indicate the presence of a C=C bond in an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   The remaining signals (`2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`) must describe the other substituent on the ring. Let's piece it together:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` is a -CH3 group next to a -CH2 group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` is a -CH2 group next to the -CH3 and a -CH group. This confirms an ethyl fragment (-CH2CH3).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` is a -CH3 group next to a -CH group.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is a -CH group attached to the benzene ring, the ethyl group, and the methyl group.\n        *   Assembling these fragments gives a `sec-butyl` group: -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3).\n    *   Conclusion from NMR: The compound has a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction proceeds as follows:\n\nR-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 3I₂ + 2H₂O\n\nThe red phosphorus serves to regenerate the HI by reacting with the iodine (I₂) formed during the reaction, thus allowing the reduction to go to completion.\n\n### Identification of the Final Product\n\nApplying this reduction to the starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the carboxylic acid group is converted into a methyl group, while the sec-butyl group and the benzene ring remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is the starting material.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid is an isomer of the starting material but does not match the spectral data or the reaction product.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene is the correct product of the reduction.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene has an incorrect alkyl substituent.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, we must identify the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from its infrared (IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and another doublet at **7.2 ppm (2H)**, suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is next to an alkyl group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe a *sec*-butyl group:\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A methine (-CH) proton, which is deshielded because it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A methylene (-CH₂) group adjacent to the methine.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A methyl (-CH₃) group coupled to the methine proton.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A methyl (-CH₃) group coupled to the methylene group.\n\nCombining these observations, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n### Reaction and Final Product Identification\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydriodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to alkanes. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The *sec*-butyl group on the ring is unaffected by these conditions.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the spectroscopic analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid functional group to a methyl group. The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield because it is ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is more upfield, meaning it is ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to both a methyl group and a methine group (-CH).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, shifted downfield to 2.9 ppm, is characteristic of a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring).

This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction proceeds as follows:\n\nR-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 3I₂ + 2H₂O\n\nThe red phosphorus serves to regenerate the HI by reacting with the iodine (I₂) formed during the reaction, thus allowing the reduction to go to completion.\n\n### Identification of the Final Product\n\nApplying this reduction to the starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the carboxylic acid group is converted into a methyl group, while the sec-butyl group and the benzene ring remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is the starting material.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid is an isomer of the starting material but does not match the spectral data or the reaction product.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene is the correct product of the reduction.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene has an incorrect alkyl substituent.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, we must identify the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from its infrared (IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and another doublet at **7.2 ppm (2H)**, suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is next to an alkyl group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe a *sec*-butyl group:\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A methine (-CH) proton, which is deshielded because it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A methylene (-CH₂) group adjacent to the methine.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A methyl (-CH₃) group coupled to the methine proton.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A methyl (-CH₃) group coupled to the methylene group.\n\nCombining these observations, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n### Reaction and Final Product Identification\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydriodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to alkanes. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The *sec*-butyl group on the ring is unaffected by these conditions.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the spectroscopic analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid functional group to a methyl group. The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
