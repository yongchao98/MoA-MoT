    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity\n\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from their host star. The star wobbles as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength (`Δλ`) to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`):\n`Δλ / λ = v_r / c`\n\nWhere:\n-   `λ` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n-   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem states that the *periodic shift* for Planet #1 is up to 5 miliangstrom and for Planet #2 is 7 miliangstrom. This \"up to\" value represents the amplitude of the shift, `Δλ_max`. This amplitude is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as `K`.\n\n`K ∝ Δλ_max`\n\nTherefore, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n`K₂ / K₁ = Δλ_max₂ / Δλ_max₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4`\n\n### 2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the following formula, especially when the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`):\n\n`K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n\nWhere:\n-   `P` is the orbital period.\n-   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n-   `m_p * sin(i)` is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, where `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n-   `M_star` is the mass of the host star.\n\n### 3. Compare the Two Systems\n\nWe are given the following information to compare the two systems:\n-   The stars have the same masses: `M_star₁ = M_star₂`.\n-   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune\". In the context of RV detection, \"mass\" typically refers to the quantity that can be measured, which is the minimum mass `m_p * sin(i)`. It is a standard assumption in such problems that this measured quantity is what is being referred to as similar. Therefore, we assume `m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂)`.\n\nLet's write the ratio of `K₂` to `K₁` using the formula:\n\n`K₂ / K₁ = [ (2πG/P₂)^(1/3) * (m_p₂*sin(i₂)) / M_star₂^(2/3) ] / [ (2πG/P₁)^(1/3) * (m_p₁*sin(i₁)) / M_star₁^(2/3) ]`\n\nBecause `M_star₁ = M_star₂`, `m_p₁*sin(i₁) = m_p₂*sin(i₂)`, and `2πG` is a constant, most terms cancel out:\n\n`K₂ / K₁ = (1/P₂)^(1/3) / (1/P₁)^(1/3)`\n`K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`\n\n### 4. Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods\n\nWe want to find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. We already know that `K₂ / K₁ = 1.4`.\n\n`1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`\n\nTo solve for `P₂ / P₁`, let's first invert both sides of the equation:\n\n`1 / 1.4 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nWe know that `1.4 = 7/5`, so `1 / 1.4 = 5/7`.\n\n`5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, to isolate `P₂ / P₁`, we cube both sides of the equation:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n`P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³`\n`P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Value\n\nTo find the numerical answer, we perform the division.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\n# P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3\np_ratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(p_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately `0.3644`.\n\nThis value is very close to option C.\n\nThe reasoning implies that Planet #2, which causes a larger RV wobble, must have a shorter orbital period for the given constraints. Our result `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36` is less than 1, which is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods\n\nWe want to find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. We already know that `K₁ / K₂ = 5/7`.\n\n`5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nTo solve for `P₂ / P₁`, we need to isolate the term by cubing both sides of the equation:\n\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n`P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³`\n`P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Value\n\nThe final step is to calculate the numerical value of the fraction `125 / 343`. This was done using the Python code provided in the thinking process.\n\nThe calculation `(5/7)**3` yields `0.3644314868804665`.\n\nThis value rounds to `0.36`, which matches option C. This makes sense physically: Star #2 has a larger velocity (`K₂ > K₁`), which for a planet of the same mass, implies it must be in a tighter, faster (and thus shorter period) orbit. Our result `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36 < 1` confirms that Planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than Planet #1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
