    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T_eq,4 / T_eq,2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) * R_star^2 / (4 * a^2) )^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Relationship:** Since both Planet_4 and Planet_2 orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant for both. The problem states that they have the same albedo (`A`). Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis (`a`) are constant. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    `T_eq ∝ (1 / a^2)^(1/4)`\n    `T_eq ∝ (a^-2)^(1/4)`\n    `T_eq ∝ a^(-2/4)`\n    `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n\n4.  **Introduce Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (`P`) to the semi-major axis (`a`):\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3`\n    To use this in our temperature relation, we need to express `a` in terms of `P`:\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Combine the Relationships:** Now, substitute the expression for `a` from step 4 into the simplified temperature relationship from step 3:\n    `T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)`\n    `T_eq ∝ P^((2/3) * (-1/2))`\n    `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n    This means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We want to find the ratio T_eq,4 / T_eq,2. Using the proportionality from step 5:\n    `T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P_4)^(-1/3) / (P_2)^(-1/3)`\n    `T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3)`\n    `T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can take the ratio values for P2 and P4:\n    *   `P_2` corresponds to the ratio value of `2`.\n    *   `P_4` corresponds to the ratio value of `3.5`.\n    So, the ratio `P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5`.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio formula from step 6 and compute the result.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n# From the given information, the ratio of the periods P2:P4 is 2:3.5.\n\np2 = 2.0\np4 = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods\nperiod_ratio = p2 / p4\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbital period.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * [ (1 - A) * R_star² / (4 * a²) ]^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n2.  **Simplifying for the Ratio:**\n    Since both Planet_4 and Planet_2 orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem states they have the same albedo (A), so (1 - A) is also the same for both. Therefore, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n    T_eq ∝ (1 / a²)^(1/4)\n    T_eq ∝ a^(-2/4)\n    T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    To use this in our temperature relationship, we express 'a' in terms of 'P':\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n4.  **Combining the Relationships:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for 'a' into our simplified temperature proportionality:\n    T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)\n    T_eq ∝ P^((2/3) * (-1/2))\n    T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of Temperatures:**\n    We want to find the ratio T_eq,4 / T_eq,2. Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n    T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (P_4)^(-1/3) / (P_2)^(-1/3) = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Using the Given Period Ratios:**\n    The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can take the proportional values for the periods of Planet 2 and Planet 4:\n    *   P_2 ∝ 2\n    *   P_4 ∝ 3.5\n    The ratio of their periods is P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the period ratio into our temperature ratio formula:\n    T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nThe Python code calculated this value to be approximately 0.8298. When rounded to two decimal places, this is 0.83. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.75\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.69\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
