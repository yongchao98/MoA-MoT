    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to become very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. For a saturated aliphatic carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears in the 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present but does not help distinguish between the different isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four structures are fully saturated alkanoic acids, so they are all consistent with this observation.\n*   **Complex Signal Multiplicities:** This is the key piece of information for distinguishing the isomers. We are told the spectrum contains two distinct and complex signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n**3. Deducing the Local Environment from Signal Multiplicities**\n\nWe need to determine what kind of local proton environment would lead to these specific splitting patterns. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, chemically non-equivalent protons (the 'n+1' rule). When a proton is coupled to multiple different sets of neighboring protons, we observe a multiplet of multiplets.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be simultaneously coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (1+1 = 2 lines, a **d**oublet). This is typically a methine group (`-CH-`).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, a **t**riplet). This is typically a methylene group (`-CH2-`).\n    *   A group of **three** equivalent protons (3+1 = 4 lines, a **q**uartet). This is a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n    *   Therefore, the proton producing the `dtq` signal is a methine proton (`-CH-`) with a `CH`, a `CH2`, and a `CH3` group on adjacent carbons. Schematically: `R-CH-CH(this proton)-CH2-R'` and this proton's carbon is also bonded to a `CH3` group. Or a permutation like: `R-CH2-CH(this proton)(CH3)-CH-R'`.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (1+1 = 2 lines, a **d**oublet). This is a methine group (`-CH-`).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, a **t**riplet). This is a methylene group (`-CH2-`).\n    *   *Another, different* group of **two** equivalent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, another **t**riplet). This is a second, non-equivalent methylene group (`-CH2-`).\n    *   Therefore, the proton producing the `dtt` signal is a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to another `CH` group and two different `CH2` groups. Schematically: `R-CH2-CH(this proton)(CH2-R'')-CH-R'`.\n\n**4. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure**\n\nNow we must examine the structure of each option to see if it contains protons in the required environments to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. We will focus on the methine (`-CH-`) protons in the backbone of each molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(e)(CH3)-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(c)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH2-` group, a `-CH(e)-` group, and a `-CH3` group. Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This proton will be a **dtq**.\n    *   Proton **H(e)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(c)-` group and a `-CH3` group. Its neighbors are 1H and 3H. This proton will be a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH3-CH(b)(CH3)-CH(d)(CH3)-CH2-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(b)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(d)-` group and two `-CH3` groups. Its neighbors are 1H, 3H, and 3H. This proton will be a doublet of quartets of quartets (`dqq`).\n    *   Proton **H(d)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(b)-` group, a `-CH2-` group, and a `-CH3` group. Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 3H. This proton will be a **dtq**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2-CH(c)(C2H5)-CH(f)(C2H5)-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(c)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH2-` from the ethyl on the end, a `-CH(f)-` group, and a `-CH2-` from the ethyl substituent. Its neighbors are 1H, 2H, and 2H. This proton will be a **dtt**.\n    *   Proton **H(f)**: Is adjacent to a `-CH(c)-` group and a `-CH2-` from its ethyl substituent. Its neighbors are 1H and 2H. This proton will be a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** Has a `dtt` signal but not a `dtq` signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH3-CH(f)(C2H5)-CH(c)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH:**\n    *   Proton **H(f)**: This methine proton is on the carbon adjacent to a `CH3-` group, a `CH(c)` group, and a `C2H5` group (specifically its `-CH2-`). The neighboring protons are: the `-CH3` group (3H), the `H(c)` proton (1H), and the `-CH2-` of the ethyl group (2H). This proton will be coupled to groups of 1H, 2H, and 3H, giving a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   Proton **H(c)**: This methine proton is on the carbon adjacent to the `CH(f)` group, the `-CH2-COOH` group, and a `C2H5` group (specifically its `-CH2-`). The neighboring protons are: the `H(f)` proton (1H), the `-CH2-` group next to the acid (2H), and the `-CH2-` of its ethyl substituent (2H). This proton will be coupled to groups of 1H, 2H, and 2H, giving a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n    *   **Conclusion for D:** This structure contains a proton that produces a `dtq` signal AND a different proton that produces a `dtt` signal. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe only compound that has the necessary structural features to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` in its 1H NMR spectrum is structure D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
