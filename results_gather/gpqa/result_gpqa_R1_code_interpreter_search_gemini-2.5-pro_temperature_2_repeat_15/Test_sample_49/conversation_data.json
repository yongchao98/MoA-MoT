    "An analysis of the provided expression allows for the determination of the number of loops in the Feynman diagram. The key lies in understanding how different components of the expression relate to the properties of the diagram.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant term:** In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), calculations for processes involving loops have a very characteristic mathematical structure. The most direct indicator of the number of loops is the power of the factor `1/(4π)`.\n\n2.  **Origin of the `1/(4π)` factor:** When calculating a Feynman diagram with a loop, one has to integrate over the momentum circulating in the loop, which is not fixed by external conditions. In dimensional regularization (the standard technique) in a `D`-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral is of the form:\n    `∫ d^Dk / (2π)^D`\n    where `k` is the loop momentum.\n\n3.  **Integration in D=4:** After a series of standard steps (like Wick rotation and combining denominators with Feynman parameters), the momentum integral is performed. The angular part of this integration in `D` dimensions yields a factor proportional to `1/(4π)^(D/2)` per loop.\n    The problem specifies the theory is on **four-dimensional spacetime**, so we set `D=4`.\n    This means each loop in the diagram contributes a factor of:\n    `1 / (4π)^(4/2) = 1 / (4π)^2`\n\n4.  **Generalizing to L loops:** If a diagram has `L` independent loops, it will require `L` such integrations. Therefore, the overall factor from the loop integrations will be:\n    `(1 / (4π)^2)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`\n\n5.  **Analyzing the given expression:** The expression provided is:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n    We can see the term `1/(4π)^6`.\n\n6.  **Determining the number of loops (L):** By comparing the general form of the loop factor `1/(4π)^(2L)` with the specific factor in the expression `1/(4π)^6`, we can equate the exponents:\n    `2L = 6`\n    Solving for `L`, we get:\n    `L = 3`\n\n7.  **Consistency Check with Other Terms:**\n    *   **Coupling Constants (`alpha^3 * g^2`):** The powers of the coupling constants (`alpha` and `g`) typically correspond to the number of vertices in the diagram. Here, `alpha^3 * g^2` suggests there are 5 vertices in total (3 of one type, 2 of another).\n    *   **Topological Formula:** The number of loops (`L`), vertices (`V`), and internal lines (`I`) in a connected diagram are related by Euler's formula for polyhedra: `L = I - V + 1`. If we have `L=3` and `V=5`, then the number of internal lines would be `I = L + V - 1 = 3 + 5 - 1 = 7`. A diagram with 3 loops, 5 vertices, and 7 internal lines is topologically possible.\n    *   **Other Factors (`sqrt(2) * 8 * (Q/M)^2`):** The numerical constants (`sqrt(2) * 8`) can arise from symmetry factors, group theory calculations (like traces of SU(N) generators), or evaluating gamma matrix traces. The term `(Q/M)^2` represents the ratio of an external energy scale `Q` to a particle mass `M`, which commonly appears in the final result of loop calculations after renormalization. These terms are all consistent with a standard QFT calculation but do not determine the loop number as directly as the `(4π)` factor.\n\nConclusion: The factor `1/(4π)^6` is the definitive clue. It arises from three loop integrations in four-dimensional spacetime.\n\nThe diagram contained **3** loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
