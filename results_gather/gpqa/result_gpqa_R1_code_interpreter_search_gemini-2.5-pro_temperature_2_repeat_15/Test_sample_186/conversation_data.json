    "To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to follow a systematic approach for each star listed. The criterion for a star to be \"detectable\" is achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Limiting Magnitude of ESPRESSO\n\nThe key is to find the faintest apparent V-band magnitude (m_V) that ESPRESSO can observe to meet the detectability criterion. The performance of a spectrograph depends on many factors, including seeing conditions, airmass (related to the star's position in the sky), and instrument mode.\n\nThe official ESPRESSO user manual and exposure time calculators provide performance estimates. According to these resources, for typical observing conditions (seeing of 0.8 arcseconds, airmass of 1.2), ESPRESSO coupled with one 8-meter VLT unit telescope can achieve an S/N of approximately 10 in a 1-hour exposure for a star with an apparent V-band magnitude **m_V ≈ 16**.\n\nTherefore, any star with an apparent magnitude **m_V ≤ 16** will be detectable. We will use this as our detection threshold.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now determine the apparent V-band magnitude (m_V) and observability for each star.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky. Its apparent V-band magnitude is approximately -0.74.\n*   **Location (Declination):** Its declination is -52° 41'. This is well within the observable range of the VLT at Paranal Observatory (latitude ~ -24°).\n*   **Detectability:** Since m_V = -0.74 is much less than 16, Canopus is easily detectable.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Polaris has an apparent V-band magnitude of approximately +1.98.\n*   **Location (Declination):** Its declination is +89° 15'. Polaris is the North Star. The VLT is in the Southern Hemisphere, and its pointing is limited to objects with declinations south of about +30°. Polaris is therefore never visible from the Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Detectability:** Polaris is not observable from the VLT, so it is not detectable with ESPRESSO.\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15, d = 10 pc**\n*   We use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (m_V):\n    *   m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * (1) - 5 = 15\n*   **Location (Declination):** Its declination is 0°, which is on the celestial equator and is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** Since m_V = 15 is less than the limit of 16, this star is detectable.\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15, d = 200 pc**\n*   Using the distance modulus formula:\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * (2.301) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505\n*   **Location (Declination):** 0° declination, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** Since m_V = 21.5 is greater than 16, this star is too faint to be detected.\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc**\n*   Using the distance modulus formula:\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * (0.699) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495\n*   **Location (Declination):** 0° declination, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** Since m_V ≈ 13.5 is less than 16, this star is detectable.\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15, d = 50 pc**\n*   Using the distance modulus formula:\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * (1.699) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495\n*   **Location (Declination):** 0° declination, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** Since m_V ≈ 18.5 is greater than 16, this star is too faint to be detected.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLet's summarize the detectability of each star:\n*   a) **Canopus:** Detectable\n*   b) **Polaris:** Not detectable (not observable)\n*   c) **Star (d=10 pc):** Detectable\n*   d) **Star (d=200 pc):** Not detectable\n*   e) **Star (d=5 pc):** Detectable\n*   f) **Star (d=50 pc):** Not detectable\n\nThere are a total of **3** detectable stars.\n\n<<<C>>>"
