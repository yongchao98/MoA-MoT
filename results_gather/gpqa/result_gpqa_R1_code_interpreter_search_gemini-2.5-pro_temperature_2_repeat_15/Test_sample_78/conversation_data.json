    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reaction and Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Compound X with a molecular formula of C11H12O.\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K (130 °C) for 1 day. DABCO is a tertiary amine, known to act as a base or a nucleophilic catalyst. The high temperature and long reaction time suggest a thermal rearrangement, possibly catalyzed by DABCO.\n*   **Product:** The product of this reaction is an isomer of Compound X, as rearrangements do not change the molecular formula. So, the product also has the formula C11H12O.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, DoU = (2*C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2 = (2*11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (DoU = 4) and two additional degrees of unsaturation (e.g., a C=C bond and a C=O bond).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Structure of the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nWe will analyze the given 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra to deduce the structure of the product.\n\n*   **13C-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, most likely a ketone, as it's part of a conjugated system (which typically shifts it upfield from ~205 ppm to ~195 ppm). This confirms the C=O group suggested by the DoU.\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C) and δ 28.4 (1C):** These shifts are in the aliphatic region and correspond to the two methyl (CH3) groups.\n    *   **Aromatic/Vinylic Region (δ 126.9 to 144.1):**\n        *   The presence of two signals corresponding to two carbons each (`δ 126.9 (2C)` and `δ 129.1 (2C)`) is a strong indicator of a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, specifically a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring**.\n        *   This accounts for 4 CH carbons of the ring. The two quaternary carbons (to which the substituents are attached) would be among the other signals in this region (e.g., 141.5 and 144.1 ppm).\n        *   This leaves two more carbon signals in this region (`δ 127.1` and `δ 130.3`) which must correspond to the two carbons of a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This confirms the presence of two methyl (CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons, hence they appear as singlets. One is likely attached to the aromatic ring (a tolyl group), and the other to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** These are two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This is the classic A₂B₂ or AA'BB' pattern for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**, confirming the 13C analysis.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These are two doublets, each for one proton. They are coupled to each other and are in the vinylic region. This confirms the presence of a **-CH=CH-** group. The large difference in their chemical shifts suggests they are part of an α,β-unsaturated system, i.e., `-CH=CH-C=O`.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a `para-disubstituted benzene ring`. One substituent is a methyl group (`-CH₃`), forming a **p-tolyl group**. This accounts for one methyl singlet (`~δ 2.31`) and the pair of 2H doublets (`δ 7.08`, `δ 7.71`).\n    2.  We have an acetyl group (`-C(=O)CH₃`). This accounts for the `C=O` signal in the 13C-NMR and the second methyl singlet (`δ 2.28`).\n    3.  We have a `–CH=CH–` group.\n    4.  Connecting these pieces, the only structure that fits all the data is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n        `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n    5.  This structure is consistent with all spectral data: the tolyl group gives rise to the Ar-CH₃ singlet and the two aromatic doublets. The α,β-unsaturated ketone part gives the two vinylic doublets and the acetyl methyl singlet.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound X by Analyzing the Options**\n\nThe starting material, Compound X, must be an isomer of the product and must have the p-tolyl group present in its structure, since this group is unlikely to form during the reaction. The options provided are all epoxides. We must find the option that is an isomer of the product and has the correct core structure.\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (`C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH₃`):** Contains a phenyl group (`C₆H₅-`), not a tolyl group. Therefore, it cannot be the starting material.\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide (`C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`):** Has the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match C₁₁H₁₂O. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (`p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`):**\n    *   It contains a **p-tolyl group** (`p-CH₃-C₆H₄-`).\n    *   Its molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O (C₇H₇ from tolyl + C₂H₂ from vinyl + C₂H₃O from epoxyethyl = C₁₁H₁₂O). This matches.\n    *   This compound is a vinylic epoxide. The reaction described is a known (though sometimes complex) rearrangement of a vinylic epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The starting material `p-Tol-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂` isomerizes to the product `p-Tol-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane (`C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂`):** Contains a phenyl group, not a tolyl group. Therefore, it cannot be the starting material.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the logical elimination process, only option C possesses the correct molecular formula and the necessary structural fragment (the p-tolyl group) to form the product identified from the NMR data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
