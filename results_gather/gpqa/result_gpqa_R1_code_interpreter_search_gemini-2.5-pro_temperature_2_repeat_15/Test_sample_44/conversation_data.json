    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, spin-1/2 particles are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n\n2.  **Define the Quantum States:**\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy eigenvalues for a single particle in such a well are given by the formula:\n        $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n        where *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n    *   Since the particles are spin-1/2, they have a spin quantum number $m_s$ which can be either +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n    *   A complete quantum state for a particle is defined by the pair of quantum numbers (n, $m_s$). Due to the two possible spin states, each energy level $E_n$ can accommodate a maximum of two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down) without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy ($E_{ground}$):**\n    *   To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The lowest energy level is n=1 ($E_1 = 1^2 E = E$). We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   The next lowest energy level is n=2 ($E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$). We place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n        $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n        $E_{ground} = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n    *   The ground state configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2}.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. It can be achieved by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available energy level.\n    *   The highest occupied energy level in the ground state is n=2. The lowest unoccupied energy level is n=3 ($E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$).\n    *   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n    *   **Possibility A: Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n        *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4}.\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    *   **Possibility B: Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n        *   This is a valid excitation because the n=2 level is already full in the ground state, but promoting from n=1 frees up a state there. However, promoting a particle from a lower level costs more energy.\n        *   Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n        *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility C: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3}.\n        *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states calculated so far (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), we can order them:\n        *   Ground State: 10E\n        *   First Excited State: 15E\n        *   Second Excited State: 18E (This is the lowest energy after the first excited state).\n\n6.  **Final Result:**\n    *   Ground state energy = 10E\n    *   First excited state energy = 15E\n    *   Second excited state energy = 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
