    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to understand the functional groups and unsaturations present.\n\n*   **Parent chain:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation. The double bond is another degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Principal functional group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH). This group is located at position C1 of the ring and contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which is a degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position C2. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), adding another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is at position C5. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), adding a final degree of unsaturation.\n\nTo summarize the unsaturation in the reactant molecule:\n1.  One ring = 1 IHD\n2.  One C=C double bond in the ring = 1 IHD\n3.  One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group = 1 IHD\n4.  One C=O double bond in the formyl (aldehyde) group = 1 IHD\n5.  One C=C double bond in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\n\nThe total Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. This matches option A, but the question asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (hydroiodic acid). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for its ability to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. It also reduces carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n\nThe following transformations will occur:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring** will be reduced to a **single bond**.\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group** will be reduced to a **single bond**, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) into an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nBased on the reactions above, the initial `2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid` is converted into a saturated, substituted cyclohexane.\n*   The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` at C1 becomes a `methyl group`.\n*   The `formyl group` at C2 becomes a `methyl group`.\n*   The `vinyl group` at C5 becomes an `ethyl group`.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane or one of its stereoisomers).\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated by summing the number of rings and the number of pi bonds (each double bond is one pi bond, each triple bond is two).\n\n*   **Number of rings:** The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, there is 1 ring.\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** All the double bonds (C=C and C=O) from the reactant have been reduced to single bonds. Therefore, there are 0 pi bonds in the product molecule.\n\nThe IHD of the product is the sum of these contributions:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product and use the IHD formula.\n*   Reactant formula (C10H12O3, IHD=5)\n*   Product: The skeleton is now a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Number of Carbon atoms: 6 (ring) + 1 (from COOH) + 1 (from CHO) + 2 (from vinyl) = 10 Carbons.\n    *   Since the product is a saturated cycloalkane, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\n    *   IHD = 11 - 10\n    *   IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods give the same result. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning does not require complex computation, but we can verify the IHD calculation with a script.\n# The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n# Let's determine its molecular formula:\n# Ring carbons = 6\n# COOH group = 1 C\n# CHO group = 1 C\n# Vinyl group = 2 C\n# Total C = 10\n# Ring hydrogens: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H2) -> 7H\n# COOH hydrogen = 1H\n# CHO hydrogen = 1H\n# Vinyl hydrogens = 3H\n# Total H = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n# Oxygens = 2 from COOH, 1 from CHO -> 3O\n# Reactant formula: C10H12O3\n#\n# The product is a substituted cyclohexane with 10 carbon atoms.\n# A substituted cycloalkane has the general formula CnH2n.\n# So, the product formula is C10H20.\n#\n# Let's calculate the IHD for the product with formula C10H20.\n# IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n# C = 10\n# H = 20\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nprint(int(IHD))\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed from a specific chemical reaction.\n\n### **1. Identify the Reactant and Reagents**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n### **2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. Its primary function is to completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups to alkanes and to saturate any carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n\nLet's break down the functional groups and unsaturations in the reactant molecule and see how they are affected:\n\n*   **Carboxylic acid group (-COOH):** This group at position 1 will be completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The C=O bond is removed.\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO):** This aldehyde group at position 2 will also be completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The C=O bond is removed.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene ring:** The carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring will be hydrogenated (reduced) to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C). The ring itself, being a cyclic structure, remains.\n*   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH₂):** The carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the vinyl group will be reduced to a single bond, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\n### **3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\n*   The original `cyclohexene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   All C=C and C=O double bonds are eliminated.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n\nLet's calculate the IHD for the final product:\n*   **Number of rings:** The six-membered ring structure is preserved. So, there is **1 ring**.\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** All double bonds (three in total: one C=C in the ring, one C=C in the vinyl group, one C=O in the carboxylic acid, and one C=O in the formyl group were all reduced to single bonds. Therefore, there are **0 pi bonds** in the product.\n\n**IHD of the product = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1**\n\n### **4. Verification using Molecular Formula (Optional)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n    *   Formula: C₁₀H₁₂O₃\n    *   IHD (Reactant) = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. (This confirms our initial analysis: 1 ring + 1 C=C in ring + 1 C=C in vinyl + 1 C=O in COOH + 1 C=O in CHO = 5)\n\n*   **Product:** The product is a substituted cyclohexane (5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane). It is a saturated cycloalkane. A saturated hydrocarbon with 10 carbons and one ring would have the formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Formula: C₁₀H₂₀\n    *   IHD (Product) = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
