    "`p` stands for proton and `p_bar` for antiproton. `A^+` and `A^-` are the resulting particles.\nThe problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can approximate both the proton and the antiproton as being at rest before the annihilation.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The total energy before the collision ($E_i$) must equal the total energy after the collision ($E_f$).\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):**\n    *   The system consists of a proton and an antiproton, both considered at rest.\n    *   The energy is their combined rest mass energy.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   **Final Energy ($E_f$):**\n    *   The system consists of four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$.\n    *   Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are likely antiparticles, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The four particles will share the total initial energy equally, due to conservation of momentum (explained next). Each will have both rest energy and kinetic energy.\n    *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$, where $E_A$ is the total energy of a single particle A.\n*   **Equating energies:**\n    *   $E_i = E_f \\implies 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    *   $E_A = \\frac{1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   **Initial Momentum ($p_i$):**\n    *   Since both the proton and antiproton are at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n    *   $p_i = 0$.\n*   **Final Momentum ($p_f$):**\n    *   The total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero to conserve momentum.\n    *   $\\vec{p}_f = \\vec{p}_{A1^+} + \\vec{p}_{A2^+} + \\vec{p}_{A1^-} + \\vec{p}_{A2^-} = 0$.\n    *   The most symmetric and simplest way to achieve this is if the particles fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. For the system to be balanced, this implies that the total energy is distributed equally among the four identical-mass particles. Our energy calculation based on this assumption is valid.\n\n**3. Calculate the Velocity**\n\n*   We now know the total energy ($E_A$) and the rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) for a single particle A. We can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n*   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   We have:\n    *   $E_A = 469.135 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$ (given)\n*   Now, we find $\\gamma$:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Finally, we solve for the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\implies \\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    *   $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    *   $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
