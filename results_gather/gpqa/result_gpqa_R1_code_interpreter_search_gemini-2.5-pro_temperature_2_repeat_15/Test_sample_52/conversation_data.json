    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the basic structural information:**\n    *   The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is based on a benzene ring with two substituents, with a core formula of C6H4.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the given formula options.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR data:** The 1H NMR spectrum gives us the most detailed clues about the hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic-H (two signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring can have ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-) substitution.\n        *   For different substituents, ortho and meta patterns would typically result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n        *   A para (1,4-) substitution pattern, due to its symmetry, results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons. Each signal would represent two equivalent protons, typically appearing as a doublet. Therefore, the \"two signals\" strongly suggest a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. These four protons (4H) are part of the C6H4 core.\n\n    *   **–CH2 groups (no signals):** The problem explicitly states there are no signals for –CH2– groups. This is a crucial piece of information. The ester group could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3), an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), a propyl ester (-COOCH2CH2CH3), etc. The absence of a –CH2– signal rules out ethyl and propyl esters, leaving **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** as the most likely candidate. This fragment accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n\n    *   **Vinyl-H (two signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The specific splitting pattern provided is very informative.\n        *   A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) means a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and to a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n        *   A \"doublet\" (d) means a proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n        *   This pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   Proton H(a) is coupled to H(b), so its signal is a **doublet**.\n            *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (a doublet) and also to the three protons of the CH3 group (a quartet). Therefore, its signal is a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This matches the data perfectly. This propenyl group fragment has the formula -C3H5.\n\n    *   **–CH3 groups (two signals):** We have accounted for both methyl groups now.\n        *   One is the methyl group of the methyl ester (-COOCH3). This would be a singlet signal as it has no adjacent protons.\n        *   The other is the methyl group of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This signal would be a doublet, as it is coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton, H(b).\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure and determine the formula:** Based on the analysis above, the unknown compound is composed of:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1: A methyl ester group, -COOCH3 (Formula fragment: C2O2H3)\n    *   Substituent 2: A propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3 (Formula fragment: C3H5)\n\n    The full structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total chemical formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 2 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester) + 5 (from propenyl) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\n    The final chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option A. We can also confirm that the other options are incorrect. For instance, C12H14O2 would likely be ethyl 4-propylbenzoate or a similar isomer, which would either lack vinyl protons or contain a -CH2- group, both contradicting the data.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
