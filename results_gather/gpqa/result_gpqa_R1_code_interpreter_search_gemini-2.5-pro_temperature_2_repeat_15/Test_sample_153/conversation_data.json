    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher (M+2).\n    *   The intensity of the M+2 peak is 32% of the M⁺ peak (100%).\n    *   The M⁺ to M+2 ratio of 100:32 (approximately 3:1) is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes have natural abundances of approximately 75.8% and 24.2%, respectively, giving a ratio of ~3:1).\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options.\n        *   A) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n        *   B) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n        *   C) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n        *   D) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n    *   All options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   There is a very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded. The broadness is a key feature.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch. The position is consistent with a conjugated carboxylic acid (an aromatic carboxylic acid).\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   This eliminates option A (which is a phenol and an aldehyde) and option C (which is a chloroformate, lacks an O-H group, and its C=O stretch would be at a much higher frequency, ~1780-1815 cm⁻¹).\n    *   We are now left with options B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid), both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, which is the typical chemical shift for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The 's' indicates it's a singlet (no adjacent protons, which is typical for acidic protons), and '1H' means it corresponds to one proton. This confirms the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n        *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet corresponding to two protons.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet corresponding to two protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two substituents create a plane of symmetry, so there are only two types of aromatic protons. Each type has one neighbor, hence they appear as doublets.\n    *   Let's look at the remaining options:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly this pattern of two doublets for its four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing COOH group would be more deshielded (further downfield, 8.02 ppm), and the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be less deshielded (7.72 ppm). This is a perfect match.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene ring. There is no plane of symmetry through the bonds. It would have four distinct aromatic protons, each with a different chemical shift, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four signals, likely a combination of doublets, triplets, or doublet of doublets). This does not match the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Based on the combined analysis of MS, IR, and especially the ¹H NMR data, the only structure that fits all the evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
