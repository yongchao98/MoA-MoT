    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring. The name `bicyclo[4.1.0]` indicates a 6-membered ring and a 3-membered ring sharing the C1-C6 bond. The `7-oxa` part means the atom bridging C1 and C6 with a path length of 0 is an oxygen, forming an epoxide.\n    *   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me₂CuLi`, lithium dimethylcuprate, which is a Gilman reagent. Gilman reagents are excellent sources of soft nucleophiles, in this case, a methyl nucleophile (effectively `CH₃⁻`).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   The problem provides a crucial rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\" This is a characteristic feature of reactions of epoxides with organocuprates.\n    *   The epoxide ring consists of carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (it's bonded to C2, C6, the oxygen, and a methyl group).\n    *   Carbon C6 is only bonded to other carbons and a hydrogen, making it a **tertiary** carbon (it's bonded to C1, C5, the oxygen, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Comparing the steric hindrance, the tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This confirms the reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**.\n    *   **At the site of attack (C6):** The nucleophile (CH₃⁻) performs a backside attack on the C-O bond at C6. This leads to an inversion of the stereocenter. The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**. Inversion will change it to **(R)**.\n    *   **At the other epoxide carbon (C1):** This carbon is not directly attacked. The C1-O bond breaks during the reaction, and this oxygen is later protonated (in the workup step, which is assumed) to form an -OH group. The stereochemical configuration at C1 is **retained**. The starting configuration is given as **(R)**, so it remains **(R)** in the product.\n    *   **At the other chiral centers (C3 and C4):** These centers are remote from the reaction site and are not affected. Their absolute spatial arrangement remains unchanged. The starting configuration at C3 is **(R)** and at C4 is **(R)**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The attack opens the epoxide ring to form a cyclohexanol derivative.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) will be on C1. By IUPAC rules, this carbon gets the highest priority and is numbered as C1 in the final product.\n    *   The original C6, where the new methyl group attached, will be C2 in the new numbering scheme.\n    *   The product molecule will be a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. (Methyls at old C1, new Me at old C6, old C3, and old C4).\n    *   Let's map the stereochemistry to the new IUPAC numbering:\n        *   New C1 (from old C1): Configuration is retained -> **1R**\n        *   New C2 (from old C6): Configuration is inverted -> **2R** (from 6S)\n        *   New C4 (from old C4): Configuration is retained -> **4R**\n        *   New C5 (from old C3): Configuration is retained -> **5R**\n    *   Therefore, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n5.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2)\n    *   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect substitution pattern)\n    *   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect substitution and stereochemistry)\n    *   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Matches our derived structure and name)\n\nThe correct product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
