    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a neutral spherical conductor with an off-center spherical cavity. A positive point charge, $+q$, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the entire conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   Electrons will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge, accumulating on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). To find the total charge induced on this inner surface, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the bulk of a conductor must be zero. Therefore, the electric flux through our chosen Gaussian surface is zero.\n    *   Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$) tells us that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must also be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge $(+q)$ and the induced charge on the inner cavity wall $(q_{inner})$.\n    *   So, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface, to maintain overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor. As charges can only reside on surfaces in electrostatics, this $+q$ charge will spread out on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A crucial principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges located inside it. The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor. The configuration inside the cavity (the exact position of the charge $+q$, the off-center location of the cavity, and the resulting non-uniform distribution of the $-q$ charge on the cavity wall) has no effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. Since this outer surface is a perfect sphere (radius R) and there are no other external charges in the problem, this $+q$ charge will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer surface due to symmetry.\n\n6.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** According to the shell theorem (which is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law for spherical symmetry), the electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, let's call it O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from this center O.\n\n7.  **Final Formula:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The other pieces of information given in the problem (the cavity radius $r$, the distance $s$ between the centers, the distance $l$ of P from the cavity's center, and the angle $\\theta$) are irrelevant for finding the field *outside* the conductor. They are distractors meant to test the understanding of the electrostatic shielding principle.\n    *   Option A, B, and C all incorrectly use parameters related to the cavity ($l$, $s$, $\\theta$).\n    *   Option D correctly expresses the electric field based on the total charge induced on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$).\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is given by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
