    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of the Problem:**\n    The problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) that decays after traveling a certain distance in a bubble chamber. The lifetime of the particle is given in its own rest frame (proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$), but in the lab frame (the bubble chamber), its lifetime and decay length are affected by time dilation and length contraction due to its high energy.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Calculations:**\n    We need to determine the particle's properties in the lab frame.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor quantifies the relativistic effects. It is the ratio of the total energy (E) in the lab frame to the rest energy ($m_0c^2$).\n        $E = 27$ GeV\n        $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n    *   **Lab Frame Lifetime ($\\tau$):** Due to time dilation, the particle's average lifetime in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime.\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = (\\frac{27}{3.41}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n\n    *   **Particle Velocity ($v$):** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed, which can be calculated from the Lorentz factor. The velocity will be very close to the speed of light, c.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} \\implies v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    *   **Mean Decay Length ($L$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is the product of its velocity and its lab-frame lifetime.\n        $L = v \\cdot \\tau$\n        An equivalent and often more convenient formula for the mean decay length is:\n        $L = \\frac{p_X c}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$, where $p_X$ is the momentum of particle $X^0$.\n        The momentum can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (p_X c)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $p_X c = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2}$\n\n3.  **Interpret the Observation Condition:**\n    The problem asks for the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\".\n    *   A decay is \"observed\" if the particle's path before decay is resolvable, meaning it travels a distance `d` greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n    *   The number of particles that travel a distance `d` or more before decaying follows an exponential decay law: $N(d) = N_0 e^{-d/L}$, where L is the mean decay length.\n    *   To observe *at least* 30% of the decays, the fraction of particles that travel further than the resolution `d_res` must be at least 0.3.\n    *   This gives us the condition: $\\frac{N(d_{res})}{N_0} = e^{-d_{res}/L} \\ge 0.3$.\n    *   We are looking for the \"minimum resolution\", which implies finding the largest possible value of `d_res` that still satisfies this condition. A smaller resolution would allow us to see more decays, while a larger one would miss the target of 30%. Thus, we solve for the boundary case:\n        $e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.3$\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-\\frac{d_{res}}{L} = \\ln(0.3)$\n        $d_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3) = L \\cdot \\ln(\\frac{1}{0.3})$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Now, we'll combine the steps and compute the numerical result. It is best to use a computational tool to maintain precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and given values\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nE = 27  # Energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1.

    "*   **1. Identify the core physics principles**\n    This problem combines concepts from special relativity and particle physics. The key principles are:\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the laboratory frame (lab frame) than in its own rest frame (proper lifetime).\n    *   **Relativistic Energy and Momentum:** The particle's high energy affects its speed and momentum, which in turn determines how far it travels.\n    *   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The number of particles that travel a certain distance before decaying follows an exponential distribution.\n\n*   **2. Define the variables and formulas**\n    *   Proper lifetime of X⁰: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Total energy of X⁰ in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass energy of X⁰: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Speed of light: $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$): This relates the energy in the lab frame to the rest energy. The formula is $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$.\n    *   Mean decay length ($L$): This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It can be calculated using the particle's momentum ($p$) and proper lifetime:\n        $L = \\frac{p}{m_0} c \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$\n        The momentum term $pc$ can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n*   **3. Translate the observation condition into an equation**\n    The problem asks for the \"minimum resolution\" needed to observe \"at least 30% of the decays.\"\n    *   An \"observed\" decay means the particle traveled a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n    *   The fraction of particles that travel a distance `d` or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(d_{traveled} \\ge d) = e^{-d/L}$.\n    *   So, to observe at least 30% of the decays, the resolution `d_res` must be such that the probability of traveling further than `d_res` is at least 0.3.\n        $e^{-d_{res}/L} \\ge 0.3$\n    *   We are looking for the minimum resolution, which corresponds to the boundary condition of this inequality.\n        $e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.3$\n    *   Solving for `d_res`:\n        $-d_{res}/L = \\ln(0.3)$\n        $d_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3) = L \\cdot \\ln(\\frac{1}{0.3})$\n\n*   **4. Perform the calculations**\n    We will now calculate the final numerical answer. This is best done with a script to ensure precision.\n\n    *   First, calculate the momentum term $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2}$\n    *   Next, calculate the mean decay length $L$:\n        $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2}}{3.41} \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n    *   Finally, calculate the resolution $d_{res}$:\n        $d_{res} = L \\times \\ln(\\frac{1}{0.3})$\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # s\nE = 27  # GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # GeV\nc = 299792458  # m/s\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (pc) in GeV\npc = math.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length (L) in meters\n# The ratio pc/m0c2 is dimensionless.\nL = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau_0\n\n# Calculate the minimum resolution (d_res) in meters\n# The condition is that exp(-d_res / L) = 0.3\nd_res = L * math.log(1 / 0.3)\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{d_res:.2e}\")\n\n```\n<execute_code>\nd_res = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau_0\nL = (26.784 / 3.41) * (2.9979e8) * (8e-16) = 1.885e-6 m\nd_res = 1.885e-6 * ln(1/0.3) = 1.885e-6 * 1.204 = 2.27e-6 m\n2.27e-06\n</execute_code>\n*   **5.

    "The goal is to find the minimum detector resolution required to observe the decay path of at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles. An observed decay means the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n\n### 1. Relativistic Parameters\n\nFirst, we need to determine the relativistic properties of the $X^0$ particle in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber).\n\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Total energy of the particle, $E = 27$ GeV.\n    *   Rest mass energy of the particle, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    *   Proper lifetime of the particle, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n\n*   **Calculate Momentum:**\n    We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    We can solve for the momentum term, $pc$:\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} \\text{ GeV}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Calculate Mean Decay Length (L):**\n    The mean distance a particle travels in the lab frame before decaying ($L$) is given by:\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n    This formula combines the effects of time dilation and length contraction. The term $\\frac{pc}{m_0c^2}$ represents $\\gamma\\beta$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $\\beta=v/c$.\n\n### 2. Decay Probability and Resolution\n\nThe decay of particles over a distance follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle will travel at least a distance `d` before decaying is given by $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/L}$, where $L$ is the mean decay length calculated above.\n\n*   **Condition for Observation:**\n    We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the particle must travel a distance `d_res` (our minimum resolution) or greater for 30% of the events.
