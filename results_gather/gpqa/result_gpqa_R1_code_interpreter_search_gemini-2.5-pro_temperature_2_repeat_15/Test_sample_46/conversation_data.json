    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) plus one additional double bond (like C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)** group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is typical for an **ester C=O group**, especially when it is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from the typical 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) group and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three equivalent protons, typical of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule (n=2) implies it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal, along with the next one, suggests an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two equivalent protons, typical of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule (n=3) implies it is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is highly deshielded. A chemical shift greater than 4.0 ppm for a CH₂ group is characteristic of it being bonded to an oxygen atom in an ester (R-COO-**CH₂**-R').\n    *   **Conclusion:** The signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are very common for protons attached to nitrogen (or oxygen) due to hydrogen bonding and rapid chemical exchange.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.0 ppm):** This shift is consistent with an **amino group (-NH₂)** attached directly to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the -NH₂ group identified in the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (4H total):** Suggests four protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** In a 1,4-disubstituted ring, one substituent is electron-donating, and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n        *   The amino group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, shielding the adjacent protons and shifting them upfield (to a lower ppm value). The signal at **7.0 ppm** is therefore assigned to the two protons ortho to the -NH₂ group.\n        *   The ethyl ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, deshielding the adjacent protons and shifting them downfield (to a higher ppm value). The signal at **8.0 ppm** is therefore assigned to the two protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   An ethyl ester group: -COOCH₂CH₃\n*   A primary amine group: -NH₂\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring to which these two groups are attached.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure has all the required features: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring. It is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. It would have a -CO-CH₂-CH₃ group. The -CH₂- group would appear as a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an amine. The IR would show a single N-H stretch, and the carbonyl would be at a lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹). It would also have only one NH proton in the NMR. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide and is 1,3- (meta) substituted. The NMR aromatic region would show a more complex pattern (not two doublets), and the IR would show amide signals. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound that fits all the provided spectral data (molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR) is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
