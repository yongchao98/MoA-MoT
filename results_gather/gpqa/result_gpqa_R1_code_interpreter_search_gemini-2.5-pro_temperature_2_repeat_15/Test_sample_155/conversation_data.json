    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral due to a C2 axis of symmetry perpendicular to the double bond.\n    ```\n       H         H\n        \\       /\n         C === C\n        /       \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom across the double bond is a **syn-addition**. For a trans-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation can occur from either face of the alkene with equal probability, leading to a racemic mixture of the two possible enantiomeric epoxides.\n        *   Product of this step: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This step causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This reaction proceeds via an **anti-addition** mechanism (SN2-like backside attack).\n        *   Let's consider the opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Anti-attack by water at either C4 or C5 will lead to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Similarly, the opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide by anti-attack will also lead to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two resulting products, (4R,5S)-diol and (4S,5R)-diol, are identical. This molecule has two stereocenters but is achiral because it has a center of inversion (and a plane of symmetry in a specific conformation). This type of compound is called a **meso compound**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n    CH3CH2CH2     H\n        \\       /\n         C === C\n        /       \\\n       H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** The syn-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the product is cis-4,5-epoxyoctane. This molecule has stereocenters (4R, 5S), but it is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry. It is a **meso compound**.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** The acid-catalyzed, anti-addition ring-opening of the meso-epoxide.\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-configuration) inverts its configuration to S. The other center (C5, S-configuration) is unchanged. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at the equivalent C5 (S-configuration) inverts its configuration to R. The other center (C4, R-configuration) is unchanged. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   The two products, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are **enantiomers**. Since the attack on the two carbons of the symmetric meso-epoxide is equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are enantiomers.\n*   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\nThe problem states that the resolution is as high as theoretically possible.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and separate into distinct peaks.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the achiral column will separate the meso-diol from the enantiomeric pair. The enantiomers themselves will not be separated.\n    *   **Result:** Two peaks will be observed.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column can separate all molecules that are not identical. This includes constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n    *   Our mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers: the meso compound and the two enantiomers. All three will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso-diol will be separated from the other two (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated from each other.\n    *   **Result:** Three peaks will be observed.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks in standard HPLC.**\n*   **3 peaks in chiral HPLC.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
