    "This problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and Borane (BH3), when reacting with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. The starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and the products are enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (a lactone).\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A or B):** The name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's deduce its structure. It's a pentanoic acid derivative with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end. At the other end (C5), there is an isobutyl ester group (-CO-O-iBu). An ethyl group is attached at C3. This carbon (C3) is a stereocenter.\n    Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    The stereocenter at C3 is what determines if the molecule is (R) or (S).\n\n*   **Product:** The name is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The ethyl group is at position 4. This carbon (C4) is a stereocenter, and it corresponds to the C3 of the starting material.\n    Structure: A six-membered ring with an oxygen atom (O1) and a carbonyl group at the adjacent position (C2). An ethyl group is on C4.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding that the reactions occur at the functional groups (carboxylic acid and ester) but **do not affect the stereocenter**. The C-H and C-C bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material) are not broken or formed. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R or S) of the starting material is directly retained in the product. An (R) starting material will produce an (R) product, and an (S) starting material will produce an (S) product.\n\nNow let's examine each reaction path:\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent. When reacting with a molecule that has both a carboxylic acid and an ester, it exhibits selectivity. LiBH₄ is basic and will first deprotonate the acidic carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻`). This carboxylate anion is electron-rich and thus resistant to reduction by the nucleophilic hydride (`H⁻`). The ester group, however, remains electrophilic and is readily reduced by LiBH₄ to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `HOOC-R-COO-iBu + LiBH₄` → `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-COO-iBu` (Deprotonation)\n    2.  `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-COO-iBu + LiBH₄` → `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-CH₂OH` (Ester reduction)\n    3.  `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-CH₂OH + H⁺` → `HOOC-R-CH₂OH` (Protonation)\n    This final molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids spontaneously cyclize via intramolecular esterification to form a stable six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As the reaction does not involve the chiral center, its configuration is retained. To produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent highly selective for carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `HOOC-R-COO-iBu + BH₃` → `HOCH₂-R-COO-iBu` (Carboxylic acid reduction to a primary alcohol)\n    The result is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n*   **Cyclization:** The H⁺ in the workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction occurs away from the chiral center, so its configuration is retained. To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
