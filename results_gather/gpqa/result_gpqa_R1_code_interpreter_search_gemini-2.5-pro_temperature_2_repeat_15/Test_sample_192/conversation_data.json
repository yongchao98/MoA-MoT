    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the relationship between the number of stars (let's denote it by `N`) and their parallax (plx): `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the number of stars *per unit range of distance* (let's call this `dN/dr`) and the distance `r`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    *   The astronomical parallax `plx` of a star is defined as being inversely proportional to its distance `r`.\n    *   The standard formula is `plx = 1/r`, where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n    *   Therefore, we have the relationship: `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Find the Cumulative Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   The term \"number of stars\" in this context usually refers to the cumulative count of all stars observed with a parallax *greater* than a certain value `plx`. This is because surveys can detect all stars down to a certain faintness, which corresponds to being within a certain distance `r` (or having a parallax greater than a certain `plx`).\n    *   So, `N` represents the total number of stars with parallax larger than `plx`, which is equivalent to the total number of stars within a distance `r = 1/plx`.\n    *   Let's rewrite the given relationship using `r`.\n    *   We have `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   Substitute `plx ∝ 1/r` into the expression:\n    *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    *   `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    *   `N ∝ r^5`\n    *   This equation tells us that the *cumulative* number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`. Let's write this as `N(r) = C * r^5`, where C is a constant of proportionality.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is the definition of a derivative. We need to find the number of stars within a small shell of distance between `r` and `r + dr`. This quantity is represented by the derivative of the cumulative number `N(r)` with respect to `r`, which is `dN/dr`.\n    *   We differentiate the cumulative function `N(r) = C * r^5` with respect to `r`:\n    *   `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r^5)`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n    *   `dN/dr = 5 * C * r^(5-1)`\n    *   `dN/dr = 5 * C * r^4`\n\n5.  **State the Final Proportionality:**\n    *   From the result of the differentiation, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to `r^4`.\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The result `~ r^4` corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
