    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **List all cobalt species:** In a solution of Co(II) and thiocyanate (SCN⁻), a series of complexes will form. The species are:\n    *   Free (hydrated) cobalt ion: `Co^2+`\n    *   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n    *   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n3.  **Define total cobalt concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n4.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the ligand concentration `[SCN^-]`, and the overall stability constants `β_n`.\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n5.  **Express total cobalt concentration with β values:** Substitute the expressions from step 4 into the equation from step 3:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n    By factoring out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the fraction of the desired species:** The fraction (or distribution coefficient, `α2`) of the dithiocyanato complex is the concentration of that complex divided by the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, which means the total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not needed for this calculation.\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n7.  **Perform the calculation:** Now, plug the given values into the equation:\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n    *   `[SCN^-] = 0.1 M`\n\n    I will use a Python script to ensure an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the alpha2 fraction\nnumerator = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator (sum of all terms)\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*scn_conc**1 + beta2*scn_conc**2 + beta3*scn_conc**3 + beta4*scn_conc**4\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n>>>\n16.91617937494502\n\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.92%. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The percentage of a specific complex species in a solution can be determined by calculating its mole fraction (distribution coefficient, α). The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species.\n\nThe species present in the solution are:\n*   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n*   `[Co(SCN)]^+` (monothiocyanato complex)\n*   `[Co(SCN)2]` (dithiocyanato complex)\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]^-` (trithiocyanato complex)\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-` (tetrathiocyanato complex)\n\nThe total concentration `c(Co)` can be expressed as:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (βn), the concentration of each complex can be related to the free metal ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the ligand concentration `[SCN^-]`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\nBy substituting these into the total concentration equation and factoring out `[Co^2+]`, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α2`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` terms cancel, so the formula simplifies to:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCNow let's plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN^-]` = 0.1 M\n*   β1 = 9\n*   β2 = 40\n*   β3 = 63\n*   β4 = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term 0 (for free `Co^2+`): 1\n*   Term 1 (for `[Co(SCN)]^+`): β1 * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term 2 (for `[Co(SCN)2]`): β2 * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term 3 (for `[Co(SCN)3]⁻`): β3 * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term 4 (for `[Co(SCN)4]²⁻`): β4 * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms:\n`Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is Term 2, which we already calculated:\n`Numerator = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.92%`\n\nThis value matches the one calculated by the Python script and is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
