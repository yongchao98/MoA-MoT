    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data are key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the vinylic region (C=C-H).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O).\n        *   The high symmetry (one proton signal, two carbon signals) and the nature of the precursor (*cis*-dicarboxylic acid) point unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. It has a C₂ᵥ symmetry axis, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The two sp² carbons of the double bond are also equivalent. Thus, we expect one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, which perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Diene:** This is explicitly given as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   This reaction is stereospecific and stereoselective. It typically yields two major stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n    *   **Alder's Endo Rule:** For kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is favored. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the diene and the unsaturated substituents on the dienophile in the transition state. The major product mentioned in the problem is the *endo* adduct, and the minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures (Endo vs. Exo):**\n    *   The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. Let's map the atoms from the reactants to the product:\n        *   The C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead carbons of the product. They each bear a methyl group.\n        *   The C2 and C3 of the diene become the carbons of the new double bond (C5=C6 in standard norbornene nomenclature). They each bear a methyl group.\n        *   The C5 of the diene (a -CH₂- group) becomes the single-carbon C7 bridge.\n        *   The maleic anhydride moiety adds across the diene to form the C2-C3 part of the product, containing the two protons and the fused anhydride ring.\n    *   **The crucial definition of *endo* and *exo* in this system:** The *endo* position is *syn* (on the same face) to the longer bridge, which is the two-carbon C5=C6 bridge with the methyl groups. The *exo* position is *anti* to this bridge (and thus *syn* to the shorter C7 methylene bridge).\n    *   **Major Product (Endo):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C5=C6 double bond. This places the protons of the anhydride part (let's call them H_A) in close spatial proximity to the methyl groups on the double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C5=C6 double bond. This places the H_A protons far from the Me_vinyl groups. Instead, they are close to the protons on the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This must be the correlation that is unique to the *endo* geometry.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis in step 3, the unique spatial proximity in the major (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl).\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in question connects the NMR signals for H_A and Me_vinyl.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match to Options:**\n    *   Let's analyze the signals given in the options based on their integration and typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent anhydride protons (H_A). The chemical shift is reasonable for protons alpha to two carbonyl groups in a strained ring.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl). The shift is characteristic for methyl groups attached to a double bond.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups. Methyl groups on saturated (sp³) carbons typically appear further upfield.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is likely one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product is between H_A (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet).\n    *   This correlation is described in option C.\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls. These are on opposite \"ends\" of the C1-C2-C3-C4 part of the ring and are too far apart.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** A bridge proton and the anhydride protons. This interaction would be characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons. This matches our prediction for the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** The bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. This interaction is plausible but is not the key differentiator between the endo and exo isomers in the same way.\n\nThe correct answer is the option describing the spatial proximity unique to the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
