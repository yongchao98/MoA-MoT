    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions ($[Ca^{2+}]$) in a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equilibrium:**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    The problem deals with a solution of the complex, which will dissociate to a small extent. So, we consider the dissociation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Formation Constant ($K_f$):**\n    The formation constant (also given as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) is defined for the formation reaction:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):**\n    We can set up an ICE table to track the concentrations as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    Now we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplifying Assumption:**\n    The formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), which indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the assumption that:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Solve for x:**\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    Rearranging to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    Now, we perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex in M\n\n# Solve for x^2\n# x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\n# Solve for x, which is the concentration of Ca2+ ions\n# x = sqrt(x^2)\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n7.  **Final Result:**\n    The calculation gives a value for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$, as approximately $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. Comparing this to the options provided:\n    A) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented by the following equilibrium:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nThe formation constant, $K_{f}$, for the complex is given as:\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ ions that form upon dissociation.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is extremely large, the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means the amount of complex that dissociates, x, will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying assumption:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option D.\n\nThe python script also confirmed this calculation:\n$[Ca^{2+}] = \\sqrt{\\frac{[\\text{Ca-EDTA}]_{\\text{initial}}}{K_f}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\n<<<D>>>"
