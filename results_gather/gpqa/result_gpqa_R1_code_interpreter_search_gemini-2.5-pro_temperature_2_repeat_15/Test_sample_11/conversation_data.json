    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** This is a particle decay problem. The fundamental principles that must be satisfied are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Define initial and final states:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A positive pion ($Pi^+$) at rest.\n    *   **Final State:** A positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$). Both are moving.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   **Energy Before:** Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n        *   $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n    *   **Energy After:** The products are moving, so their total energy is the sum of their individual total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy).\n        *   $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} = (m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu}) + (m_{\\nu}c^2 + KE_{\\nu})$\n    *   **Assumption:** In this context, the neutrino's rest mass is considered to be zero ($m_{\\nu} = 0$). Therefore, its rest energy is zero, and its total energy is purely its kinetic energy ($E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$).\n    *   Equating initial and final energy:\n        *   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = (m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu}) + KE_{\\nu}$\n    *   The total kinetic energy of the products is the difference in rest mass energies (the Q-value of the reaction):\n        *   $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n        *   $KE_{total} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    *   **Momentum Before:** The pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero.\n        *   $\\vec{p}_{initial} = 0$\n    *   **Momentum After:** The products move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.\n        *   $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum:\n        *   $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} \\implies \\vec{p}_{\\mu} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    *   This means the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$.\n\n5.  **Calculate Individual Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   We can find the momentum, $p$, of the particles using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n    *   From energy conservation: $E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\mu}$\n    *   For the massless neutrino, $E_{\\nu} = p_{\\nu}c = pc$.\n    *   For the muon, $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$.\n    *   Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n        *   $pc = m_{\\pi}c^2 - \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   Rearranging and solving for $pc$:\n        *   $\\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc$\n        *   Squaring both sides: $(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n        *   $(m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc)$\n        *   $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n        *   $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n    *   This expression gives us the momentum (times c) of each particle. Let's compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest mass energies in MeV (we can treat c=1 for convenience)\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the momentum of the products (in units of MeV/c)\n# The result of this calculation, pc, is in units of MeV.\npc = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its energy, which is pc.\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference in rest masses.\nQ_value = m_pi - m_mu\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is the remaining energy.\nKE_mu = Q_value - KE_nu\n\n# The two kinetic energies are KE_mu and KE_nu.\n# The options list the smaller KE first, which belongs to the more massive particle (the muon).\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of muon: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of neutrino: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n\nThe computed kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon ($mu^+$) and 29.78 MeV (rounded to 29.8 MeV) for the neutrino ($nu$).\n\nComparing these values to the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The decay of a stationary positive pion ($Pi^+$) into a positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$) must obey the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay is the rest mass energy of the stationary pion.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n\n    After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total energy for a particle is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy ($E = mc^2 + KE$).\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} = (m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu}) + (m_{\\nu}c^2 + KE_{\\nu})$\n\n    Equating initial and final energy:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\nu}c^2 + KE_{\\nu}$\n\n    Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible in this context ($m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$).\n    So, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu}$\n\n    The total kinetic energy of the products is the difference between the rest mass energies of the initial and final particles (the Q-value of the reaction):\n    $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\implies p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$\n\n3.  **Relativistic Calculation:**\n    We can relate a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n\n    For the massless neutrino ($m_{\\nu}=0$):\n    $E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + 0 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    Therefore, the neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its total energy: $KE_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n    Now we can find the momentum, $pc$, using the energy conservation equation:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n    To solve for pc:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    Squaring both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Final Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   Kinetic energy of the neutrino:\n        $KE_{\\nu} = pc \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$ (or 29.8 MeV when rounded)\n\n    *   Kinetic energy of the muon:\n        $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
