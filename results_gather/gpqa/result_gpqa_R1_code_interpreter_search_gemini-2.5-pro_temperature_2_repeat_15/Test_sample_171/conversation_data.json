    "The user wants me to identify the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of two stars, $T_1$ and $T_2$, based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\nThe problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a key piece of information because it allows us to use the Boltzmann distribution to describe the population of atoms in different energy levels.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms ($N_j$, $N_i$) in two energy states ($E_j$, $E_i$):\n$$ \\frac{N_j}{N_i} = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\frac{(E_j - E_i)}{kT}} $$\nwhere:\n*   $g_j$ and $g_i$ are the statistical weights of the states (these are constant for a given transition).\n*   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n*   $\\Delta E = E_j - E_i$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n\n**2. Formulate Equations for Each Star**\nLet $R_1$ be the ratio of the number of excited atoms to the number of atoms in a lower state for star_1, and $R_2$ be the same ratio for star_2.\n\nFor star_1 (temperature $T_1$):\n$$ R_1 = \\left(\\frac{g_j}{g_i}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}} $$\nFor star_2 (temperature $T_2$):\n$$ R_2 = \\left(\\frac{g_j}{g_i}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}} $$\nThe term $\\frac{g_j}{g_i}$ is a constant for the specific energy levels of the iron atom being considered, so it's the same for both stars.\n\n**3. Use the Observational Data**\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited ... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n$$ R_1 = 2 \\cdot R_2 $$\nSince $R$ is an exponential function of temperature, this implies that star_1 must be hotter than star_2 ($T_1 > T_2$) to have a higher population in the excited state.\n\nNow, substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{g_j}{g_i}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{g_j}{g_i}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}} $$\nThe constant term $\\left(\\frac{g_j}{g_i}\\right)$ cancels out from both sides:\n$$ e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}} $$\n**4. Solve for the Relationship between Temperatures**\nTo solve for $T_1$ and $T_2$, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(2 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}\\right) $$\nUsing the logarithm properties $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$ and $\\ln(e^x) = x$:\n$$ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) + \\ln\\left(e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}\\right) $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) - \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2} $$\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\ln(2)$ term:\n$$ \\ln(2) = \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} $$\nFactor out the common term $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$:\n$$ \\ln(2) = \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) $$\n**5. Substitute the Given Values**\nThe problem provides the following values:\n*   Energy difference, $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n*   The Boltzmann constant, $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\nThe ratio $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$ is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} = 1 \\text{ K} $$\n(The problem was designed to make this calculation simple).\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation:\n$$ \\ln(2) = 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) $$\nNow, combine the fractions inside the parentheses by finding a common denominator ($T_1 T_2$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{T_1}{T_1 T_2} - \\frac{T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $$\nSo, the final relationship is:\n$$ \\ln(2) = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $$\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
