In this interaction, both total energy and total momentum are conserved.\n\n2.  **Initial State (before collision):**\n    *   Let the rest mass of the electron (and positron) be `m_e` and the speed of light be `c`.\n    *   **Electron:**\n        *   Moves in the +x direction.\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ_e = 4.\n        *   Energy: E_e = γ_e * m_e * c^2 = 4 * m_e * c^2.\n        *   Momentum: The magnitude is given by p = sqrt(E^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2)/c. So, p_e = sqrt((γ_e*m_e*c^2)^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2)/c = sqrt(γ_e^2 - 1) * m_e * c.\n        *   p_e = sqrt(4^2 - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c.\n    *   **Positron:**\n        *   Moves in the -x direction.\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ_p = 2.\n        *   Energy: E_p = γ_p * m_e * c^2 = 2 * m_e * c^2.\n        *   Momentum: The magnitude is p_p = sqrt(γ_p^2 - 1) * m_e * c.\n        *   p_p = sqrt(2^2 - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(3) * m_e * c.\n\n3.  **Final State (after collision):**\n    *   Two photons.\n    *   They have the same energy, let's call it E_γ.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is p_γ = E_γ / c.\n    *   One photon moves upper-right, and the other lower-right. Let's say the first photon moves at an angle `θ` with the x-axis, and the second one at `-θ`. This is because the initial net momentum in the y-direction is zero, so the final net y-momentum must also be zero. Since the photons have equal energy (and thus equal momentum magnitude), their angles must be symmetric around the x-axis.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Energy Conservation:**\n        Total initial energy = Total final energy\n        E_e + E_p = E_γ + E_γ\n        4 * m_e * c^2 + 2 * m_e * c^2 = 2 * E_γ\n        6 * m_e * c^2 = 2 * E_γ\n        E_γ = 3 * m_e * c^2\n\n    *   **Momentum Conservation:**\n        *   The momentum of each photon is p_γ = E_γ / c = (3 * m_e * c^2) / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n        *   **In the y-direction:** The initial momentum is 0. The final momentum is p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-θ) = p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0. This is consistent.\n        *   **In the x-direction:**\n            Total initial x-momentum = Total final x-momentum\n            p_e_x + p_p_x = p_γ1_x + p_γ2_x\n            (sqrt(15) * m_e * c) + (-sqrt(3) * m_e * c) = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ)\n            (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)\n            \n            Substitute the value of p_γ:\n            (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)\n            (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n            \n            Cancel `m_e * c` from both sides:\n            sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)\n            cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n5.  **Calculate the angle:**\n    *   The angle we found, `θ`, is the angle of each photon with the horizontal axis.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`.\n    *   So, the final angle is `2 * arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`.\n    *   We will now use a Python script to compute the numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta) where theta is the angle of one photon with the x-axis\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians using the arccosine function\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# The total angle between the two photons is 2 * theta\ntotal_angle_rad = 2 * theta_rad\n\n# Convert the total angle from radians to degrees\ntotal_angle_deg = math.degrees(total_angle_rad)\n\nprint(f\"{total_angle_deg=}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\ntotal_angle_deg=138.25850937517616\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.26 degrees.
