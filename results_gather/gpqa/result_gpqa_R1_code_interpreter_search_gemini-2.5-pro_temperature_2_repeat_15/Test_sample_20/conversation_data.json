    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (called tautomers) that can be interconverted by the migration of an atom or group, most commonly a proton. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). Its molecular formula is C6H4O2. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp2-hybridized. Keto-enol tautomerism typically involves the removal of a proton from an sp3-hybridized alpha-carbon. While protons can be removed from sp2-carbons, in the case of benzoquinone, this would lead to a highly unstable intermediate. More importantly, for benzoquinone to form an aromatic \"enol\" (which would be hydroquinone), it would need to gain two hydrogen atoms, changing its molecular formula to C6H6O2. Since tautomers must have the same molecular formula, the conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction, not tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. Its molecular formula is C6H6O3. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp3-hybridized and are each situated between two carbonyl groups. These are known as active methylene groups. The hydrogens on these carbons (α-hydrogens) are highly acidic and are readily removed. The compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. The resulting enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which has the same molecular formula (C6H6O3). This enol form is aromatic, making it exceptionally stable. Thus, the equilibrium heavily favors the aromatic enol tautomer. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione clearly exhibits tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a stereocenter, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C-2):\n        *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n        *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3).\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry, so it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers, R and S).\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, and it is the *trans* isomer. This molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so it has no stereocenters. Furthermore, the molecule is symmetrical; it possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
