    "The user is asking to identify which of the listed physical theories does not inherently require a procedure called \"regularization\" to handle problems at high energies (or, equivalently, short distances).\n\n1.  **Understanding Regularization:** In physics, particularly in quantum field theory (QFT), calculations of physical quantities (like scattering amplitudes or corrections to particle masses) often result in infinite values. These infinities typically arise from integrals over all possible energies or momenta of virtual particles in loops, and the divergence comes from the high-energy end of the integral (the \"ultraviolet\" or UV region). Regularization is a mathematical technique to make these infinite integrals temporarily finite by introducing a new, unphysical parameter called a \"regulator\" (e.g., an energy cutoff). After this step, a process called renormalization is used to absorb the infinities into the definitions of physical constants (like mass and charge), yielding finite, physically meaningful predictions.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum theory of light and matter interaction. As a quantum field theory, calculations involving loop diagrams (e.g., the self-energy of the electron) lead to divergent integrals. QED was one of the first theories where the techniques of regularization and renormalization were successfully applied to make fantastically accurate predictions. Therefore, QED *does* require regularization.\n\n    *   **B) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity. Instead of point-like particles, the fundamental entities are one-dimensional \"strings\". A key motivation and feature of superstring theory is that it appears to be free from the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague quantum field theories of point particles. The finite, extended nature of the string \"smears out\" interactions at very short distances, naturally taming the would-be infinities. Perturbative calculations in superstring theory are believed to be finite to all orders, thus not requiring the ad-hoc procedure of regularization.\n\n    *   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, governed by Maxwell's equations, also has a high-energy problem. If you model an electron as a true point charge, the energy of its own electric field (its self-energy) is infinite because the field strength blows up as you approach the point. To avoid this, one must either assign a finite radius to the electron (a form of regularization) or use more advanced classical theories. So, classical electrodynamics with point particles *does* have a divergence at short distances/high energies.\n\n    *   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum field theory describing the strong nuclear force that binds quarks together. Like QED, it is a QFT and its perturbative calculations involving loop diagrams suffer from UV divergences. It relies heavily on regularization and renormalization to be a predictive theory.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Among the choices, Quantum Electrodynamics, Classical Electrodynamics, and Quantum Chromodynamics all exhibit divergences at high energies/short distances that require some form of regularization to manage. Superstring Theory is specifically constructed to avoid this problem and is believed to be a \"UV-complete\" theory, meaning it does not need regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<B>>>"
