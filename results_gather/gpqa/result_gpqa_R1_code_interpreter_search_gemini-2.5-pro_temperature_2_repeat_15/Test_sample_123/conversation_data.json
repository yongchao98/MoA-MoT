    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation from special relativity and the law of radioactive decay.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Radioactive Decay Law:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)\n    where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. Their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than their lifetime in their own rest frame (the proper lifetime, `τ₀`) due to time dilation. The relationship is:\n    τ_lab = γ * τ₀\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R` = 30 m. They travel at a speed `v` which is very close to the speed of light `c` (since they are ultra-relativistic, `v ≈ c`). The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n    t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas:** We can substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation. The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that reach the detector is:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))\n\n    Let's group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` into a single constant `K`, since they do not change between the two scenarios: `K = R / (c * τ₀)`.\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)\n\n5.  **Using the Initial Condition:** We are given that for the first case, `γ₁ = 20` and the fraction of surviving particles is `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor:** Now we need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` required for `N₂/N₀ = 2/3` of the particles to reach the wall.\n    2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n    ln(2) - ln(3) = -K / γ₂\n    -(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -K / γ₂\n    γ₂ = K / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the expression for `K` that we found in step 5:\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\n    We can compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate K from the first condition\n# 1/3 = exp(-K/20) => ln(1/3) = -K/20 => K = 20 * ln(3)\nK = 20 * math.log(3)\n\n# Calculate the new Lorentz factor gamma_2 for the second condition\n# 2/3 = exp(-K/gamma_2) => ln(2/3) = -K/gamma_2 => gamma_2 = -K / ln(2/3)\n# -K / ln(2/3) is equivalent to K / ln(3/2) or K / (ln(3) - ln(2))\ngamma_2 = K / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately 54.18. This value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem involving special relativity and particle decay.\n\n**1. Identify the relevant physical principles:**\n*   **Radioactive Decay Law:** The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive after a time `t` is given by `N/N₀ = exp(-t/τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame where `t` is measured.\n*   **Time Dilation:** A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` has its lifetime `τ₀` (proper lifetime, in its own rest frame) appear dilated to `τ_lab = γ * τ₀` in the lab frame.\n*   **Time of Flight:** The time it takes for a particle to travel a distance `R` at a speed `v` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\", their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, the time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n\n**2. Formulate the governing equation:**\nThe decay happens in the lab frame, so we use the time and lifetime as measured in the lab.\nThe fraction of surviving particles is:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from step 1:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nThe quantities `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` are constant for both scenarios described in the problem. Let's group them into a single constant, `A = R / (c * τ₀)`.\nThe equation simplifies to:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-A / γ)`\n\n**3. Use the information from the first scenario to find the constant `A`:**\n*   Initial Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-A / 20)`\n\nTo solve for `A`, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -A / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -A / 20`\n`A = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**4. Use the constant `A` to solve for the second scenario:**\n*   New fraction of surviving particles, `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`.\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-A / γ₂)`\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -A / γ₂`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -A / γ₂`\n`-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -A / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = A / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n**5. Calculate the final value for `γ₂`:**\nSubstitute the expression for `A` from step 3:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\nNow, I will use Python to compute this numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the first condition, we derive a constant relationship.\n# 1/3 = exp(-A / 20) => ln(1/3) = -A / 20 => A = 20 * ln(3)\n# We don't need to calculate A explicitly yet.\n\n# From the second condition, we want to find gamma_2.\n# 2/3 = exp(-A / gamma_2) => ln(2/3) = -A / gamma_2 => gamma_2 = -A / ln(2/3)\n# We can rewrite -ln(2/3) as ln(3/2) or ln(3) - ln(2).\n# So, gamma_2 = A / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\n# Now substitute the expression for A.\n# gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\nln3 = math.log(3)\nln2 = math.log(2)\n\ngamma_2 = (20 * ln3) / (ln3 - ln2)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe calculation resulted in `54.19022582702909`.\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the calculated value of `γ₂ ≈ 54.19` with the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 28\nC) 40\nD) 54\n\nThe closest option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem relates the survival fraction of decaying particles to their Lorentz factor.\n\n**1. Set up the relevant physics equations:**\n\n*   **Radioactive Decay Law:** The fraction `f` of particles that survive after a time `t` is given by `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t/τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the reference frame where time `t` is measured.\n*   **Time of Flight (in the lab frame):** The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel to the wall. Since they are ultra-relativistic (`v ≈ c`), the time it takes to travel the radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R/c`.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the moving particles as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is dilated from their proper lifetime (`τ₀`, the lifetime in their own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`. The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n\n**2. Combine the equations:**\n\nWe are observing the decay in the lab frame, so we use `t_lab` and `τ_lab` in the decay equation:\n`f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nThe terms `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` are constants for this experiment. Let's group them into a single constant `C = R/(c*τ₀)`. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-C/γ)`\n\n**3. Use the first scenario to determine the constant C:**\n\n*   Given: When the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction `f₁ = 1/3`.\n*   Plugging these values into our equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-C/20)`\n*   To solve for `C`, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -C/20`\n    `-ln(3) = -C/20`\n    `C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**4. Use the constant C to solve for the second scenario:**\n\n*   Goal: Find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` required to have a survival fraction `f₂ = 2/3`.\n*   Using our equation again:\n    `2/3 = exp(-C/γ₂)`\n*   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -C/γ₂`\n*   Solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = -C / ln(2/3)`\n    `γ₂ = -C / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = C / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n*   Now, substitute the expression for `C` that we found in step 3:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n**5. Calculate the numerical value:**\n\nUsing the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`:\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.185`\n\nThis calculation was confirmed by the Python script, which yielded `54.19`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 28\nC) 40\nD) 54\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 54.2 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
