    "This problem requires analyzing spectroscopic and chromatographic data for a synthesized peptide to determine the nature of an impurity or isomerism. Let's break down the evidence step by step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Observation:** The integrals are roughly equal and sum to the expected value of one proton (1H). This indicates a mixture of two species in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemical shifts are similar, suggesting the two species are structurally very similar.\n    *   **Observation:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause. This means the splitting is not due to adjacent protons.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The presence of two distinct signals for the same proton in two different chemical environments that are not coupled to each other strongly suggests the presence of two different molecules, i.e., isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** There are two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). This confirms the presence of two distinct species that can be separated based on their physical/chemical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Observation:** The peaks have equal intensities, reinforcing the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n    *   **Observation:** The mass spectrum (MS) for both peaks is identical and corresponds to the expected molecular weight of the target peptide. This is a crucial piece of information. It means the two species are isomers â€“ they have the same chemical formula and mass, but different arrangements of atoms in space.\n    *   **Observation:** The analysis was run at elevated temperature. This can sometimes cause interconverting isomers (like rotamers) to coalesce into a single peak. The fact that they remain as \"two clearly defined peaks\" suggests a significant energy barrier between the two isomeric forms, or that the separation is very efficient.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a single peak in a standard 1H NMR spectrum and co-elute as a single peak on a standard (achiral) LC column. This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would imply the addition of an extra amino acid or other building block. Such a side product would have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The LC-MS data, showing both peaks have the *same* mass as the expected product, directly contradicts this explanation.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would be a starting material or an intermediate. Like the \"double coupling\" product, it would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and mass from the final product. This is ruled out by the MS data.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point) and are chemically distinct.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** As distinct chemical entities, they would be expected to have different NMR spectra. It is common for diastereomers to show separate sets of peaks, often with similar but not identical chemical shifts, which matches the observation.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography, explaining the two LC peaks. Because they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and mass, explaining why both peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n        *   **Plausible Origin:** Diastereomers can arise in peptide synthesis if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks was not enantiomerically pure (i.e., a mix of D and L forms was used) or, very commonly, from cis-trans isomerism about a proline amide bond. Both scenarios would lead to a mixture of diastereomers which perfectly fits all the given experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of a diastereomeric mixture is the only explanation that is fully consistent with all the observations from both NMR and LC-MS analyses.\n\n<<<D>>>"
