    "This problem requires us to identify which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. The most severe mutations are those that cause a drastic change in the protein structure, such as introducing a premature stop codon or causing a frameshift.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to completely eliminate the function of a gene. This is best achieved by creating a \"knockout\" mutation. The most effective types of mutations for this purpose are:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A point mutation that changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes translation to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated and usually non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame of the gene, scrambling the entire amino acid sequence downstream from the mutation and often leading to an early, non-functional stop codon.\n\n2.  **Examine the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   The sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`. `ATG` is the universal start codon, coding for the amino acid Methionine (Met).\n    *   The sequence is given in codons (groups of three nucleotides) for translation into amino acids.\n    *   Intact Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...`\n    *   Translated Protein: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...`\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** Let's compare each mutant to the intact gene and predict the impact on the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n        *   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`. `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a **synonymous (silent) mutation**. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**.\n        *   Impact: A single amino acid change (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function but is unlikely to completely eliminate it.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n        *   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, silent). The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAA`.\n        *   Impact: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause the ribosome to stop translation after the second amino acid. The resulting protein will only be a dipeptide (Met-Phe). This product is almost certain to be completely non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...`\n        *   Comparison: This mutant contains multiple changes. `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further downstream, `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n        *   Impact: These are two **missense mutations**, changing two amino acids in the protein. While this could significantly alter the protein, it's not as certain to cause a complete loss of function as a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...`\n        *   Comparison: When aligned with the intact sequence, it appears that the codon `GGT` has been deleted, and the codon `CTC` has changed to `TAC`.\n        *   Intact: `...TTC CTC GCT **GGT** ACT TCT...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `...TTT TAC GCT --- ACT TCT...`\n        *   Impact: This represents both a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of exactly 3 nucleotides). An in-frame deletion removes one amino acid (Glycine in this case) but leaves the rest of the downstream reading frame intact. The resulting protein will be one amino acid shorter but otherwise unchanged. This is less disruptive than a frameshift or a premature stop codon.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene's coding sequence. This will lead to the synthesis of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way among the given options to eliminate the protein's function and, therefore, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTo confirm the translations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\ndef translate_dna(dna_sequence):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence.\"\"\"\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATG': 'Met', 'TTT': 'Phe', 'TTC': 'Phe', 'TTA': 'Leu', 'TTG': 'Leu',\n        'CTT': 'Leu', 'CTC': 'Leu', 'CTA': 'Leu', 'CTG': 'Leu', 'ATT': 'Ile',\n        'ATC': 'Ile', 'ATA': 'Ile', 'GTT': 'Val', 'GTC': 'Val', 'GTA': 'Val',\n        'GTG': 'Val', 'TCT': 'Ser', 'TCC': 'Ser', 'TCA': 'Ser', 'TCG': 'Ser',\n        'CCT': 'Pro', 'CCC': 'Pro', 'CCA': 'Pro', 'CCG': 'Pro', 'ACT': 'Thr',\n        'ACC': 'Thr', 'ACA': 'Thr', 'ACG': 'Thr', 'GCT': 'Ala', 'GCC': 'Ala',\n        'GCA': 'Ala', 'GCG': 'Ala', 'TAT': 'Tyr', 'TAC': 'Tyr', 'TAA': 'STOP',\n        'TAG': 'STOP', 'CAT': 'His', 'CAC': 'His', 'CAA': 'Gln', 'CAG': 'Gln',\n        'AAT': 'Asn', 'AAC': 'Asn', 'AAA': 'Lys', 'AAG': 'Lys', 'GAT': 'Asp',\n        'GAC': 'Asp', 'GAA': 'Glu', 'GAG': 'Glu', 'TGT': 'Cys', 'TGC': 'Cys',\n        'TGA': 'STOP', 'TGG': 'Trp', 'CGT': 'Arg', 'CGC': 'Arg', 'CGA': 'Arg',\n        'CGG': 'Arg', 'AGT': 'Ser', 'AGC': 'Ser', 'AGA': 'Arg', 'AGG': 'Arg',\n        'GGT': 'Gly', 'GGC': 'Gly', 'GGA': 'Gly', 'GGG': 'Gly'\n    }\n    protein_sequence = []\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_sequence) - (len(dna_sequence) % 3), 3):\n        codon = dna_sequence[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, 'X')\n        protein_sequence.append(amino_acid)\n        if amino_acid == 'STOP':\n            break\n    return \"-\".join(protein_sequence)\n\nintact_seq = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant1_seq = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\nmutant2_seq = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\nmutant3_seq = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant4_seq = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\nprint(\"Intact protein:\", translate_dna(intact_seq))\nprint(\"Mutant 1 protein:\", translate_dna(mutant1_seq))\nprint(\"Mutant 2 protein:\", translate_dna(mutant2_seq))\nprint(\"Mutant 3 protein:\", translate_dna(mutant3_seq))\nprint(\"Mutant 4 protein:\", translate_dna(mutant4_seq))\n\n```\nExecution of the code confirms the manual analysis:\n*   Intact: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser-Val-Asp-Glu-His-Ile-Tyr-Cys-Arg\n*   Mutant 1: Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser-Val-Asp-Glu-His-Ile-Tyr-Cys-Arg\n*   Mutant 2: Met-Phe-**STOP**\n*   Mutant 3: Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Gly-**Val**-**Thr**-Ser-Val-Asp-Glu-His-Ile-Tyr-Cys-Arg\n*   Mutant 4: Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Thr-Ser-Val-Asp-Glu-His-Ile-Tyr-Cys-Arg\n\nThe result for Mutant 2 clearly shows premature termination, which is the most effective at knocking out gene function.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The goal is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound by making the gene that produces it non-functional. The most effective way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that causes the most drastic change to the resulting protein, such as completely stopping its production early on.\n\nLet's break down the genetic code and translate the sequences for the intact gene and each mutant. Translation starts at the `ATG` codon and proceeds in groups of three nucleotides (codons).\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    This sequence produces the full-length, functional protein that synthesizes the unwanted compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...\n    *   Change: The original second codon `TTT` (Phe) becomes `TTC` (also Phe) - this is a silent mutation. The third codon `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAC` (Tyr).\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala...\n    *   Effect: This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAA`.\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   Effect: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long and will be completely non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...\n    *   Change: Contains a missense mutation where `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAC` (Tyr) and another missense mutation further down where `ACT` (Thr) becomes `GTC` (Val).\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n    *   Effect: Two missense mutations. This increases the chance of disrupting protein function compared to a single missense mutation, but it is still less certain than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAC` (Tyr) and the fifth codon `GGT` (Gly) has been deleted.\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Thr... (Gly is missing)\n    *   Effect: This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of exactly one codon). The protein is produced but is missing one amino acid. This might affect its function, but it's not as severe as a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon, which will terminate protein synthesis very early. This is the most reliable way to produce a completely non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the unwanted compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
