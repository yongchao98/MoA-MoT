    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectral data:**\n    *   The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14.\n    *   The mixture is equimolar (1:1).\n    *   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectra of the individual candidate compounds:**\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   Molecular Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry both horizontally and vertically through the ring.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce one singlet signal. Integral: 2H.\n        *   Alkyl Protons: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce one singlet signal. Integral: 12H.\n        *   *Summary of Durene spectrum:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   Molecular Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C5 axis.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They will produce one singlet signal. Integral: 2H.\n        *   Alkyl Protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n            1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. This gives one singlet. Integral: 6H.\n            2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives a second singlet. Integral: 3H.\n            3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique. This gives a third singlet. Integral: 3H.\n        *   *Summary of Isodurene spectrum:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; ratio 2:1:1).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   Molecular Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: There is a C2 axis of symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other and are not chemically equivalent. They will couple, resulting in a pair of doublets (an AB system), not singlets.\n        *   *Conclusion:* This compound can be eliminated because it would not produce only singlets in the aromatic region.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   Molecular Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: Highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: All four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing one singlet. Integral: 4H.\n        *   Alkyl Protons: The ethyl groups consist of CH2 and CH3 protons. Due to spin-spin coupling, the CH2 signal will be a quartet and the CH3 signal will be a triplet.\n        *   *Conclusion:* This compound can be eliminated because the problem states that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum:**\n\n    *   Options B, C, and D can be immediately ruled out.\n        *   Options B and D include 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which would show doublets, not singlets, in the aromatic region.\n        *   Option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet, not only singlets, in the alkyl region.\n\n    *   This leaves **Option A** as the only possibility. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene matches the described spectrum.\n\n4.  **Analyze the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture in Option A:**\n    *   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene).\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Isodurene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Since they are different compounds, their aromatic protons will likely have slightly different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio)**. This perfectly matches the problem description.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet with a relative integration of 12H.\n        *   Isodurene contributes three singlets with relative integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   In total, we have four distinct signals from the methyl groups with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The problem states that only **three singlets** are observed with a **2:1:1 ratio**. This implies an accidental overlap of signals.\n        *   Let's check what kind of overlap would produce a 2:1:1 ratio. The total integration in the alkyl region corresponds to 24 protons (12 from Durene, 12 from Isodurene). A 2:1:1 ratio means the integrals of the observed peaks are proportional to 2x, 1x, and 1x. The total is 4x. So, 4x = 24H, which means x = 6H. The observed signals must have integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n        *   How can we get these from the individual signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H)?\n            *   The 12H signal comes from Durene.\n            *   The 6H signal comes from the C1/C3 methyls of Isodurene.\n            *   To get the second 6H signal, the two 3H signals from the C2 and C5 methyls of Isodurene must have the same chemical shift (accidental degeneracy) and therefore overlap into a single peak.\n        *   This scenario results in three peaks with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
