    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to determine the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The temperature of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. The formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet in a circular orbit is:\n        `T_eq = [L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d^2)]^(1/4)`\n        where `L` is the star's luminosity, `A` is the planet's albedo, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and `d` is the orbital distance from the star.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its orbital distance (`d`). For planets orbiting the same star, the law can be simplified to a proportionality:\n        `P^2 ∝ d^3`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   The planets orbit the same star, so the stellar luminosity (`L`) is constant for all three.\n    *   The albedo (`A`) is the same for all three planets (A = 0.3).\n    *   The values of `π` and `σ` are physical constants.\n    *   The temperature ratios are given: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4` and `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`.\n    *   The mass ratios are also given, but as we'll see, they are not needed for this calculation, as the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass in Kepler's Third Law.\n\n4.  **Establish a Relationship between Period (P) and Temperature (T_eq):**\n    *   From the equilibrium temperature formula, since `L`, `A`, `π`, and `σ` are constant, we can establish a relationship between `T_eq` and `d`:\n        `T_eq ∝ (1 / d^2)^(1/4)`\n        `T_eq ∝ 1 / d^(1/2)`\n    *   Rearranging this for `d`, we get:\n        `d ∝ 1 / T_eq^2`\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law, `P ∝ d^(3/2)`.\n    *   Now, substitute the expression for `d` into the relationship for `P`:\n        `P ∝ (1 / T_eq^2)^(3/2)`\n        `P ∝ 1 / T_eq^3`\n    *   This crucial relationship shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Ratios:**\n    *   We want to find the ratio `P3 / P1`. Using the proportionality we just derived:\n        `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3`\n    *   We need to find the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3`. We can find this by multiplying the given ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)`\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3`\n    *   Now, substitute this back into the period ratio equation:\n        `P3 / P1 = (1.4 * 2.3)^3`\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   Let's perform the calculation using a simple Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given temperature ratios\nT_eq1_div_T_eq2 = 1.4\nT_eq2_div_T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n# The relationship between Period (P) and Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) is P ∝ 1 / (T_eq^3).\n# Therefore, P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3.\n\n# First, calculate the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3.\nT_eq1_div_T_eq3 = T_eq1_div_T_eq2 * T_eq2_div_T_eq3\n\n# Now, calculate the period ratio P3 / P1 by cubing the temperature ratio.\nperiod_ratio_P3_P1 = math.pow(T_eq1_div_T_eq3, 3)\n\nprint(f\"{period_ratio_P3_P1:.1f}\")\n```\nExecution of the code provides the final result. The calculated value is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 (P3/P1), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = [L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d^2)]^(1/4)`\n    where `L` is the star's luminosity, `A` is the albedo, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and `d` is the orbital distance.\n    Since `L`, `A`, `π`, and `σ` are the same for all three planets, we can see the relationship between temperature and distance:\n    `T_eq ∝ (1/d^2)^(1/4)`\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / d^(1/2)`\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance:**\n    According to Kepler's Third Law, for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`d`):\n    `P^2 ∝ d^3`\n    or\n    `P ∝ d^(3/2)`\n\n3.  **Combine the Relationships to Relate Period and Temperature:**\n    First, let's express the distance `d` in terms of temperature `T_eq` from the relationship in step 1:\n    `d^(1/2) ∝ 1 / T_eq  =>  d ∝ 1 / T_eq^2`\n    Now, substitute this expression for `d` into the Kepler's Law relationship from step 2:\n    `P ∝ (1 / T_eq^2)^(3/2)`\n    `P ∝ 1 / T_eq^3`\n    This means the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the ratio of the periods P3 to P1 can be written as:\n    `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3:**\n    We are given the individual ratios:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n    *   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n    To find `T_eq1 / T_eq3`, we can multiply these two ratios:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio:**\n    Now substitute the temperature ratio back into the equation from step 3:\n    `P3 / P1 = (3.22)^3`\n    `P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386`\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. (Note that the given mass ratios and albedo value were not needed for this calculation, as the albedo was equal for all planets and planetary masses are typically negligible in Kepler's third law when orbiting a much more massive star).\n\nThe calculation confirms that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
