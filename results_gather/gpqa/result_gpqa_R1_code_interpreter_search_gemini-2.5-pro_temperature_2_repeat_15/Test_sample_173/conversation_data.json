    "This problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment produced in a spontaneous fission process, once using relativistic mechanics and once using classical mechanics, and then find the difference.\n\n### 1. Understand the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its total energy is its rest-mass energy, and its initial momentum is zero.\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2m2` (let `m1` be the more massive fragment).\n    *   We are also given that the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\n\nWe can solve for the individual masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\nSubstitute `m1 = 2m2` into the second equation:\n`2m2 + m2 = 0.99M`\n`3m2 = 0.99M`\n`m2 = 0.33M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2m2 = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (more massive): `E1_rest = m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (less massive): `E2_rest = m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe total rest-mass energy of the fragments is `E_final_rest = 198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nThe difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the Q-value of the fission.\n`Q = T_total = T1 + T2 = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum.\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p_cl`.\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n*   `T1_cl = p_cl^2 / (2m1)`\n*   `T2_cl = p_cl^2 / (2m2)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of their kinetic energies:\n`T1_cl / T2_cl = (p_cl^2 / 2m1) / (p_cl^2 / 2m2) = m2 / m1 = 0.33M / 0.66M = 1/2`\nThis means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 using correct (relativistic) mechanics\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (`E`), rest-mass energy (`mc^2`), and momentum (`p`) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\nThe total energy `E` is also the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy: `E = T + mc^2`.\nSubstituting this into the energy-momentum relation gives:\n`(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2T(mc^2) + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\n`(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`\n\nFrom conservation of momentum, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal: `p1 = p2`. Therefore, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, so `T2 = 3 - T1`. We also have the rest-mass energies `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. We substitute these into the equation. For simplicity, we'll omit the units (GeV) during the calculation.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + T1^2 + 594 - 198*T1`\n\nCancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nThis is the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 6. Calculate the difference\n\nNow we find the difference between the correct value (`T1`) and the classically approximated value (`T1_cl`).\n`Difference = T1 - T1_cl`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# Initial values\nE_initial_rest = 300  # GeV\n\n# Calculate rest energies of the fragments\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M => 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => m2 = 0.33 * M\n# m1 = 0.66 * M\nE1_rest = 0.66 * E_initial_rest  # GeV (more massive fragment)\nE2_rest = 0.33 * E_initial_rest  # GeV (less massive fragment)\n\n# Total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nQ = E_initial_rest - (E1_rest + E2_rest)  # GeV\n\n# 1. Classical calculation of T1\n# T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = 1/2 => T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = Q => T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = Q => 3*T1_cl = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0  # GeV\n\n# 2. Relativistic calculation of T1\n# Derived from (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2:\n# 600 * T1_relativistic = 603\n# T1_relativistic = 603 / 600\n# Alternative formula derived in thought process: T1 = Q * (Q + 2*E2_rest) / (2 * E_initial_rest)\nT1_relativistic = Q * (Q + 2 * E2_rest) / (2 * E_initial_rest) # GeV\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference_gev = T1_relativistic - T1_classical # GeV\n\n# Convert difference to MeV\ndifference_mev = difference_gev * 1000 # MeV\n\nprint(f\"{difference_mev:.1f}\")\n```\n\n5.0\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus with rest mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Initial total energy `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Let `m1` be the more massive fragment. We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the fragment rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate Rest Masses and Rest Energies of Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments using the initial rest-mass energy `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n    `E1_rest = m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`):\n    `E2_rest = m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments (`T_total = T1 + T2`). This energy comes from the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n\n`Q = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest`\n`E_final_rest = E1_rest + E2_rest = 198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n`p1 = p2 = p_cl`\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_cl = p_cl^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_cl = p_cl^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of their kinetic energies:\n`T1_cl / T2_cl = (p_cl^2 / 2m1) / (p_cl^2 / 2m2) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n\nNow, use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\nSo, the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **1 GeV**.\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nAgain, we use the conservation of momentum: `p1 = p2 = p_rel`.\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between a particle's total energy `E`, rest-mass energy `m0*c^2`, and momentum `p` is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m0*c^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + m0*c^2`, where `T` is the kinetic energy.\n\nWe can express the momentum-energy relation in terms of kinetic energy:\n`(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m0*c^2)^2 = (T + m0*c^2)^2 - (m0*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m0*c^2)`\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, it follows that `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`. Let `T1` and `T2` be the correct relativistic kinetic energies.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(E1_rest) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(E2_rest)`\n\nWe have the following values (in GeV):\n*   `E1_rest = 198`\n*   `E2_rest = 99`\n*   `T1 + T2 = 3` => `T2 = 3 - T1`\n\nSubstitute these into the momentum equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nCancel the `T1^2` term from both sides:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **1.005 GeV**.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_cl`) and express it in MeV.\n\n`Difference = T1 - T1_cl = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nConvert this value to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# Initial rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus\nE_initial = 300.0  # in GeV\n\n# The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# Let E1_rest and E2_rest be the rest energies of the fragments.\n# E1_rest + E2_rest = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 = 297 GeV\n\n# One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other.\n# m1 = 2 * m2 => E1_rest = 2 * E2_rest\n# Substituting this into the sum:\n# 2 * E2_rest + E2_rest = 297 => 3 * E2_rest = 297\nE2_rest = 297.0 / 3.0  # GeV\nE1_rest = 2.0 * E2_rest   # GeV (This is the more massive fragment)\n\n# The total kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between initial and final rest energies.\nQ = E_initial - (E1_rest + E2_rest) # GeV\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) ---\n# In classical mechanics, T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2 => T2 = 2*T1\n# T1 + T2 = Q => T1 + 2*T1 = Q => 3*T1 = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0 # GeV\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# From conservation of momentum p1=p2, we have (p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2.\n# Using (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m0*c^2), we get:\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*E1_rest = T2^2 + 2*T2*E2_rest\n# And we know T2 = Q - T1.\n# After substitution and algebra (as shown in the reasoning), we get:\n# T1 * (2*E_initial) = Q * (Q + 2*E2_rest)\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2 * E2_rest)) / (2 * E_initial) # GeV\n\n# --- Calculate the difference ---\ndifference_gev = T1_relativistic - T1_classical # in GeV\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_mev = difference_gev * 1000.0\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_mev:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n\n<<<D>>>",
