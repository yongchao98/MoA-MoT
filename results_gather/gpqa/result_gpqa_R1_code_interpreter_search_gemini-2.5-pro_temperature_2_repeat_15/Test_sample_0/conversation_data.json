    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to its energy. This relationship is governed by the time-energy formulation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n    \n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    \n    For practical calculations of energy level widths, this is often approximated as:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\n3.  **Relate the Principle to the Problem**:\n    *   The \"uncertainty in time\" (Δt) for an unstable quantum state is its lifetime (τ).\n    *   The \"uncertainty in energy\" (ΔE) is the natural energy width of the state. A state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy, but rather an energy spread or width.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**:\n    *   For the first state: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s. Its energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁.\n    *   For the second state: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s. Its energy width is ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂.\n    *   Note that the state with the *shorter* lifetime (state 1) will have the *larger* energy width, making it the more significant factor for resolution.\n\n5.  **Establish the Condition for Resolution**: To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₂ - E₁|, must be greater than their combined energy widths. Think of this like trying to distinguish two broad peaks on a graph; their centers must be separated by more than their combined spread.\n    \n    Condition for resolution: |E₂ - E₁| > (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂)\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation**: We need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s to get the energy in electron volts (eV).\n    \n    ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    \n    Now, let's calculate the required energy separation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Value of the reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar = 6.582119569e-16  # eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two quantum states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (dE = h_bar / tau)\ndelta_E1 = h_bar / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between them\n# must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.\nrequired_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (dE1): {delta_E1:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (dE2): {delta_E2:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required energy difference for resolution (dE1 + dE2): {required_energy_difference:.2e} eV\")\n\n# Let's check the given options:\n# A) 1e-4 eV\n# B) 1e-11 eV\n# C) 1e-8 eV\n# D) 1e-9 eV\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing the options to the required energy difference:\")\nprint(f\"A) 1e-4 eV > {required_energy_difference:.2e} eV: {1e-4 > required_energy_difference}\")\nprint(f\"B) 1e-11 eV > {required_energy_difference:.2e} eV: {1e-11 > required_energy_difference}\")\nprint(f\"C) 1e-8 eV > {required_energy_difference:.2e} eV: {1e-8 > required_energy_difference}\")\nprint(f\"D) 1e-9 eV > {required_energy_difference:.2e} eV: {1e-9 > required_energy_difference}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (dE1): 6.58e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (dE2): 6.58e-08 eV\nRequired energy difference for resolution (dE1 + dE2): 7.24e-07 eV\n\nComparing the options to the required energy difference:\nA) 1e-4 eV > 7.24e-07 eV: True\nB) 1e-11 eV > 7.24e-07 eV: False\nC) 1e-8 eV > 7.24e-07 eV: False\nD) 1e-9 eV > 7.24e-07 eV: False\n```\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The calculation shows that to clearly resolve these two states, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. We need to check the given options to see which one satisfies this condition.\n\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller (since 10⁻⁸ = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷).\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem is governed by the time-energy formulation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of an unstable state to the uncertainty (or width) of its energy level. The principle is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor calculations involving the energy width of a state, we can use the approximation:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the energy width of the quantum state.\n*   τ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguishable,\" the difference in their energies, |E₂ - E₁|, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths. This ensures that the two broadened energy distributions do not overlap significantly.\n\nResolution condition: |E₂ - E₁| > (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂)\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy width for each state.**\n\n*   For the first state (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s):\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   For the second state (τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s):\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the minimum required energy difference for resolution.**\n\nThe minimum energy difference is the sum of the widths:\nRequired difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nRequired difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nRequired difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nRequired difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**Step 3: Compare the required difference with the given options.**\n\nWe need to find the option that is greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV. This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV.
