    "This problem requires an understanding of the nuclear reactions that power the Sun, specifically the different branches of the proton-proton (pp) chain and the energy spectra of the neutrinos they produce.\n\n**1. The Proton-Proton Chain and its Branches**\n\nThe Sun's energy comes primarily from the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III). All branches start with the same initial reactions to produce Helium-4 from protons, but they diverge in the intermediate steps.\n\n*   **Initial Steps (common to all branches):**\n    `p + p → d + e+ + νe` (producing \"pp\" neutrinos)\n    `d + p → ³He + γ`\n*   **Divergence Point:** After ³He is formed, the chain can proceed in three ways. The key is what happens to Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`), which is formed by `³He + ⁴He → ⁷Be + γ`.\n\n    *   **pp-II Branch:** `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe`. This reaction produces a neutrino with a distinct, single energy (a \"line\"). The most prominent line is at **861 keV**. This branch accounts for about 14% of the Sun's energy production.\n\n    *   **pp-III Branch:** `⁷Be + p → ⁸B + γ`, followed by `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe`. This branch produces the high-energy \"Boron-8\" (`⁸B`) neutrinos. These neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to ~15 MeV. This branch is very rare, but it is the source of the highest-energy solar neutrinos.\n\n**2. The Hypothetical Scenario**\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. The time delay of 8.5 minutes is given to indicate that we on Earth are now observing the immediate consequences of this change in the Sun's core.\n\n*   **What stops?** The production of `⁸B` stops. Consequently, the production of `⁸B` **neutrinos ceases**.\n*   **What continues?** The problem explicitly states that \"all other reactions remained as they were\". This is crucial. It means the pp-I and, most importantly, the **pp-II branch continue to operate normally**. This implies that the production of `⁷Be` neutrinos is unaffected.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Neutrino Flux in the Given Energy Bands**\n\nNow, let's look at the sources of neutrinos in the two energy bands specified:\n\n*   **Band 1 (700 keV - 800 keV):**\n    *   Before the change, the primary source of neutrinos in this energy range was the continuous spectrum of the **`⁸B` neutrinos**.\n    *   After the pp-III branch stops, there are no `⁸B` neutrinos. There are no other significant sources of neutrinos in this specific energy window (the pp neutrinos are below 420 keV, and the `⁷Be` line is outside this band).\n    *   Therefore, the flux in Band 1 drops to essentially zero. Flux(Band 1) ≈ 0.\n\n*   **Band 2 (800 keV - 900 keV):**\n    *   Before the change, this band received neutrinos from two sources: the continuous spectrum of `⁸B` neutrinos and the very strong, discrete line of **`⁷Be` neutrinos at 861 keV** (produced by the pp-II branch).\n    *   After the pp-III branch stops, the `⁸B` component disappears. However, the **`⁷Be` neutrino line at 861 keV remains unchanged**, as the pp-II branch is unaffected.\n    *   Therefore, the flux in Band 2 remains significant and is now dominated by the `⁷Be` neutrinos. Flux(Band 2) > 0.\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratio**\n\nWe need to calculate the ratio: Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).\n\n*   Flux(Band 1) ≈ 0\n*   Flux(Band 2) = (Flux from `⁷Be` neutrinos) > 0\n\nRatio = (Flux(Band 1)) / (Flux(Band 2)) ≈ 0 / (Flux from `⁷Be`) ≈ 0\n\nLooking at the options provided:\nA) 10.\nB) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nC) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\nD) 1.\n\nThe value closest to our calculated result of approximately zero is **B) 0.01**. The flux in the 700-800 keV band isn't perfectly zero due to minor contributions and the tail-ends of other reactions, but it is vastly smaller than the flux in the 800-900 keV band which contains the powerful and unaffected `⁷Be` line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
