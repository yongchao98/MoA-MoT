    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of the signals given in the 1H NMR data to determine the total number of protons in the molecule.\n- Signal 1: 1H\n- Signal 2: 1H\n- Signal 3: 3H\n- Signal 4: 3H\n- **Total Protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 Protons**\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible compounds:\n- **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** 8 protons. This matches our data.\n- **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** 10 protons. This does not match our data.\n\nBased on the proton count, we can immediately eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (A) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Individual Signals**\n\nLet's look at the structure of propenyl acetate: `CH₃(a)-C(=O)-O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d)`. There are four distinct proton environments, which corresponds to the four signals observed in the spectrum.\n\n*   **`2.1 ppm (3H, s)`:**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents three protons, consistent with a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the acetyl methyl group, `CH₃(a)`.\n\n*   **The remaining signals (`7.0`, `5.5`, `1.6` ppm) must belong to the propenyl group `(-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d))`.**\n\n*   **`1.6 ppm (3H, d)`:**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a CH₃ group.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means it is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal is the propenyl methyl group, `CH₃(d)`, which is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton `H(c)`.\n\n*   **`7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)` and `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`:** These two signals are for the two protons on the double bond (vinyl protons), `H(b)` and `H(c)`.\n    *   **Proton `H(b)`:** This proton (`-O-CH(b)=`) is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it, causing it to appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield). It is coupled to proton `H(c)`.\n    *   **Proton `H(c)`:** This proton (`=CH(c)-CH₃`) is coupled to proton `H(b)` (making it a doublet) and to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group `CH₃(d)` (making it a quartet). The combination of these splittings results in a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n    *   **Assignment:**\n        *   The signal at `7.0 ppm` is proton `H(b)`. It is a doublet because it's only split by `H(c)`.\n        *   The signal at `5.5 ppm` is proton `H(c)`. Its splitting is correctly described as a `dq`.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinyl protons, `H(b)` and `H(c)`.\n*   The signal at `7.0 ppm` for `H(b)` is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the interaction between `H(b)` and `H(c)`.\n\n*   The established rules for vinyl proton coupling are:\n    *   **Trans coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond):** `J_trans` is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond):** `J_cis` is typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data indicates a propenyl acetate structure with a trans geometry at the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
