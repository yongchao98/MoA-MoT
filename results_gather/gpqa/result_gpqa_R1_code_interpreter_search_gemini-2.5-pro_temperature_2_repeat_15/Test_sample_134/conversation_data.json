    "The user wants to determine the kinematically allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Decay**\n\nThe Lagrangian density given is:\n$\\mathcal{L}\\left(y\\right)=-\\lambda{f}\\bar{\\psi}{f}\\left(y\\right)\\left(\\upsilon+X\\left(y\\right)\\right)\\psi_{f}\\left(y\\right)$\n\nThis describes the interaction between the boson X and fermions $\\psi_f$. The term relevant for the decay is the interaction term $-\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f X \\psi_f$. This term indicates that the boson X can decay into a pair of a fermion and its corresponding anti-fermion, denoted as $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\n**2. Kinematic Constraint**\n\nFor a decay to be \"kinematically allowed\", the mass of the decaying particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products.\n\nFor the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$:\n$m_X \\ge m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}$\n\nSince a particle and its anti-particle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$m_X \\ge 2 \\cdot m_f$\n\nGiven that the mass of the boson X is $m_X = 6$ GeV, the condition for any fermion $f$ is:\n$6 \\text{ GeV} \\ge 2 \\cdot m_f$\nor\n$m_f \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nTherefore, the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass of the fermion is less than or equal to 3 GeV.\n\n**3. Check Fermion Masses**\n\nWe need to check the masses of all fundamental fermions (quarks and charged leptons) to see which ones satisfy this condition.

Conclusion**\n\nThe kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson X at the lowest order are into fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV.

    "<information>## The Mass of Quarks and Leptons: A Fundamental Property of Matter\n\nThe masses of quarks and leptons, the fundamental building blocks of matter, are key parameters in the Standard Model of particle physics. These masses are expressed in units of giga-electron-volts (GeV), a unit of energy that can be converted to mass through Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².\n\n### Quark Masses\n\nQuarks are fundamental particles that combine to form composite particles called hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. There are six \"flavors\" of quarks, grouped into three generations. Their approximate masses are:\n\n*   **Up Quark:** ~0.0022 GeV\n*   **Down Quark:** ~0.0047 GeV\n*   **Charm Quark:** ~1.27 GeV\n*   **Strange Quark:** ~0.095 GeV\n*   **Top Quark:** ~173 GeV\n*   **Bottom Quark:** ~4.18 GeV\n\nIt is important to note that quarks are never found in isolation due to a phenomenon called color confinement. The masses listed are the \"current\" or \"bare\" masses of the quarks themselves. When they are part of a hadron, their effective mass, known as the \"constituent quark mass,\" is significantly larger due to the energy of the gluon field that binds them together. For instance, the three valence quarks in a proton only contribute about 9 MeV/c² to its total mass of approximately 938 MeV/c².\n\n### Lepton Masses\n\nLeptons are another class of fundamental particles that includes the electron, muon, tau, and their corresponding neutrinos. Like quarks, they are grouped into three generations.\n\n**Charged Leptons:**\n\n*   **Electron (e):** 0.000511 GeV\n*   **Muon (μ):** 0.1057 GeV\n*   **Tau (τ):** 1.777 GeV\n\nThe electron is the lightest and most stable of the charged leptons. The heavier muon and tau particles are unstable and quickly decay into lighter particles.\n\n**Neutral Leptons (Neutrinos):**\n\nNeutrinos are much lighter than their charged counterparts, and their exact masses are still a subject of active research. For a long time, they were thought to be massless. However, the discovery of neutrino oscillations proved that they do have a small but non-zero mass.\n\n*   **Electron Neutrino (νe):** < 1 eV/c² (or < 1x10⁻⁹ GeV/c²)\n*   **Muon Neutrino (νμ):** < 0.17 MeV/c² (or < 1.7x10⁻⁴ GeV/c²)\n*   **Tau Neutrino (ντ):** < 18.2 MeV/c² (or < 1.82x10⁻² GeV/c²)\n\nExperiments have established upper limits for the masses of the three neutrino types. It is known from cosmological observations that the sum of the three neutrino masses is less than 0.12 eV/c².</information>"
