    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **State the normalization condition:** In quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle in the entire space where it can exist must be equal to 1. This is expressed by the normalization integral:\n    ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n2.  **Determine the integration limits:** The problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, these are the limits of our integration. The integral becomes:\n    ∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n3.  **Define the wave function:** The wave function is given as a complex function:\n    ψ(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\n4.  **Calculate the square of the modulus, |ψ(x)|²:** For any complex number z = Re + i*Im, the square of its modulus is |z|² = Re² + Im².\n    In our case:\n    *   The real part is Re(x) = a / √(1 + x)\n    *   The imaginary part is Im(x) = -0.5\n\n    So, the square of the modulus is:\n    |ψ(x)|² = (a / √(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n5.  **Set up the integral:** Substitute the expression for |ψ(x)|² into the normalization equation:\n    ∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n6.  **Solve the integral:** We can split the integral into two parts:\n    ∫₁³ [a² / (1 + x)] dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    *   **First part:** The integral of a² / (1 + x) is a² * ln(1 + x).\n    *   **Second part:** The integral of 0.25 is 0.25 * x.\n\n    Now, we evaluate the definite integral:\n    [a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x] from 1 to 3 = 1\n\n7.  **Apply the limits of integration:**\n    (a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1) = 1\n    (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1\n\n8.  **Simplify the equation:**\n    a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1\n    a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\n    Using the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c):\n    ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2)\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\n9.  **Solve for \"a\":**\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    a = √(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n10. **Calculate the numerical value:** We will use a python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of a**2\na_squared = 0.5 / math.log(2)\n\n# Calculate the value of a\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(a)\n```\nThe calculation shows that a ≈ 0.8493.\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) 0.35\n    B) 0.6\n    C) 0.85\n    D) 1.1\n\nThe calculated value of 0.8493 is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the value of the normalization constant \"a\" for a given wave function ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i, knowing that the particle is only found in the interval 1 < x < 3.\n\n**1. Normalization Condition**\nThe fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the total probability of finding a particle in all possible locations must be 1. This is expressed by the normalization condition:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nThe integration is performed over the entire space where the particle can exist.\n\n**2. Integration Limits**\nThe problem states that the particle is only found between x = 1 and x = 3. Therefore, these will be the limits of our definite integral.\n\n**3. Calculate the Modulus Squared |ψ(x)|²**\nThe wave function ψ(x) is a complex number. For any complex number z = Re + i*Im, the square of its modulus is |z|² = (Re)² + (Im)².\nIn our case:\n- Real part, Re(ψ) = a / √(1 + x)\n- Imaginary part, Im(ψ) = -0.5\n\nSo, the square of the modulus is:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / √(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**4. Set up and Solve the Integral**\nNow we set up the normalization integral with the determined limits and the expression for |ψ(x)|²:\n∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts for easier calculation:\n∫₁³ [a² / (1 + x)] dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nSolving each part:\n- The integral of a² / (1 + x) is a² * ln|1 + x|.\n- The integral of 0.25 is 0.25 * x.\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x] evaluated from x=1 to x=3 = 1\n\nApply the upper and lower limits:\n(a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1) = 1\n(a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1\n\n**5. Solve for \"a\"**\nSimplify the equation:\na² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c):\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, isolate a²:\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nFinally, solve for a:\na = √(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n**6. Numerical Calculation**\nUsing the output from the code:\na ≈ 0.84932\n\n**7. Conclusion**\nThe calculated value a ≈ 0.8493 is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
