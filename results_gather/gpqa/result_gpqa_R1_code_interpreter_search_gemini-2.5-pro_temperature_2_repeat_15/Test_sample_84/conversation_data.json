    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Temperatures:**\nWe need to calculate the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$. Let's write the expressions for both planets:\n$T_{eq,1} = T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}$\n$T_{eq,2} = T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}$\n\nNow, we form the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels out.\nAfter simplification, the ratio becomes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nSo, to find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n**4. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe radial velocity (RV) method gives us the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K), which is the maximum speed of the star along our line of sight caused by the planet's gravitational pull. For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_*$), K is related to the planet's mass and its semi-major axis by the following formula:\n$K = \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_*}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n(This formula assumes an edge-on orbit, where the inclination $i=90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i)=1$. Since the planets were also detected by the transit method, their orbits must be very close to edge-on, making this a valid assumption).\n\nFrom this relation, we can see that $K$ is proportional to $M_p / \\sqrt{a}$.\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{M_p}{K} \\frac{\\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_*}}$\n$a = \\left( \\frac{M_p}{K} \\right)^2 \\frac{G}{M_*}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes:**\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. Since both planets orbit the same star, the terms G and $M_*$ are constant and will cancel out in the ratio.\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{M_2}{K_2} \\right)^2 \\frac{G}{M_*}}{\\left( \\frac{M_1}{K_1} \\right)^2 \\frac{G}{M_*}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{M_2}{K_2} \\right)^2}{\\left( \\frac{M_1}{K_1} \\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), since $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$, where c and $\\lambda_0$ are constants. Therefore, the ratio of K's is the same as the ratio of $\\Delta\\lambda$'s:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nWe are also given the planet masses: $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$ and $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$. The ratio of the masses is:\n$\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 M_{Earth}}{7 M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow, we substitute these ratios into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nFinally, we substitute the ratio $a_2/a_1$ back into our temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}}$\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we compute the fraction.\n\n```python\n# M2/M1\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n# K1/K2\nk_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Teq1 / Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\n# a2/a1 = (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n# Therefore, Teq1/Teq2 = (M2/M1) * (K1/K2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * k_ratio\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
