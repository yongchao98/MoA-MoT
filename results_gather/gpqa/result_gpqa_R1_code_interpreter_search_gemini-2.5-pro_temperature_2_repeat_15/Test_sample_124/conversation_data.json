    "*   **1. Understanding the System:**\n    The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. We need to find the energy and degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) of the third excited state.\n\n*   **2. Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separation of variables in either Cartesian or spherical coordinates.\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    Here, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values: $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n*   **3. Identifying the Energy States:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n*   **4. Calculating the Degeneracy:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of distinct quantum states (eigenfunctions) that have this same energy. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy $g_n$ for a given quantum number $n$ is calculated by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    We are interested in the third excited state, for which $n=3$.\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n\n*   **5. Alternative Method for Degeneracy (State Counting):**\n    We can also find the degeneracy by counting the number of combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = n$. For the third excited state, $n=3$.\n    The possible non-negative integer triplets $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3, 0, 0). There are 3 permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3).\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2, 1, 0). There are $3! = 6$ permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2).\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1). There is only 1 permutation.\n    The total number of states is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue $E_3$.\n\n*   **6. Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) Incorrect energy formula.\n    B) Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.\n    C) Correct energy and correct degeneracy.\n    D) Incorrect energy formula and incorrect degeneracy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
