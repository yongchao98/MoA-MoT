    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reagents**\n    *   **Reactant:** The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let's draw its structure.\n        *   \"oxybenzene\" indicates a phenoxy group (C₆H₅-O-).\n        *   \"(2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)\" is the group attached to the oxygen. It's a 4-carbon chain (\"but-\") with a double bond between C3 and C4 (\"-3-en-\"), two methyl groups on C2, and attachment at C1.\n        *   The structure is: C₆H₅-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂.\n    *   **Reagent:** Hydrogen bromide (HBr). HBr is a strong acid (source of H⁺) and a source of a good nucleophile (Br⁻).\n\n2.  **Analyze Potential Reaction Pathways**\n    The reactant has several reactive sites: the benzene ring, the ether linkage, and the alkene double bond. HBr will most readily react with the alkene double bond via electrophilic addition.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Electrophilic Addition (Protonation)**\n    *   The H⁺ from HBr acts as an electrophile and adds to the double bond.\n    *   According to Markovnikov's rule, the proton will add to the carbon atom of the double bond that has more hydrogen atoms. In this case, the H⁺ adds to the terminal CH₂ group (C4).\n    *   This addition forms the more stable carbocation, which is a secondary carbocation at C3.\n    *   **Initial Carbocation (Intermediate I):**\n        C₆H₅-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH⁺-CH₃\n\n4.  **Step 2: Competing Pathways from Intermediate I**\n    Once this secondary carbocation is formed, several things can happen. Since two products are observed on the TLC plate, we should look for two plausible reaction pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Carbocation Rearrangement**\n        Carbocations can rearrange to form more stable carbocations. A 1,2-methyl shift can occur, where one of the methyl groups from C2 moves to the adjacent positively charged C3.\n        *   C₆H₅-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH⁺-CH₃   →   C₆H₅-O-CH₂-C⁺(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂\n        *   This rearrangement converts the secondary carbocation (Intermediate I) into a more stable tertiary carbocation (Intermediate II). This rearrangement is very likely to occur.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Direct Reaction of Intermediate I**\n        Before or instead of rearranging, Intermediate I itself can react.\n\n5.  **Step 3: Intramolecular Cyclization (Internal Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)**\n    The carbocation intermediates are powerful electrophiles. The phenoxy group (-O-C₆H₅) is an electron-donating group, which activates the benzene ring towards electrophilic attack, especially at the ortho and para positions. The carbocation part of the molecule can attack its own benzene ring. This is an intramolecular reaction.\n\n    *   **Cyclization from Intermediate II (Tertiary Carbocation):**\n        *   The tertiary carbocation at C2 attacks the ortho position of the benzene ring.\n        *   Let's count the atoms that will form the new ring: O-C1'-C2'-C(ortho)-C(ipso). This forms a 5-membered ring fused to the benzene ring. The resulting heterocyclic system is a **2,3-dihydrobenzofuran**.\n        *   Let's determine the substituents. The original C1' (a -CH₂- group) becomes C2 of the new ring. The original C2' (which now holds the charge) becomes C3. Attached to C3 are a methyl group and an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n        *   **Product 1: 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran**.\n\n    *   **Cyclization from Intermediate I (Secondary Carbocation):**\n        *   The secondary carbocation at C3 attacks the ortho position of the benzene ring.\n        *   Let's count the atoms that will form the new ring: O-C1'-C2'-C3'-C(ortho)-C(ipso). This forms a 6-membered ring fused to the benzene ring. The resulting heterocyclic system is a **chromane**.\n        *   Let's determine the substituents. The original C1' (-CH₂-) becomes C2. The original C2' (-C(CH₃)₂-) becomes C3, so it has two methyl groups. The original C3' (-CH⁺-) becomes C4, and it has a methyl group attached.\n        *   **Product 2: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate other possibilities**\n    *   **Attack by Br⁻:** The Br⁻ ion could attack the carbocations. Attack on Intermediate I would give (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. Attack on Intermediate II would give (2-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. While possible, intramolecular cyclization is often very fast and competitive, especially when forming stable 5- or 6-membered rings. Given the options, the two cyclized products are presented as the outcome.\n    *   **Ether Cleavage:** HBr can cleave ethers. This would produce phenol (C₆H₅OH) and a bromoalkene. This doesn't match the options.\n    *   **Anti-Markovnikov Addition:** This would require peroxides and lead to Br adding on the terminal carbon, which is not suggested by the problem.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    The reaction proceeds through electrophilic addition of H⁺ to the alkene, forming a secondary carbocation. This carbocation can either cyclize directly to form a 6-membered ring (chromane derivative) or rearrange to a more stable tertiary carbocation, which then cyclizes to form a 5-membered ring (dihydrobenzofuran derivative). The formation of two spots on TLC is well explained by the formation of these two different cyclized products.\n\n    *   **Product 1:** 3,3,4-trimethylchromane\n    *   **Product 2:** 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran\n\n    This pair of products exactly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
