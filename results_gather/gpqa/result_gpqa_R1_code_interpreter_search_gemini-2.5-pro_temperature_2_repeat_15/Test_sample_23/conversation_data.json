    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\n    *   Let's determine the empirical formula of Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₙHₘ is given by `(m * M_H) / (n * M_C + m * M_H)`, where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n    *   Using approximate integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the fraction is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   The given percentage 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857). Let's check if the formula for a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ, fits this. The mass fraction of hydrogen in CₙH₂ₙ is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7`.\n    *   This is a perfect match. So, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. This confirms it is a saturated compound, so it cannot be an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   One of the constituents of Y is substance Z (a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic. Z is saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. Let the other component of Y be D. So, hydrogenating the mixture {Z, D} gives only Z. Since Z is already saturated, this implies that hydrogenating D must yield Z.\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to Z (a cycloalkane), and also not decolorize bromine water on its own, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. The general formula for such an arene with a single aromatic ring derived from a Cₙ cycloalkane would be CₙH₂ₙ₋₆ (by loss of 3 H₂ molecules). For instance, benzene (C₆H₆) hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Toluene (C₇H₈) hydrogenates to methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z) and its corresponding aromatic analog (D): Y = {CₙH₂ₙ, CₙH₂ₙ₋₆}.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction `X → Y` is described as a disproportionation. This reaction happens on a platinum catalyst with heating. This is characteristic of hydrogen transfer reactions among unsaturated cyclic compounds.\n    *   The reaction forms an equimolar mixture Y. Since X is also equimolar, the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1A + 1B → 1Z + 1D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z. This means both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton as Z. So, A and B are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the formula CₙHₐ and CₙHᵦ, respectively.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   Let's write the balanced chemical equation for the disproportionation:\n        `CₙHₐ (A) + CₙHᵦ (B) → CₙH₂ₙ (Z) + CₙH₂ₙ₋₆ (D)`\n        (Note: For the case of Toluene D=C₇H₈ and Z=C₇H₁₄, the formula for D is CₙH₂ₙ₋₆ as well, since 2n-6 = 2*7-6=8).\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the number of hydrogen atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal.\n        `a + b = 2n + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6` (This general formula seems complex, let's stick to concrete examples).\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific Compounds (or Carbon Skeleton)**\n    *   Z is described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Both cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) are common solvents and fit the CₙH₂ₙ formula and the H mass fraction.\n    *   **Case 1: The C₆ system.** Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This is the most classic example for this type of reaction.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂.\n        *   D = Benzene, C₆H₆.\n        *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}.\n        *   The reaction is: `A(C₆Hₐ) + B(C₆Hᵦ) → Cyclohexane(C₆H₁₂) + Benzene(C₆H₆)`.\n        *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms: `a + b = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n        *   This scenario is chemically sound. For instance, A and B could be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). `10 + 8 = 18`. Both are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n\n    *   **Case 2: The C₇ system.** Let's assume Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄).\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane, C₇H₁₄.\n        *   D = Toluene, C₇H₈.\n        *   Mixture Y = {Methylcyclohexane, Toluene}.\n        *   The reaction is: `A(C₇Hₐ) + B(C₇Hᵦ) → Methylcyclohexane(C₇H₁₄) + Toluene(C₇H₈)`.\n        *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms: `a + b = 14 + 8 = 22`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   We have two plausible answers based on the carbon skeleton: 18 (for C₆) and 22 (for C₇). Both are listed as options (B and D).\n    *   The reaction described is a classic example of Zelinsky disproportionation chemistry, for which the cyclohexane/benzene system is the primary textbook example. In the absence of further information to distinguish the two cases, it is most probable that the question refers to this fundamental C₆ system.\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B, which is `a + b`.\n    *   Based on the C₆ model, this sum is 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
