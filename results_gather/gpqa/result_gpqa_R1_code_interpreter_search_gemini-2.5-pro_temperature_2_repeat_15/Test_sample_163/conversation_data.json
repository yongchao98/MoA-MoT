    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of `system_1` to the total mass of `system_2` (M1_total / M2_total).\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a spectroscopic binary star system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) of the stars. The formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass is given by:\n\n    M_total = (P / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n    where:\n    *   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n3.  **Use the Information About Eclipses:** The problem states that both systems are eclipsing binaries. This is a crucial piece of information because it tells us that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. For an eclipse to occur, the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90 degrees.\n    *   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ sin(90°) = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Mass Formula:** With `sin³(i) ≈ 1`, the formula for the total mass simplifies to:\n\n    M_total ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G)\n\n    This shows that the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\n    M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** We can now calculate the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2):\n\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\n    Note that the constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` cancels out in the ratio.\n\n6.  **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   **For System 1:**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   K1a = 10 km/s\n        *   K1b = 5 km/s\n        *   Sum of velocities (K1a + K1b) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n    *   **For System 2:**\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   K2a = 15 km/s\n        *   K2b = 10 km/s\n        *   Sum of velocities (K2a + K2b) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    *   M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:** To compare with the given options, we'll convert the fraction to a decimal. This can be done with a simple calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters for each system\n# System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0  # km/s\nK1b = 5.0   # km/s\n\n# System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2a = 15.0  # km/s\nK2b = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocities for each system\nK1_total = K1a + K1b\nK2_total = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the masses M1/M2\n# The formula is (P1/P2) * ((K1_total / K2_total)^3)\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * ((K1_total / K2_total)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation yields 0.432.

    "The total mass M of a binary star system is given by the relation derived from Kepler's third law for spectroscopic binaries:\n\nM_total = m1 + m2 = P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2 * π * G * sin³i)\n\nWhere:\n- P is the orbital period.\n- K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n- G is the gravitational constant.\n- i is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing binaries.
