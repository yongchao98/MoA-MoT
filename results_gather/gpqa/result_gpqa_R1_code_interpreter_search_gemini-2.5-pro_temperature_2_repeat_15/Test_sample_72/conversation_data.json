    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed (v_rel) between them.\nb) The total energy (E) of the system.\n\n**2. Given Information**\n*   Astronaut 1: mass `m1 = 2m`, velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Astronaut 2: mass `m2 = 3m`, velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Both are moving in the same direction (positive x-direction).\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, not the classical one. The formula for the relative velocity `v_rel` of two objects moving in the same direction with velocities `v1` and `v2` (as measured in a single reference frame) is:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2 / c^2))`\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n`v1 = 0.6c`\n`v2 = 0.5c`\n\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.30 * c^2) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c`\n\nTo get a decimal value:\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**4. Calculation of Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts:\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n\n**First, calculate the energy of Astronaut 1 (E1):**\n*   `m1 = 2m`\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n\nCalculate `γ1`:\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n`γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n`γ1 = 1.25`\n\nNow, calculate `E1`:\n`E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2`\n`E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n`E1 = 2.5 * mc^2`\n\n**Next, calculate the energy of Astronaut 2 (E2):**\n*   `m2 = 3m`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nCalculate `γ2`:\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n`γ2 = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2)`\n`γ2 = 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547`\n\nNow, calculate `E2`:\n`E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n`E2 = (2 / sqrt(3)) * (3m) * c^2`\n`E2 = (6 / sqrt(3)) * mc^2`\n`E2 = 2 * sqrt(3) * mc^2 ≈ 3.464 * mc^2`\n\n**Finally, calculate the Total Energy (E_total):**\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total = 2.5mc^2 + 2*sqrt(3)mc^2`\n`E_total = (2.5 + 2*sqrt(3)) * mc^2`\n`E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) * mc^2`\n`E_total ≈ 5.964 * mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96mc^2`.\n\nTo confirm the precision of the calculation, we can use a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 1 # We can set c=1 and m=1 for simplicity in calculation ratios\nm = 1\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# Calculate relative velocity\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c**2)\nv_rel_in_c = v_rel / c\nprint(f\"Relative velocity (v_rel) = {v_rel_in_c:.2f}c\")\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1**2 / c**2))\n\n# Calculate energy for astronaut 1\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * c**2\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2**2 / c**2))\n\n# Calculate energy for astronaut 2\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * c**2\n\n# Calculate total energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\nprint(f\"Total Energy (E) = {E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n> Relative velocity (v_rel) = 0.14c\n> Total Energy (E) = 5.96mc^2\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.96mc^2`\n\nThese results match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate two quantities: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ as measured from a common reference frame, their relative velocity $v_{rel}$ is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ moving at velocity $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$).\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n*   Energy $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}}mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3}mc^2 \\approx 3.464mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3})mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464)mc^2 \\approx 5.964mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96mc². This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
