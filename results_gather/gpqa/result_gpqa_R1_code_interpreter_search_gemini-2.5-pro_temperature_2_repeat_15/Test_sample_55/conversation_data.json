    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process and States:**\n    The problem asks for a specific decay route and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (also known as the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state). The process is specified as happening via \"two dipole transitions\". This means it's a two-step process, also known as a cascade decay.\n    *   Initial State ($|i\\rangle$): $|3,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Final State ($|f\\rangle$): $|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Intermediate State ($|k\\rangle$): Let's denote this as $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:**\n    For an electric dipole transition to occur, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer value, but for decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    *   **Step 1:** Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   $l=0 \\rightarrow l'$: According to $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   $n=3 \\rightarrow n'$: Since energy must decrease, $n'<3$. The most probable decay is to the next available energy level, so we consider $n'=2$. Thus, the intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state).\n        *   $m=0 \\rightarrow m'$: According to $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate magnetic quantum number can be $m' = 0, +1, -1$.\n    *   So, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Step 2:** Transition from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $l'=1 \\rightarrow l_f=0$: This gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n        *   $m'=m' \\rightarrow m_f=0$: This gives $\\Delta m = -m'$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, $\\Delta m$ can be $1, 0, -1$, which are all allowed.\n        *   $n'=2 \\rightarrow n_f=1$: Energy decreases, so this decay is allowed.\n\n    *   Therefore, there are three valid two-step transition routes:\n        1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    *   Probability(Route via $m'$) = BR($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$) $\\times$ BR($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$).\n\n    *   **Second Step:** The only dipole-allowed decay from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. (Decay to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l=0$). Thus, the branching ratio for this step is 1 for all three routes.\n        BR($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) = 1.\n\n    *   **First Step:** We need the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states. The branching ratio is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition to the total transition rate.\n        BR($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$) = $\\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total}(|3,0,0\\rangle)}$.\n\n    *   The total decay rate in this two-step dipole channel is the sum of the rates to the three intermediate states:\n        $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) + \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) + \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n\n    *   The transition rate $\\Gamma(i \\rightarrow f)$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$. We need to compare the rates $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$ for $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n\n    *   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom must decay with equal probability to each of the degenerate final states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Any experiment measuring the population of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states after the decay from an ensemble of atoms initially in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state would find them to be equally populated.\n\n    *   **Formal Calculation (using the Wigner-Eckart Theorem):** The transition rate is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\vec{d}_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d}_q$ are the spherical tensor components of the dipole operator and $q=\\Delta m = m'$. The Wigner-Eckart theorem states that this matrix element is the product of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and a reduced matrix element that is independent of the magnetic quantum numbers.\n        $\\langle 2,1,m' | d_{m'} | 3,0,0 \\rangle \\propto \\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$.\n        The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle j_1,0; j_2,m_2 | J,m_2 \\rangle$ with $j_1=0$ is always equal to 1.\n        Therefore, the matrix elements have the same magnitude for all three values of $m'$, and consequently, the transition rates are equal:\n        $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n\n    *   Since the three rates are equal, the branching ratio to each of these states is $1/3$.\n        BR($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$) = $\\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Final Probability and Conclusion:**\n    The overall probability for any of the three specific routes is:\n    Probability(Route via $m'$) = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n    Now, let's examine the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct path and probability)\n    C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Garbled, but incorrect probability)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that matches our derivation is B. The probability of the cascade $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is indeed $1/3$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
