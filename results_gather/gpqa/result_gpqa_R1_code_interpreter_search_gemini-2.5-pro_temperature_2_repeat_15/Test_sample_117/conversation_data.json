    "*   **Analysis of the Reactants:**\n    1.  **4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol:** The name indicates a five-membered ring (cyclopent) with a double bond (`-en-`) and a hydroxyl group (`-ol`).\n        *   The suffix `-1-enol` means the hydroxyl group is on carbon #1, and the double bond starts at carbon #1 (i.e., it's between C1 and C2).\n        *   `4,4-dimethyl` means there are two methyl groups on carbon #4.\n        *   This molecule has a hydroxyl group directly attached to a carbon-carbon double bond, which defines it as an **enol**. Enols are the less stable tautomers of ketones or aldehydes.\n\n    2.  **Bromine (Br₂):** This is a halogen molecule, which acts as an electrophile in reactions with electron-rich species like alkenes or enols.\n\n*   **Identifying the Reaction Type:**\n    The reaction is between an enol and bromine. This is a classic example of the **alpha-halogenation of a ketone**. The reaction proceeds via the enol tautomer, which is conveniently provided as the starting material in this question. The enol's carbon-carbon double bond is electron-rich and acts as a nucleophile.\n\n*   **Step-by-Step Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Tautomer Relationship:** 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol is the enol form of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n         \n        *Keto form (left) and Enol form (right)*\n\n    2.  **Electrophilic Attack:** The π-electrons of the C1=C2 double bond in the enol attack one of the bromine atoms in the Br₂ molecule. The Br₂ molecule is the electrophile. The attack occurs at the C2 position (the alpha-carbon).\n\n    3.  **Intermediate Formation:** The bromine atom attaches to C2. This breaks the C=C double bond and places a positive charge on C1. This resulting carbocation is not a simple carbocation; it is resonance-stabilized by the lone pair of electrons on the adjacent oxygen atom. This stable intermediate is an oxonium ion, which can be viewed as a protonated α-bromo-ketone.\n         \n        *Enol attacks Br₂ to form a resonance-stabilized intermediate*\n\n    4.  **Deprotonation:** A base in the solution (which can be the bromide ion, Br⁻, formed in the previous step, or a solvent molecule) removes the proton from the positively charged oxygen atom.\n\n    5.  **Final Product:** The removal of the proton neutralizes the oxygen atom and forms a carbonyl group (C=O). The final product has the carbonyl group at the C1 position and the bromine atom at the adjacent C2 position. The rest of the molecule's structure, including the two methyl groups at C4, remains unchanged.\n         \n        *Deprotonation to form the final α-bromoketone*\n\n*   **Naming the Product:**\n    The final product is a cyclopentanone derivative.\n    *   The carbonyl group defines C1.\n    *   The bromine atom is on C2.\n    *   The two methyl groups are on C4.\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name is **2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Incorrect. Bromination occurs at the alpha-carbon (C2), not the remote C4.\n    *   B) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: Incorrect. This is a di-bromo alcohol. The reaction of an enol with a halogen yields an alpha-halo ketone, not a di-halo alcohol.\n    *   C) **2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone:** Correct. This matches the product derived from the established mechanism for the bromination of an enol.\n    *   D) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: Incorrect. For the same reasons as option B.\n\nTherefore, the major outcome of the reaction is the formation of the α-bromoketone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
