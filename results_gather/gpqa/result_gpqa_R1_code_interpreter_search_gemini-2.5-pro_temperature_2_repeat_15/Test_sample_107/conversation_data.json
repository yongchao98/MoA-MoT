    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate and compare the order of magnitude of two distinct energy quantities: the paramagnetic coupling energy $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ due to an external magnetic field, and the energy of a specific electronic transition $\\Delta E$ in the Hydrogen atom.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$\n\nThe interaction energy of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is described by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for this interaction, often called the paramagnetic coupling term, is:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere $\\vec{\\mu}$ is the total magnetic moment of the atom, which is the sum of the orbital magnetic moment ($\\vec{\\mu}_L$) and the spin magnetic moment ($\\vec{\\mu}_S$). This can be written as:\n$H = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}(\\vec{L} + g_s\\vec{S}) \\cdot \\vec{B}$\nHere, $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, $\\vec{L}$ is the orbital angular momentum, $\\vec{S}$ is the spin angular momentum, and $g_s \\approx 2$ is the electron spin g-factor.\n\nThe magnetic field is given as $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$ (parallel to the z-axis), with $B = 1$ T. The energy shift is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar}\\left\\langle L_z + g_s S_z \\right\\rangle = \\mu_B B (m_l + g_s m_s)$\nwhere $m_l$ and $m_s$ are the orbital and spin magnetic quantum numbers, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that $m$ (which we take as $m_l$) is small. For a typical small, non-zero value like $m_l = 1$ and a spin value of $m_s = \\pm 1/2$, the energy is on the order of $\\mu_B B$. We can calculate this value to determine its order of magnitude.\n\nThe Bohr magneton $\\mu_B$ has a value of approximately $9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$.\nFor a magnetic field $B=1$ T:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx \\mu_B B = (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$\n\nThe energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during an atomic transition is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = h f = \\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe given wavelength is $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\nUsing the values of the constants:\n$h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n$c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nWe can calculate the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.088 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\n### 3. Comparison of Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n-   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n-   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 4.088 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nTo compare them, we can find their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.088 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nSince the ratio is extremely small ($ \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-5}$), the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\nIn terms of LaTeX, the comparison is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation:\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Given values\nB = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nlambda_wavelength = 0.4861e-6  # Wavelength in meters\n\n# Physical constants\nmu_B = const.physical_constants['Bohr magneton'][0]  # Bohr magneton in J/T\nh = const.h  # Planck constant in J.s\nc = const.c  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the order of magnitude for the paramagnetic coupling term\n# For small quantum numbers, this is on the order of mu_B * B\nE_H = mu_B * B\n\n# Calculate the transition energy\ndelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_wavelength\n\n# Calculate the ratio to compare the magnitudes\nratio = E_H / delta_E\n\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> is approximately {E_H:.3e} J.\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E is {delta_E:.3e} J.\")\nprint(f\"The ratio <H> / Delta E is {ratio:.3e}.\")\nprint(\"\\nSince the ratio is much less than 1, we can conclude that <H> << Delta E.\")\n\n```\nExecution output:\n```\nParamagnetic coupling energy <H> is approximately 9.274e-24 J.\nTransition energy Delta E is 4.088e-19 J.\nThe ratio <H> / Delta E is 2.269e-05.\n\nSince the ratio is much less than 1, we can conclude that <H> << Delta E.\n```\nThe numerical result confirms our reasoning.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the magnitude of two energy values:\n1.  The paramagnetic coupling energy, which is the energy of interaction between the atom's magnetic moment and the external magnetic field. This is the Zeeman effect energy shift.\n2.  The energy of an atomic transition, given by its wavelength.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of an atom with an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is given by:\n$H_{Zeeman} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}$ is the magnetic dipole moment of the atom. The energy is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian. The magnetic moment is the sum of the orbital and spin magnetic moments: $\\vec{\\mu} = \\vec{\\mu}_L + \\vec{\\mu}_S = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}(\\vec{L} + g_s\\vec{S})$, where $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, $\\vec{L}$ is the orbital angular momentum operator, $\\vec{S}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, and $g_s \\approx 2$ is the electron spin g-factor.\n\nGiven that the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$, the interaction energy is:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\langle L_z + g_s S_z \\rangle B = \\mu_B B (m_l + g_s m_s)$\n\nThe problem states that the orbital magnetic quantum number $m_l$ is small. Let's consider a typical small non-zero value, like $m_l=1$, and the electron spin is $m_s=\\pm\\frac{1}{2}$. The energy is of the order of magnitude of $\\mu_B B$.\n\nWe are given:\n- Magnetic field strength, $B = 1 \\text{ T}$\n- The Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$\n\nThe order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx \\mu_B B = (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\nIn LaTeX format:\n$$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx \\mu_B B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J} $$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$\n\nThe energy of a photon associated with an atomic transition is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given:\n- Wavelength, $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n- Planck's constant, $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n- The speed of light, $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nNow, we calculate the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.088 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nIn LaTeX format:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.088 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} $$\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n- Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n- Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 4.088 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nTo compare them, we look at their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24}}{4.088 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nSince this ratio is extremely small, the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy. This is a general feature: Zeeman splittings are typically much smaller than the fine structure splittings, which are in turn much smaller than the energy differences between principal energy levels. The given transition corresponds to an energy difference between principal levels in the hydrogen atom (specifically, the Balmer beta line, $n=4 \\to n=2$).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ is much, much less than $\\Delta E$.\n\nIn LaTeX format, the relationship is:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
