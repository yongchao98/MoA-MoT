    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN (a source of the nucleophile CN⁻).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction. It is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This addition breaks the pi bond of the C=O group, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable product with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. A common way to achieve this is through an acidic workup. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion, representing an aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄) is the standard reagent for this protonation step. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   Considering the options, NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) forms a different type of adduct with ketones and is incorrect for this synthesis. So, we can eliminate options B and D. We are left with options A and C.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The key functional group to consider is the nitrile group (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The nitrile group has been converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This transformation is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is typically heated with a strong aqueous mineral acid, such as HCl or H₂SO₄. The nitrile is first protonated, attacked by water, and eventually converted to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (e.g., NaOH), which initially forms a carboxylate salt. An acidic workup is then needed to protonate the carboxylate to get the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of reagent B:** Reagent B, along with water (H₂O), is the catalyst for this hydrolysis reaction to directly form the carboxylic acid.\n        *   Comparing the choices for B in the remaining options A and C:\n            *   **B = HCl (from option A):** Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a standard and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n            *   **B = CH₃COOH (from option C):** Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction under harsh conditions (very long reaction times and high temperatures), it is not a typical or efficient reagent for nitrile hydrolysis. Strong acids are preferred.\n    *   Therefore, HCl is the most suitable reagent for B.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
