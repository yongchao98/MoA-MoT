    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, molecules can be achiral even with stereocenters if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (these are called meso compounds).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms directly involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, and the first C of the ethyl group) all lie in the same plane.\n    *   A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex molecule with a rigid, bicyclic structure.\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS)` and `(E)`.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the configuration at two stereocenters. While a molecule with multiple stereocenters can be meso (achiral), this is unlikely for such a complex and asymmetric structure. Meso compounds typically have a more symmetric substitution pattern (e.g., compound 3).\n    *   The parent structure, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, can be achiral (meso). However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` (a `>C=CHCl` group), attached to the framework, breaks this potential symmetry.\n    *   In general, when an IUPAC name provides specific `R/S` designations for a complex molecule, it refers to a single enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule where one half is the mirror image of the other half. There is an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   This is a classic example of a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   In the `(2R,3R)` isomer, the molecule no longer has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   It is a chiral molecule, and it has an enantiomer, the `(2S,3S)` isomer.\n    *   Since it is a chiral molecule, it will be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   Let's check C1 for chirality. The four groups attached to C1 are: -OH, -H, the ring segment `-CH2-CH=`, and the other ring segment `-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-`.\n    *   Tracing the paths around the ring from C1, they are different: one path encounters the double bond at C3, the other encounters it at C4 (after passing through C5 and C6). Thus, the two ring connections are different groups.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name `(R)` specifies one of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   The molecule exists in two rapidly interconverting chair conformations (one with all -OH groups axial, the other with all -OH groups equatorial).\n    *   Both of these individual chair conformations are chiral (they possess a C3 axis of symmetry but no mirror plane).\n    *   However, the molecule can pass through an achiral boat conformation during the ring-flipping process. This boat conformation has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Because the two enantiomeric chair conformers can easily interconvert via an achiral intermediate conformation, the compound cannot be resolved into separate enantiomers and is considered achiral overall (functionally meso). It will not exhibit optical activity.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Based on IUPAC conventions, the structure is cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-[cyclopentyl ring]`.\n    *   Let's check for any stereocenters. The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH` group is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters in the chain or the unsubstituted cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters.\n    *   Furthermore, it's possible to find a conformation of this molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane would pass through the carbonyl group and bisect the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Summary**:\n*   Active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   Active: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   Active: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
