    "SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators. These operators are suppressed by some high-energy scale, Î›, representing new physics beyond the direct reach of experiments. The construction of SMEFT is based on a set of core principles. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. Quantum Field Theories, including the Standard Model and its effective extensions like SMEFT, are built to be consistent with special relativity. Therefore, all terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, i.e., all operators, must be constructed to be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). This is a foundational requirement.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** This symmetry group extends Lorentz symmetry by also including spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a bedrock principle of any standard relativistic Quantum Field Theory. The SMEFT Lagrangian as a whole is invariant under Poincare transformations.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most famously through the CKM matrix in the weak interactions. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it naturally incorporates the SM's CP violation. Furthermore, the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT provide new, independent sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry in SMEFT; many operators are explicitly constructed to violate it.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** This is the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory, stating that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT invariant. SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, and thus, by the CPT theorem, it must respect CPT symmetry. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be CPT-even.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Lorentz Symmetry (1) **must** be respected.\n*   Poincare Symmetry (2) **must** be respected.\n*   CP Symmetry (3) is **not** required to be respected.\n*   CPT Symmetry (4) **must** be respected.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\nThis corresponds to items 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
