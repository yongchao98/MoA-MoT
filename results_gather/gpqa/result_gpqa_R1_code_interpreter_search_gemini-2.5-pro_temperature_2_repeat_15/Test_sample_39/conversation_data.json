    "The user is asking to interpret a common phrase used by synthetic organic chemists. The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a colloquialism that describes a situation during the purification and analysis of a chemical mixture.\n\n1.  **Analyze the context:** The conversation is between two synthetic organic chemists. A major part of their work involves synthesizing new molecules and then purifying them from unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and reagents.\n2.  **Consider the common purification techniques:** The most common purification technique in a synthetic organic chemistry lab is chromatography, especially thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for quick analysis and column chromatography for large-scale separation. Other methods include distillation, recrystallization, and extraction.\n3.  **Evaluate the phrase \"on top of each other\":** This phrase strongly suggests a spatial relationship, which is most visually apparent in chromatography.\n    *   In **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC)**, a mixture is spotted at the bottom of a plate coated with a stationary phase (like silica gel). A solvent (mobile phase) then moves up the plate. Compounds in the mixture travel up the plate at different rates depending on their properties. The final result is a series of spots at different heights. If two compounds do not separate well, their spots will overlap, literally appearing \"on top of each other\" or very close together.\n    *   This concept extends to **column chromatography**, where compounds travel down a column packed with the stationary phase. If two compounds travel at the same rate, they will be collected in the same fractions, a situation often described as the compounds \"coming out on top of each other.\"\n4.  **Relate purification techniques to chemical properties:**\n    *   **Chromatography (TLC and column)** primarily separates compounds based on their **polarity**. Compounds with similar polarities will interact similarly with the stationary and mobile phases and will therefore be very difficult to separate. This perfectly matches the scenario where compounds are \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   **Distillation** separates compounds based on their **boiling points**. If two compounds have similar boiling points, they will be difficult to separate by distillation. While a valid separation problem, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is not the most common way to describe this. Chemists are more likely to say \"they co-distill\" or \"their boiling points are too close.\"\n    *   **Optical rotation** is a physical property used to characterize chiral molecules. It is not a separation technique itself. Compounds with similar optical rotations don't necessarily present a separation problem.\n    *   **Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions** are the fundamental forces responsible for properties like polarity and boiling point. However, the chemist's statement refers to the macroscopic outcome of a failed separation experiment, not the underlying intermolecular forces themselves. The *consequence* of having similar intermolecular interaction profiles (i.e., similar polarity) is the failure to separate.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is most directly and commonly used to describe the result of a failed chromatographic separation (like on a TLC plate). This failure is caused by the compounds having very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
