    "This question asks us to identify which of the described exoplanets has the highest density. Let's analyze each option based on the principles of planetary science.\n\n1.  **Analyze Option a): An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    This planet is essentially a twin of Earth. The density of Earth is a standard reference value in planetary science.\n    *   Mass = 1 Earth-mass (M⊕)\n    *   Radius = 1 Earth-radius (R⊕)\n    *   Density (ρ) = Mass / Volume. Volume is proportional to Radius³.\n    *   The average density of Earth (ρ⊕) is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   So, for this planet, ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n2.  **Analyze Option b): A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n    This option explicitly gives us the density of the planet.\n    *   Mass = 2 M⊕\n    *   Density ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   This is almost identical to Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option c): A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    This is a key concept in planetary structure. \"Same composition\" means it's made of the same materials (like iron and silicate rocks) in the same proportions as Earth. However, the density will not be the same.\n    *   Mass = 5 M⊕.\n    *   Because this planet is much more massive than Earth, its own gravity will be significantly stronger.\n    *   This stronger gravity will compress the materials in its interior to a much greater degree than in Earth.\n    *   Greater compression means the same amount of material is packed into a smaller volume.\n    *   Density is Mass / Volume. Since the mass has increased five-fold, and the volume will have increased by a factor less than five (due to compression), the resulting density must be higher than Earth's density.\n    *   Using the empirical mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, R ∝ M^~0.27, we can estimate the density. A more massive rocky planet is always denser than a less massive one of the same composition. Therefore, ρ_c > ρ⊕ ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n4.  **Analyze Option d): A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    This is the reverse scenario of option c).\n    *   Mass = 0.5 M⊕.\n    *   Again, the planet has the same composition as Earth.\n    *   However, with less mass, the force of gravity is weaker.\n    *   The materials will be less compressed than they are inside Earth.\n    *   This means the planet will be \"fluffier\" for its mass compared to Earth.\n    *   Its density will be lower than Earth's density. Therefore, ρ_d < ρ⊕ ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_b ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n*   ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nBy comparing the densities, it is clear that the planet in option c) will have the highest density due to the significant gravitational compression from its large mass.\n\n<<<C>>>"
