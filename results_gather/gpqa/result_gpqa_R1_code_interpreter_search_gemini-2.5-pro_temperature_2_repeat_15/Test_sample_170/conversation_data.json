    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the question.**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of substituted benzene rings. We need to arrange the starting materials in order of increasing yield of the para-bromo product. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the mole fraction of the yield, so we can work with percentage yields of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents.**\nWe need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect on the benzene ring for electrophilic substitution.\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Methyl): Activating, o,p-directing.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethyl): Activating, o,p-directing.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chloro): Deactivating, but o,p-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the position meta to themselves. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-directing.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl carboxylate): Deactivating, m-directing.\n    *   6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-directing.\n\n**Step 3: Order the groups with the lowest para-yield.**\nThe meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6) will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer. The yield of the para-product for these groups is inversely related to their deactivating strength (the stronger the deactivator, the more it directs to the meta position, and the less para-product is formed).\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength for these groups is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5.\n*   In terms of substance numbers, the beginning of our sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the groups with the highest para-yield.**\nThe ortho, para-directing groups (1, 3, 5) will have much higher yields of the para-isomer than the meta-directors. We need to order them based on their specific para/ortho product ratios. This ratio is influenced by both steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   Let's consult typical experimental percentage yields for the para-isomer in bromination:\n    *   **1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3):** The methyl group offers some steric hindrance to the ortho positions. The yield of para-bromotoluene is approximately **67%**.\n    *   **5) Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, leading to greater steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This strongly favors para substitution. The yield of para-bromoethylbenzene is very high, approximately **94%**.\n    *   **3) Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl):** The chloro group is ortho, para-directing due to resonance, but its strong inductive effect deactivates the ring, especially at the ortho position. This also favors para substitution. The yield of para-bromochlorobenzene is approximately **87%**.\n\n*   Arranging these in order of increasing para-yield gives:\n    Toluene (67%) < Chlorobenzene (87%) < Ethylbenzene (94%).\n*   In terms of substance numbers, the order for this group is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the sequences.**\nSince all o,p-directors give a much higher para yield than any m-director, we can combine the two ordered groups.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: 1 < 3 < 5\n*   The complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the given options.**\nLet's check the options against our derived correct sequence.\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nNone of the options exactly match our derived correct sequence (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5). However, let's analyze Option D more closely.\nOption D: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n*   The order of meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) is correct.\n*   It correctly places the o,p-directors after the m-directors.\n*   It correctly identifies toluene (1) as having the lowest para yield among the o,p-directors.\n*   It makes a single error: it swaps the order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). It claims 5 < 3, which corresponds to 94% < 87%, which is false.\n\nGiven that all other options have more significant and multiple errors, Option D is the \"best fit\" and most likely the intended answer, assuming a mistake was made in constructing the option's final order.\n\nFinal Order based on reasoning:\n4 (-NO2, ~1%) < 6 (-COOH, ~2%) < 2 (-COOC2H5, ~3%) < 1 (-CH3, 67%) < 3 (-Cl, 87%) < 5 (-C2H5, 94%).\n\nClosest option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
