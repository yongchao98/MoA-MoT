    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators:**\n    The problem provides the Cartesian components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    This is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The problem asks for the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be represented in spherical coordinates with the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. Let $\\theta$ be the angle this vector makes with the z-axis.\n    The components of the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ are:\n    *   $n_x = \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi = \\sin\\theta \\cos(0) = \\sin\\theta$\n    *   $n_y = \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = \\sin\\theta \\sin(0) = 0$\n    *   $n_z = \\cos\\theta$\n    So, the direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{P}$.\n    $P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{n}$ and the operators:\n    $P_n = (\\sin\\theta) \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) + (0) \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) + (\\cos\\theta) \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right]$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right]$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector, let's call it $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components:**\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's rearrange the first equation to find the relationship between `a` and `b`:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Now, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    *   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    *   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The unnormalized eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. For simplicity, let $a=1$, so $|\\psi\\rangle_{un} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    The normalization condition requires that the inner product $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. For a general eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix}$, the norm squared is $|c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2 = 1$.\n    Our eigenvector can be written as $|\\psi\\rangle = N \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$, where we have multiplied the components $(a,b)$ by a common factor to clear the denominator, and N is the normalization constant.\n    The norm squared is:\n    $N^2 (|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2) = 1$\n    $N^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    $N^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |N|=1$\n\n    Choosing the simplest phase factor, $N=1$, we get the normalized eigenvector:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
