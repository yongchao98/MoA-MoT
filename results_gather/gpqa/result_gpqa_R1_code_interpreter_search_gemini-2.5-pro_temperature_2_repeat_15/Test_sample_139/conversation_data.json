    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the clue about Gas W.**\n    The problem states that the reaction of substance X with liquid Y releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine some simple gas molecules:\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Protons ≠ Neutrons)\n    *   HD (Hydrogen Deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Protons ≠ Neutrons)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium): 2 protons (1 per atom), 2 neutrons (1 per atom). (Protons = Neutrons). This is a strong candidate.\n    *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons (7 per atom), 14 neutrons (7 per atom). (Protons = Neutrons). This is also a possibility.\n\n2.  **Analyze the clues about Substance X.**\n    *   It \"incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\" The possibility of D₂ gas strongly suggests this heavier isotope is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   Its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards common reagents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs, sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄) and lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄), are widely used to introduce deuterium into molecules.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" Keto acids have both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ (and its analog LiAlD₄) reduce both groups. For example, `R-C(=O)-COOH + [Reducing Agent] -> R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`. The product is a diol, which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This is consistent with X being a powerful deuterated reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n3.  **Identify the reaction between X and Y.**\n    Let's hypothesize that **X is LiAlD₄** (Lithium aluminum deuteride). Hydrides react violently with water.\n    If liquid Y is normal water (H₂O), the reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O -> LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4HD`. The gas produced is HD, which does not have an equal number of protons and neutrons. This contradicts clue #1.\n    Let's consider that liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O). The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   The gas released (W) is D₂. As established in step 1, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the clue perfectly.\n    *   The reaction is violent, as expected.\n\n4.  **Identify Precipitate G and Substance B.**\n    The products of the reaction `LiAlD₄ + D₂O` are LiOD, Al(OD)₃, and D₂.\n    *   LiOD is soluble, but aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, **G = Al(OD)₃**, would also be a precipitate.\n    *   When G is heated, hydroxides (and deuteroxides) decompose. The reaction is `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. The substance released is **B = D₂O** (heavy water).\n    *   The final clue is that \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\" The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This value is indeed very close to 277 K.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of Identification.**\n    All clues consistently point to the following identities:\n    *   Substance X = **LiAlD₄**\n    *   Liquid Y = **D₂O**\n    *   Gas W = **D₂**\n    *   Precipitate G = **Al(OD)₃**\n    *   Substance B = **D₂O**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Value.**\n    The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1), which is present as its isotope Deuterium (D).\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen** (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum** (Z=13).\n\n    The calculation must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements within the molecule, using their isotopic masses.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        Cumulative mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The most stable and abundant isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n        Cumulative mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n    The final step is to sum these two cumulative masses:\n    Total cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the elements and their quantities in Substance X (LiAlD4).\n# Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as 4 Deuterium atoms, D).\n# Heaviest element: Aluminum (present as 1 Aluminum atom, Al).\n\n# Step 2: Define the mass numbers for the relevant isotopes.\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D or 2H) is 2.\n# Mass number of the common isotope of Aluminum (27Al) is 27.\n\nnum_D = 4\nmass_D = 2\n\nnum_Al = 1\nmass_Al = 27\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the cumulative mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen).\ncumulative_mass_lightest = num_D * mass_D\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the cumulative mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum).\ncumulative_mass_heaviest = num_Al * mass_Al\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final sum.\ntotal_cumulative_mass = cumulative_mass_lightest + cumulative_mass_heaviest\n\nprint(total_cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
