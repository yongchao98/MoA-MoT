    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5 relative to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   Acetyl (-COCH3): meta-director, deactivating.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2): meta-director, strongly deactivating.\n    *   Bromo (-Br): ortho, para-director, deactivating.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern with a mix of meta- and ortho,para-directors suggests that a simple sequential substitution might not be effective and could lead to mixtures of isomers. Often, complex substitution patterns are achieved using a \"directing group\" that is later removed. The presence of reagents for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by reduction (H3PO2) in the options strongly hints at a strategy involving the removal of an amino (-NH2) group. This is a classic synthetic tool known as deamination.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Reaction Options\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n#### **Option B**\ni) `Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene`\nii) `Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline`\niii) `Aniline --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Benzenediazonium chloride`\niv) `Benzenediazonium chloride --(H3PO2)--> Benzene`\nThis sequence of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is a pointless circular synthesis. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n#### **Option D**\ni) `Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene`\nii) `Bromobenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene` (para is the major product).\niii) `1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?` This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. Such reactions generally fail or give extremely low yields. This makes the entire sequence not a \"high-yield synthesis\". Therefore, Option D is highly unlikely.\n\n#### **Option C**\ni) `Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene`\nii) `Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline`\niii) `Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?` This reaction is problematic. Aniline reacts with the Lewis acid AlCl3 at the nitrogen atom, deactivating the ring. Acetyl chloride would primarily acylate the nitrogen to form acetanilide, for which a Lewis acid is not typically used. Assuming it's intended to form acetanilide:\n`... --> Acetanilide`\niv) `Acetanilide --(Br2/FeBr3)-->` Bromination of the activated acetanilide ring, likely giving p-bromoacetanilide.\nv) `p-Bromoacetanilide --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` Nitration occurs ortho to the activating -NHCOCH3 group, yielding 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide.\nvi) `4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide --(NaNO2/HCl)--> No reaction`. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2), not an amide (-NHCOCH3). The amide would need to be hydrolyzed first, a step that is missing. Therefore, Option C is chemically flawed as written.\n\n#### **Option A**\nThis option appears long and complex, but let's analyze it carefully, assuming it might involve the formation of a key intermediate that rearranges the substitution pattern correctly.\n\ni) `Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone`\nThe -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n\nii) `Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone`\nThe acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. This is correct.\n\niii) `3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitration Product`\nWe have two deactivating groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1) and -Br (at C3). -COCH3 is a meta-director (directs to C5). -Br is an o,p-director (directs to C2, C4, C6). When directing effects conflict, the least deactivating group often controls the position. Here, -Br is less deactivating than -COCH3. Thus, substitution will be directed by the bromine to the ortho and para positions relative to it. The para position (C6) is sterically favored. This nitration would yield 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone (which can also be named 5-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone). Let's assume this is our product.\n\niv) `5-Bromo-2-nitroacetophenone --(Fe/HCl)--> 5-Bromo-2-aminoacetophenone`\nThe nitro group is reduced to a primary amine.\n\nv) `5-Bromo-2-aminoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitration Product`\nNow we nitrate this molecule. Let's analyze the directing effects on the available positions (C3, C4, C6):\n*   -NH2 group (at C2): A very strong activating o,p-director. It directs to its ortho position C3 and its para position C5 (which is blocked by -Br). Thus, it strongly directs the new group to C3.\n*   -COCH3 group (at C1): A meta-director. It directs to C3 and C5 (blocked). So it also directs to C3.\n*   -Br group (at C5): An o,p-director. It directs to C4 and C6.\nThe powerful activating -NH2 group and the -COCH3 group reinforce each other to direct the incoming nitro group to position C3. This reaction should be highly regioselective.\nThe product is **2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone**.\n\nvi) `2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium Salt`\nThe primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n\nvii) `Diazonium Salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`\nThe diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination). The remaining substituents are the acetyl group (at C1), the nitro group (at C3), and the bromo group (at C5). This is exactly the target molecule.\n\nThis entire sequence is chemically sound and all steps lead logically to the final product with good control over regiochemistry, especially in the crucial nitration (step v) and final deamination steps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A presents a viable, albeit complex, high-yield synthetic route to the target compound. The other options contain chemically flawed steps or lead to incorrect products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
