    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l=1$. Let's denote them as $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$. The problem states that the system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    This notation represents an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator, $\\hat{L}^2 = (\\hat{L}_1 + \\hat{L}_2)^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$. The eigenvalues are:\n    *   $\\hat{L}^2 |\\psi\\rangle = l(l+1)\\hbar^2 |\\psi\\rangle = 2(2+1)\\hbar^2 |\\psi\\rangle = 6\\hbar^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n    *   $\\hat{L}_z |\\psi\\rangle = m\\hbar |\\psi\\rangle = -1\\hbar |\\psi\\rangle$\n    So, the system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement:** A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ and $\\hat{L}_{2z}$. The basis states for this measurement are the uncoupled states, denoted as $|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle$, or more simply $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are fixed at 1.\n\n3.  **Identify the desired final state:** The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ corresponds to the electron 1 being in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $\\hat{L}_{2z}$ corresponds to the electron 2 being in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    Therefore, the final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|\\phi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1=1, m_1=-1, l_2=1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Relate the initial and final states using the properties of angular momentum:** We can express the coupled state (initial state) as a linear combination of the uncoupled states (the basis for the measurement). This is done using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = |l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n    A fundamental property (a selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n5.  **Apply the selection rule to the problem:**\n    *   For the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the selection rule is satisfied: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ and $m = -1$, we have $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the probability:** The probability of measuring the system in the state $|\\phi_{final}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ onto the final state $|\\phi_{final}\\rangle$. This projection is the coefficient of $|\\phi_{final}\\rangle$ in the expansion of $|\\psi\\rangle$, which is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |\\langle \\phi_{final} | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1 \\rangle|^2$\n    Because the selection rule $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n**Alternative Reasoning (Eigenvalue Argument):**\n1. The initial state $|\\psi\\rangle = |l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-angular momentum operator $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n2. The final state corresponding to the measurement outcome is $|\\phi\\rangle = |m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$. This state is also an eigenstate of $\\hat{L}_z$. Let's find its eigenvalue:\n   $\\hat{L}_z |\\phi\\rangle = (\\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}) |m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle = (m_1\\hbar + m_2\\hbar) |\\phi\\rangle = (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar) |\\phi\\rangle = -2\\hbar |\\phi\\rangle$.\n3. So, the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ and the final state $|\\phi\\rangle$ are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator, $\\hat{L}_z$, but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$).\n4. A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Therefore, the inner product $\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle = 0$.\n5. The probability of measuring the outcome $|\\phi\\rangle$ is $P = |\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning lead to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>"
