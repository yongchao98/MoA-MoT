    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data from the gas treatment.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong drying agent (desiccant) and absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H2O).\n    *   Molar mass of H2O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.200 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO2, SO2, NO2. The fact that the weight of the tube did not change means that no gases were absorbed. This is a crucial clue, indicating the absence of acidic gases in the decomposition products.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper reacts with oxidizing agents, particularly those containing oxygen. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. This mass increase is solely due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.050 mol.\n    *   This oxygen came from an oxygen-containing gas that passed through Tube №2 unreacted. Possible neutral or near-neutral gases include O2, N2O, or NO.\n\n4.  **Final Gas (C):** The remaining gas that did not react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.100 mol.\n    *   This gas must be inert under the conditions described. Given that nitrogen-containing salts were heated, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N2).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe total mass of the mixture (7.20 g) must be equal to the sum of the masses of its constituent elements. These elements are found in the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the H2O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 * (moles of H2O) = 2 * 0.200 mol = 0.400 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.400 mol * 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H2O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H2O) + (moles of O that reacted with Cu) = 0.200 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.250 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.250 mol * 16.00 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The rest of the mass must be nitrogen. Let's confirm this by analyzing the nitrogen-containing gases. The gas that reacted with Cu could be N2O (reacts as `N2O + Cu -> N2 + CuO`) or NO (`2NO + 2Cu -> N2 + 2CuO`), both of which produce N2.\n    *   Let's assume the reacting gas was N2O. It contained 0.050 mol of O, so we had 0.050 mol of N2O. This reaction would produce 0.050 mol of N2. The final gas C was 0.100 mol of N2, so there must have been an initial 0.100 - 0.050 = 0.050 mol of N2 from the decomposition as well.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = (2 * moles N2O) + (2 * moles initial N2) = (2 * 0.050) + (2 * 0.050) = 0.200 mol.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.200 mol * 14.007 g/mol ≈ 2.80 g.\n\n*   **Total Mass Check:** Mass H + Mass O + Mass N = 0.40 g + 4.00 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that the salts consist only of H, O, and N.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Salts A and B.**\n\nWe have the mole ratio of the elements in the total mixture:\n`N : H : O = 0.200 : 0.400 : 0.250`\nTo find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest number (0.200):\n`N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25`\nMultiplying by 4 to get whole numbers:\n`N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5`\nThe overall empirical formula of the combined salts (A+B) is **N4H8O5**.\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means `Formula(A) + Formula(B) = N4H8O5`.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. Common ions are the ammonium cation (NH4+) and oxyanions of nitrogen like nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-).\nThe presence of 8 H atoms strongly suggests two ammonium cations: `2 * NH4+`, which gives `N2H8`.\nAfter accounting for the cations (`N2H8`), the remaining atoms for the anions are:\n`N(4-2)H(8-8)O5` -> `N2O5`.\nSo, the two anions must sum to `N2O5` and have a total charge of -2 to balance the two `NH4+` ions.\nThe perfect fit for this is the nitrate anion (NO3-) and the nitrite anion (NO2-):\nAnion 1: NO3-\nAnion 2: NO2-\nCombined: `NO3- + NO2- = [N2O5]^2-`. The charge matches.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3)**\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2)**\n\nWe can verify this with the expected decomposition reactions at 200°C:\n`NH4NO3(s) -> N2O(g) + 2H2O(g)`\n`NH4NO2(s) -> N2(g) + 2H2O(g)`\nThis set of reactions perfectly produces the gases (N2O, N2, H2O) and in the quantities calculated in the previous steps.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe final step is to count the atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH4NO3):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9**\n\n*   **Salt B (NH4NO2):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Final calculation check\n# Atoms in Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3): 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9\n# Atoms in Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2): 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8\ntotal_atoms = 9 + 8\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Gas Treatment Results**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases from heating the salts is passed through three tubes. We will analyze the mass change in each tube to identify the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O produced = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, it means no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means an oxygen-containing gas that is not water and not acidic passed through and reacted with the copper. The mass increase is solely due to oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The common, non-acidic, nitrogen-based gas that can provide oxygen to hot copper is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂.\n    *   According to the stoichiometry of this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O contains 1 mole of O atoms. Therefore, 0.05 mol of O atoms must have come from **0.05 mol of N₂O**. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n*   **Final Remaining Gas (C):** After all the reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas did not react with any of the tubes. Given the context of heating nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct the Original Gas Mixture**\n\nLet's summarize the products of the initial thermal decomposition:\n1.  Water (H₂O) = 0.20 mol.\n2.  Dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n3.  Nitrogen (N₂). The final amount of N₂ was 0.10 mol. This total includes the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction in Tube №3 (0.05 mol) plus any N₂ that was part of the original gas mixture.\n    *   Original N₂ = Total final N₂ - N₂ from N₂O reaction\n    *   Original N₂ = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\nSo, heating the salt mixture produced **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that A and B are an equimolar mixture. This means we have an equal number of moles (`n`) of each salt. Let's look for known decomposition reactions of common ammonium salts that produce these gases.\n\n*   The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) produces nitrogen gas and water:\n    `NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)`\n*   The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) produces dinitrogen monoxide and water:\n    `NH₄NO₃ (s) → N₂O (g) + 2H₂O (g)`\n\nIf we assume the two salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃, and we have `n` moles of each, the total products would be:\n*   `n` moles of N₂ (from NH₄NO₂)\n*   `n` moles of N₂O (from NH₄NO₃)\n*   `2n + 2n = 4n` moles of H₂O (from both reactions)\n\nLet's compare this to our experimental results:\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol → `n = 0.05 mol`\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol → `n = 0.05 mol`\n*   Moles of H₂O = `4n` = 4 * 0.05 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\nOur experimental results (0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.20 mol H₂O) perfectly match the products from an equimolar mixture where `n = 0.05 mol`.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ equals the given starting mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g.\nThis is an excellent match for the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe two salts are identified as ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). We need to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of all atoms in salts A and B = 9 + 8 = 17**\n\n```python\n# Atoms in Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) are N=2, H=4, O=3. Total = 2 + 4 + 3\natoms_in_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Atoms in Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) are N=2, H=4, O=2. Total = 2 + 4 + 2\natoms_in_B = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total number of atoms in both salts\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
