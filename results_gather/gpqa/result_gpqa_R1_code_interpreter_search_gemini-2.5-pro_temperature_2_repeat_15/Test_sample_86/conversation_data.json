    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Molecular Formula and Features from the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C₆) with two substituents attached. A di-substituted benzene ring has the formula C₆H₄.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n**2. Assembling the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group (C=O). Let's deduce the structure of this C₂-carbonyl substituent.\n    *   **Possibility 1: Acetyl group, -C(=O)CH₃.** This group has two carbons and a carbonyl. The resulting molecule is a haloacetophenone: X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 1 (carbonyl C) + 1 (methyl C) = 8. This fits all the criteria.\n    *   **Possibility 2: A -CH₂CHO group.** This group also has two carbons and a carbonyl. The resulting molecule is a (halophenyl)acetaldehyde: X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 1 (CH₂ C) + 1 (CHO C) = 8. This also fits all the criteria.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Provided 1H NMR Options**\n\nNow, we need to determine which of the possible structures matches one of the given NMR spectra. A key feature to look for in the spectra is the pattern in the aromatic region. For a para-disubstituted ring (which is highly symmetrical), we expect to see a distinct pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H. For ortho or meta substitution, the pattern would be more complex.\n\n*   **Option B and D:** These can be immediately eliminated because they do not show signals in the typical aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm) that would account for the 4 protons on a di-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Option A: 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum corresponds to the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n    *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: A sharp singlet very far downfield is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n    *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: A signal in this region for 2 protons fits a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group (a benzylic, α-carbonyl position). The singlet multiplicity means it is not observably coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n    *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern indicates a para (1,4) substitution on the benzene ring.\n*   **Option C: 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum corresponds to the haloacetophenone structure (X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3 protons around 2.1-2.6 ppm is the classic signature of a methyl ketone (-COCH₃).\n    *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern again indicates para (1,4) substitution.\n\n**4. Differentiating Between Option A and C using Chemical Shift Theory**\n\nBoth options A and C seem plausible as they describe molecules that fit the initial criteria and exhibit para-substitution patterns. The decision must be made by looking closer at the chemical shifts. The aromatic chemical shifts in both options are identical (7.8 and 7.6 ppm). We need to determine for which structure these shifts are more realistic.\n\n*   The electronic effect of the substituent determines the chemical shift of the aromatic protons. Both -COCH₃ and -CH₂CHO are electron-withdrawing groups, which deshield the ring protons and shift them downfield.\n*   However, the acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a much stronger electron-withdrawing group than the -CH₂CHO group because its carbonyl is directly conjugated with the aromatic ring (a powerful -R resonance effect).\n*   The -CH₂CHO group's carbonyl is insulated from the ring by a CH₂ group, so it can only exert a weaker, inductive (-I) effect.\n*   Therefore, the aromatic protons of **p-haloacetophenone** (structure for C) should be significantly more downfield (higher ppm) than those of **p-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde** (structure for A).\n\nLet's verify this by checking typical literature values.\n*   **For p-haloacetophenone** (e.g., p-bromoacetophenone), the aromatic signals are indeed found around **7.6-7.9 ppm**. This matches the data in option C.\n*   **For p-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde** (e.g., p-bromophenylacetaldehyde), the aromatic signals are found at much higher fields (lower ppm), typically around **7.1-7.5 ppm**.\n\nThe aromatic shifts given in Option A (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are inconsistent with the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure it represents. These shifts are far too downfield. In contrast, the data in Option C is entirely consistent with a p-haloacetophenone structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a p-haloacetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum would show two doublets in the aromatic region for the 4 aromatic protons and a singlet for the 3 methyl protons. Option C accurately describes this.\n\n<<<C>>>"
