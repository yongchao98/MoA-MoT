    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n\n**Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n**Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n**Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. A base generates an enolate from the ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor).\n\n**Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n1.  Identify the α-carbons of the ketone, which are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). These are C2 and C6.\n2.  The carbon at position C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3). It has no α-hydrogens and cannot be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n3.  The carbon at position C6 has one hydrogen atom. It can be deprotonated by the base t-BuOK.\n4.  Therefore, the enolate is formed regiospecifically at C6.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Michael Addition**\n1.  The enolate anion at C6 is the nucleophile.\n2.  Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the Michael acceptor. The β-carbon (the CH₂ group) is electrophilic.\n3.  The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n4.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexane ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n5.  After the initial addition, an enolate is formed from the ethyl acrylate part, which is then protonated (likely by abstracting a proton from the solvent or during workup) to give the final neutral product.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Naming the Product (Product A)**\n1.  The final product has an ester as the principal functional group. Therefore, the parent name is **ethyl propanoate**.\n2.  The cyclohexane ring is a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The connection is at carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n3.  Now, we need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is numbered as C1. The numbering proceeds around the ring to give the principal functional group on the ring (the ketone) the lowest possible number.\n    *   **Attachment point (old C6) becomes New C1.** This carbon has a methyl group.\n    *   **The keto group (old C1) becomes New C2.**\n    *   **The quaternary carbon (old C2) becomes New C3.** This carbon has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n4.  Combining the substituent names based on the new numbering:\n    *   A methyl group at C1 (1-methyl)\n    *   An oxo group at C2 (2-oxo)\n    *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C3 (3-ethyl, 3-methyl)\n5.  The full name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n6.  Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches options C and D.\n\n*(Note on Stereochemistry: The prompt mentions considering steric hindrance. In a Michael addition, the most thermodynamically stable product is usually formed. This means the large, newly added ethyl propanoate group will preferentially occupy an equatorial position on the cyclohexane chair conformer to minimize steric strain.)*\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n**Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile).\n**Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water (H₂O).\n**Reaction Type:** This is another Michael addition.\n\n**Step 1: Nucleophile Formation**\n1.  1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂) has acidic protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group).\n2.  The base KOH deprotonates this α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`). This is the nucleophile.\n\n**Step 2: Michael Addition**\n1.  The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n2.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n3.  The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Naming the Product (Product B)**\n1.  The resulting molecule is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n2.  The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n3.  The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n4.  Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    `C6H₃-C5H₂-C4H(NO₂)-C3H(CH₃)-C2H₂-C1N`\n5.  The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n6.  The full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for B in options B and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option D contains the correct names for both products A and B.\n\n<<<D>>>"
