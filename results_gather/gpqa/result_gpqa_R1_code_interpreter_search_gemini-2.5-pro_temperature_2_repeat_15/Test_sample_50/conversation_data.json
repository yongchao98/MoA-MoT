    "This problem requires the use of the method of image charges to find the potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n*   We have a point charge `q`.\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V = 0`).\n*   The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`).\n\n**2. The Method of Image Charges**\nThe electric field and potential outside the sphere are the same as if the sphere were replaced by a strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere's original volume. The goal is to place an image charge `q'` at a certain location `b` from the center such that the potential on the surface `r=R` becomes zero.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are given by:\n*   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Position of the image charge (from the center): `b = R^2 / d`\n\nSo, our original system of (charge `q` + grounded sphere) is equivalent, for all points outside the sphere, to a simpler system of two point charges:\n1.  The original charge `q` at distance `d` from the origin.\n2.  The image charge `q' = -q(R/d)` at distance `b = R^2/d` from the origin, on the same line.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it induces a charge on the sphere. The force between `q` and the induced charge changes as `q` moves.\n\nA standard result in electrostatics is that the potential energy `U` of a charge distribution is `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`. For a system of a point charge `q` and a conductor, this simplifies to `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`, where `V_other` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the potential at `q` due to the induced charge.**\n    The potential created by the induced charge on the sphere at the location of `q` is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n    The distance between the original charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    The potential `V_image` at location `d` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    where `k = 1 / (4πε₀)`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`.**\n    `q' = -qR/d`\n    `b = R^2/d`\n    `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    So, the potential is:\n    `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    `V_image = - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the total potential energy `U`.**\n    Using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`, where `V_other = V_image`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Compare with the Options**\nLet's look at the given choices:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur calculated result `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
