    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The term symbol is given by `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   **Spin (S):** `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** `L` is denoted by 'S' => `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J` is given as '0' => `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a system is determined by its orbital angular momentum: `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin (T):** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a system of two identical fermions (nucleons) requires the total wavefunction `Ψ = ψ(space)ψ(spin)ψ(isospin)` to be antisymmetric.\n    *   The symmetry of the spatial part `ψ(space)` is `(-1)^L`. For `L_i=0`, it's symmetric (+1).\n    *   The symmetry of the spin part `ψ(spin)` is `(-1)^(S+1)`. For `S_i=0`, it's `(-1)^(0+1) = -1` (antisymmetric).\n    *   For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, `(+1) * (-1) * ψ(isospin)` must be -1. This means `ψ(isospin)` must be symmetric, which corresponds to an isospin `T_i = 1`.\n    *   (Alternatively, the problem provides a rule `T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`. For the initial state `S_i=0, L_i=0`, this would imply `T_i = 0 + 0 + 1 (mod 2) = 1`, which confirms our finding.)\n\nSo, the initial state is `(S_i, L_i, J_i, T_i, P_i) = (0, 0, 0, 1, +1)`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe reaction is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must check each proposed final state against three rules:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    The problem states `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    For the final state, we are given `T(NN, final) = 0`.\n    Plugging this in gives: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. This is equivalent to stating that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\n    The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN, final) * P(X, intrinsic) * P(X, orbital)`.\n    *   `P(NN, final) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   `P(X, intrinsic) = -1` (given).\n    *   `P(X, orbital) = (-1)^{L_X}`, where `L_X` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X.\n    The conservation equation is: `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{L_X}`.\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + L_X}`.\n    `(-1)^{L_f + L_X} = -1`.\n    This means the exponent `L_f + L_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Angular Momentum Conservation**\n    The total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final`.\n    *   `J_initial = J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_final` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`J_X`). The simplest case, and the one implied by the notation, is to consider the vector sum of `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of X, `L_X`. For the total final angular momentum to be zero, these two vectors must be able to cancel each other out. This requires that they have equal magnitude, i.e., `J_f = L_X`.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the proposed transitions against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Emitted particle `p` (p-wave): `L_X=1`.\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd).  **OK.**\n    2.  **Parity:** `L_f + L_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 1`, `L_X = 1`. `J_f = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Emitted particle `f` (f-wave): `L_X=3`.\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n    2.  **Parity:** `L_f + L_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 3`, `L_X = 3`. `J_f = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Emitted particle `s` (s-wave): `L_X=0`.\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **NOT PERMITTED.** This violates the Pauli statistics constraint for the final `T=0` NN state.\n    2.  **Parity:** `L_f + L_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 0`, `L_X = 0`. `J_f = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: Not permitted due to the violation of Rule 1.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Emitted particle `p` (p-wave): `L_X=1`.\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n    2.  **Parity:** `L_f + L_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 1`, `L_X = 1`. `J_f = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\nThe only transition that violates one of the fundamental rules is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
