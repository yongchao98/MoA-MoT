    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The '(S)' designation indicates it is a single, pure enantiomer.\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n    CH3-CH2-C-CH2-CH(S)-CH3\n                    |\n                   OCH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the planar carbonyl group can occur from either the front face or the back face, both possible configurations at C3 will be formed.\n*   **Products:** The reaction starts with a molecule having the (S) configuration at C5 and generates a new stereocenter at C3. This results in the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one stereocenter (C3) while having the same configuration at another (C5). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not enantiomers are called **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n      O     O\n      \\\\   //\n    CH3-C-CH2-C-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is also a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl (-OH) groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    ```\n      OH    OH\n      |     |\n    CH3-CH-CH2-CH-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Products:** Since two chiral centers are formed, we must consider all possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4 (through the central CH2 group).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are mirror images of each other and are not superimposable. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, these enantiomers will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) configuration is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). This is because of the internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R))\n    The enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) are diastereomers of the meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separation**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomeric compounds:\n*   **From Rxn I:** Two diastereomers.\n*   **From Rxn II:** A pair of enantiomers and one meso compound (a total of three stereoisomers).\n\nNow let's consider the two HPLC methods:\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (different connectivity, e.g., products of Rxn I vs. Rxn II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated; they will elute as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated from each other. This gives **2 peaks**.\n2.  From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute, giving **1 peak**.\n3.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, so it will be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n4.  The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) are completely different molecules (constitutional isomers), ensuring they elute at different times.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for meso from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate all different stereoisomers (constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers), assuming ideal resolution.\n\nLet's count the peaks by counting every unique molecule in the mixture:\n*   From Reaction I:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (**Peak 1**)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (**Peak 2**)\n*   From Reaction II:\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 3**)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 4**, separated from its enantiomer)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 5**)\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
