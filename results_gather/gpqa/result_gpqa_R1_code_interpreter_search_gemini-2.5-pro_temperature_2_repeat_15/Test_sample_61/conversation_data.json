    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. Let's break down this name to understand its structure.\n    *   **Parent structure:** `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This consists of a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to it.\n    *   **Substituent:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This substituent is located at position 1 of the cyclohexane ring, which is the same carbon atom that holds the aldehyde group.\n    *   The substituent `cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl` is a `-CH(OH)-(cyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Putting it together: The structure has a cyclohexane ring. One carbon of this ring is bonded to both a `-CHO` group and a `-CH(OH)C6H11` group.\n\n    This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is characteristic of an **aldol addition product**. Let's deduce the reactants of this aldol reaction. The C-C bond formed in an aldol addition is between the α-carbon of one molecule (the nucleophile/enolate) and the carbonyl carbon of another molecule (the electrophile).\n    *   The α-carbon is the one bearing the `-CHO` group.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon that was attacked is now the `CH(OH)` carbon.\n    *   By mentally reversing the reaction, we break the bond between `C(CHO)` and `CH(OH)`. This reveals that both fragments originate from **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CHO)**.\n    *   Therefore, the target molecule is the product of the **self-aldol addition** of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    `2 * C6H11CHO --(base)--> C6H11-CH(OH)-C(α)(CHO)-(on a C6H10 ring)`\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Routes:**\n    The goal is to start with **ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH)** and synthesize the aldol product described above. This requires first synthesizing cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and then performing the aldol reaction.\n\n    Let's analyze each option:\n\n    *   **Option A: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n        *   Step 1: `NaNH2` is a strong base that deprotonates the terminal alkyne. However, `methanol (CH3OH)` is a protic solvent that reacts with `NaNH2` (NaNH2 + CH3OH → NH3 + CH3ONa) or would protonate the acetylide anion if it were formed. This step is chemically unsound or would simply regenerate the starting alkyne. Thus, option A is incorrect from the start.\n\n    *   **Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n        *   This sequence is jumbled and chemically nonsensical.\n        *   Step 1 would form `C6H11-C≡C-CH3`.\n        *   Step 2 (`H2/Pd`) would hydrogenate the alkyne completely to an alkane (`C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3`). Alkanes are unreactive to the subsequent reagents.\n        *   If the order were different (e.g., alkyne hydration with `H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O`), it would form a ketone (`C6H11-C(=O)-CH2CH3`), not the required aldehyde. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n        *   Step 1 would form `C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3`.\n        *   Step 2 is a dissolving metal reduction, which would form the (E)-alkene `(E)-C6H11-CH=CH-CH2CH3`.\n        *   Step 3 is ozonolysis with an **oxidative workup (`H2O`)**. This cleaves the double bond to form carboxylic acids (`C6H11-COOH`) and ketones, not aldehydes. The target synthesis requires an aldehyde intermediate. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option B: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n        *   **Step 1:** `ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2` → `cyclohexylacetylide anion`. Then, `+ CH3Cl` (SN2 reaction) → **1-cyclohexylpropyne (C6H11-C≡C-CH3)**. This is a correct and standard alkyne alkylation.\n        *   **Step 2:** `1-cyclohexylpropyne + H2/Pd-CaCO3` (Lindlar's catalyst) → **(Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (cis-alkene)**. This is a correct syn-hydrogenation of an alkyne to a cis-alkene.\n        *   **Step 3:** `(Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene + O3/(CH3)2S` (reductive ozonolysis) → **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CHO)** and **acetaldehyde (CH3CHO)**. This is the correct outcome for cleaving the double bond. This step successfully produces the required aldehyde precursor.\n        *   **Step 4:** The mixture of aldehydes is treated with **`Ba(OH)2`**, a base. The base will catalyze aldol reactions. While a mixture of four different aldol products is possible (from self- and crossed-condensations), one of these products is the desired target molecule, the self-aldol product of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    Sequence B is the only chemically plausible route presented. Each step correctly performs a standard organic transformation that logically leads toward the target. While the final step produces a mixture, it is the only option that can form the necessary intermediate (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and then subject it to conditions that form the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
