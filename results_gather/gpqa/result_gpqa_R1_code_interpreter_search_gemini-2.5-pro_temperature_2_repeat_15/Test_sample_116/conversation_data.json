    "An organic moiety shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in atropisomers). Let's analyze each of the given compounds.\n\n### 1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound, which consists of two benzene rings linked by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The key to chirality in biphenyls is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. This restricted rotation occurs when there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule:\n    *   The substituents at positions 2 and 2' are methylcarboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   The substituents at positions 6 and 6' are nitro groups (-NO₂).\n    *   Both of these groups are bulky enough to sterically hinder free rotation around the central C-C bond. This forces the two phenyl rings into a stable, non-planar conformation.\n    *   This locked, non-planar structure lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, a form of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n### 2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n*   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** We look for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group):\n    *   It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, carbon-2 is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism and exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n### 3. benzophenone\n\n*   **Structure:** This compound has the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. Specifically, it has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and reflects one phenyl group onto the other. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### 4. dimethyl fumarate\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-ene-1,4-dioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. A planar molecule always has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements (a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion) means the molecule is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
