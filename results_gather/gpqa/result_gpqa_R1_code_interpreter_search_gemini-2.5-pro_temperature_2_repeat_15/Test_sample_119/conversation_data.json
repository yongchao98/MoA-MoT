    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the setup:** The problem asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range (`dN/d(plx)`) and the parallax (`plx`), given that stars are uniformly distributed in space.\n\n2.  **Define Uniform Distribution:** A uniform spatial distribution means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere in space. The number density is the number of stars per unit volume.\n    *   `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:** We can calculate the total number of stars, `N`, within a certain distance, `d`, from an observer. Assuming the observer is at the center, the volume of space up to distance `d` is the volume of a sphere with radius `d`.\n    *   Volume `V(d) = (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    *   The total number of stars up to distance `d` is `N(d) = ρ * V(d) = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:** We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range* of a variable (in this case, parallax). Let's first find the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dd`). This corresponds to the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `d` with a very small thickness `dd`. We can find this by differentiating `N(d)` with respect to `d`.\n    *   `dN/dd = d/dd [ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3]`\n    *   `dN/dd = ρ * (4/3) * π * (3 * d^2) = 4 * π * ρ * d^2`\n    *   This tells us that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `d` is proportional to `d^2`. `dN/dd ∝ d^2`.\n\n5.  **Introduce Parallax:** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The standard formula is:\n    *   `plx = 1/d` (where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    *   This means we can also write distance in terms of parallax: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n6.  **Change the Variable from Distance to Parallax:** We want to find `dN/d(plx)`, the number of stars per unit range of parallax. We have `dN/dd`. We can use the chain rule from calculus to change the variable of differentiation:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the components:**\n    *   From step 4, we have `dN/dd ∝ d^2`. We can substitute `d = 1/plx` into this expression:\n        `dN/dd ∝ (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx^2`\n    *   Now we need to find the derivative `dd/d(plx)`:\n        `d = 1/plx = plx^(-1)`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx^(-2) = -1/plx^2`\n    *   When we talk about the number of stars in a range, we are concerned with the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (it just indicates that `d` decreases as `plx` increases). So we take the absolute value: `|dd/d(plx)| = 1/plx^2`.\n\n8.  **Combine the results:** Now we substitute these components back into the chain rule equation from step 6.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ (dN/dd) * |dd/d(plx)|`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2)`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFor a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
