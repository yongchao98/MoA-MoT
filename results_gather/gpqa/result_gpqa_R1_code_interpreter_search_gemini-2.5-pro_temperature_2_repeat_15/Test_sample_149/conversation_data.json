    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, C8H9NO, from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the NMR data.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (n=2 protons).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (n=1). This coupling pattern (-CH2-CHO) is consistent with the aldehyde proton signal. Thus, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment (an ethanal group).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadrupolar coupling with nitrogen and/or chemical exchange.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO) as substituents. Putting them together gives the structure 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: The benzene ring is C6H4. The substituents are -NH2 and -CH2CHO. Total formula = C6H4 + NH2 + C2H3O = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given molecular formula.\n\n    The starting material is:\n    ```\n        NH2\n         |\n        / \\\n       || ||\n       \\\\ //\n        |\n      CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged. The product is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    ```\n      Cl- +N2\n         |\n        / \\\n       || ||\n       \\\\ //\n        |\n      CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Diazonium salts are unstable and, upon warming in water, undergo hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from the water. This reaction converts the diazonium salt into a phenol. The product is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    ```\n        OH\n         |\n        / \\\n       || ||\n       \\\\ //\n        |\n      CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The starting material for this step is an aldehyde with acidic protons on the alpha-carbon (the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for a self-aldol condensation reaction.\n\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    ```\n                             OH\n                             |\n    HO-Ph-CH2-CHO   +   HO-Ph-CH2-CHO    --->    HO-Ph-CH2-CH - CH - Ph-OH\n          (Ph = C6H4)                                      |    |\n                                                         OH   CHO\n    ```\n    This intermediate is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The proton on the α-carbon (C2) is acidic and is removed by the base, and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated. This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings.\n    ```\n       OH                           CHO\n       |                             |\n    HO-Ph-CH2-CH - CH - Ph-OH     --->    HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C-Ph-OH   +   H2O\n                 |    |\n               OH   CHO\n    ```\n    The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product expected under heat.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This has an incorrect molecular formula and structure.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**: This name correctly describes the structure of the final product derived from the aldol condensation.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: This has incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and the wrong position for the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
