    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    For a conservative force like Hook's law, the total energy of the system is constant. In the relativistic case, we need to use the relativistic form of kinetic energy. The total energy $E$ can be expressed as the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy $K$ and the potential energy $U$.\n    $E = K + U$\n    This total energy $E$ remains constant throughout the motion.\n\n2.  **Define the kinetic and potential energies.**\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The potential energy for a spring obeying Hook's law ($F = -kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where we set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n3.  **Analyze the energy at two extreme points of the oscillation.**\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude ($x=A$):** The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v=0$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   The kinetic energy is $K_A = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum, $U_A = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is $E = K_A + U_A = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position ($x=0$):** The mass has its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   Let the Lorentz factor at this speed be $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum, $K_0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        *   The potential energy is zero, $U_0 = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is $E = K_0 + U_0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy must be the same at both points. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for the total energy:\n    $E_A = E_0$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$ using the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    We have the definition of the Lorentz factor:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    Square both sides:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    Rearrange to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}\\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n7.  **Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ into the equation for $v_{max}$.**\n    Now, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ from step 5 into the equation from step 6:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
