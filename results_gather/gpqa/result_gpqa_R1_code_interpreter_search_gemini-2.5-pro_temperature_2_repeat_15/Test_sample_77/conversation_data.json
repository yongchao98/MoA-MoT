    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a position `\\vec{s}(t')` at time `t'`. We are observing the electromagnetic field at a position `\\vec{r}` at a later time `t`. Due to the finite speed of light `c`, the field we observe at `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, `tr`, known as the **retarded time**.\n\n2.  **Define the key vectors and retarded time:**\n    *   **Charge position at retarded time:** `\\vec{s}(tr)`\n    *   **Observer position:** `\\vec{r}`\n    *   **Vector from source to observer:** `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |\\vec{d}|`.\n    *   **Charge velocity at retarded time:** `\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}` evaluated at `t' = tr`.\n\n    The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time difference `t - tr` is exactly the time it takes for light to travel the distance `d`:\n    `t - tr = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c}`.\n    This is an implicit equation for `tr`.\n\n3.  **Start with the retarded potential integrals:**\n    The general solutions for the potentials from time-varying charge density `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')` and current density `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')` are the retarded potentials:\n    `V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n    where `tr = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n4.  **Adapt for a point charge:**\n    For a single point charge `q` following a trajectory `\\vec{s}(t')`, the charge and current densities are:\n    `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n    `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n    where `\\delta^3` is the Dirac delta function.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the integrals:**\n    Substituting the delta functions into the integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time `tr` also depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`. The standard derivation, which accounts for the \"stretching\" or \"compressing\" of the apparent volume of the charge due to its motion, yields the following result:\n\n    `\\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} \\right]_{tr}`\n\n    The subscript `tr` means all quantities (`d`, `\\vec{d}`, `\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    Let's simplify the denominator:\n    `d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}`\n\n6.  **Find the Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} \\right]_{tr} = \\left[ \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right]_{tr}`\n\n7.  **Find the Vector Potential (\\vec{A}):**\n    Similarly, for the vector potential, we integrate `\\vec{J}`. The velocity `\\vec{v}(tr)` can be treated as a constant with respect to the spatial integration.\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q\\vec{v}(tr)\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\vec{v}(tr) \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n    The integral part is the same as for the scalar potential divided by `\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}`.\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V`\n    Using the expression for `V` we just found:\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left[ \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right]_{tr} = \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right]_{tr}`\n    Using the relation `\\mu_0 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)`, we can write this as:\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\left[ \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right]_{tr}`\n\n8.  **Compare with options:**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n    `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\n    These expressions match option (C) exactly.\n\n    *   Option A has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is incorrect. This would correspond to advanced potentials (information traveling backward in time), not the physical retarded potentials.\n    *   Option B and D use the static potential `q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r)` which is only valid for a stationary charge and ignores the retardation and motion effects on the potential's magnitude. While the relation `\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V` is correct, the formula for V itself is wrong in option D.\n\nTherefore, option (C) provides the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>"
