    "*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically one found in a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   Conclusion from FTIR: The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This supports the FTIR data indicating an alkene functional group.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic indicator for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12.01 for C + 16.00 for O + 16.00 for O + 1.01 for H ≈ 45).\n\n*   **Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Formulas:**\n    *   The combined spectral data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid (it contains both -COOH and C=C groups).\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms, which immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    *   Now we must choose between B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). We can use the degree of unsaturation (DBE) to distinguish them. The formula for DBE is: DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   The presence of a C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) contributes 1 to the DBE.\n    *   The presence of a C=C double bond (from the alkene) contributes another 1 to the DBE.\n    *   Therefore, the total DBE of the molecule must be at least 2.\n\n*   **DBE Calculation for the remaining options:**\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (B):** DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This matches our required DBE.\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (D):** DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which does not have a C=C bond and would not show vinyl-hydrogen peaks in the 1H NMR.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that is consistent with all the provided data (unsaturated carboxylic acid) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
