This is basic, which is correct for the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, as the resulting solution contains the conjugate base which undergoes hydrolysis to produce OH⁻.\n    *   The calculated values (4.26 and 8.52) match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants to find the pH of a solution at two different points during a titration.\n\n**1. Initial Setup and Dilution**\n\n*   First, we need to calculate the concentration of acetic acid (CH₃COOH, a weak acid) after it has been diluted.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid:\n    *   Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles = M₁ × V₁ = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 moles of CH₃COOH.\n*   Dilution: 20.00 cm³ of water is added.\n    *   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid solution) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   New concentration of acetic acid (M₂) for titration:\n    *   M₂ = Moles / V₂ = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Titration Calculation - pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH (a strong base) to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The reaction is:\nCH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻Na⁺ + H₂O\n\n*   At this point, the solution is a buffer, containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH reacted = 25% of initial moles = 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = Moles of CH₃COOH reacted = 0.00025 mol.\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 75% of initial moles = 0.75 × 0.001 mol = 0.00075 mol.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )\n*   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   Since the acid and its conjugate base are in the same volume, the ratio of their concentrations is the same as the ratio of their moles.\n    pH = 4.73 + log ( 0.00025 / 0.00075 )\n    pH = 4.73 + log (1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253\n\n**3. Titration Calculation - pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only the salt, sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n*   **Step A: Find the total volume at the equivalence point.**\n    *   First, find the volume of NaOH required. Moles of acid = Moles of base.\n    *   0.001 mol = V_NaOH × 0.1 M\n    *   V_NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n\n*   **Step B: Find the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻).**\n    *   Moles of acetate = Initial moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate.**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis:\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume 'x' is negligible compared to 0.02.\n        *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n        *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\n**Summary of Calculated Values:**\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.25 - 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nThese values match option D.
