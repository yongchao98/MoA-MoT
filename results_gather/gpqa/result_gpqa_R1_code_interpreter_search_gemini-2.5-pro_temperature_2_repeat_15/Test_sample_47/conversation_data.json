    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a ketone) and Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction takes place at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). In cyclohexanone, both α-carbons are equivalent. The reaction substitutes one hydrogen atom on an α-carbon with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactants:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-haloketone with a proton on the other α-carbon undergoes a ring contraction when treated with a strong base.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (⁻OH) removes the most acidic α-proton, which is on the carbon *not* bearing the bromine atom. This forms an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate anion attacks the carbon with the bromine in an intramolecular Sₙ2 fashion, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻) and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, cleaving the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the more substituted carbon of the cyclopropane ring, which relieves the ring strain. This leads to the formation of a five-membered ring (cyclopentane) with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  An acidic workup (which is implied before the next step) protonates the carboxylate to give a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), and Pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is used to catalyze the reaction and neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a reduction reaction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH₄, it is selective for reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We need to determine the number of unique proton environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde C-H bond, the carbonyl C=O bond, the C1-C(aldehyde) bond, and the C1-H bond. This plane bisects the cyclopentane ring through C1 and the midpoint of the C3-C4 bond.\n\nLet's identify the different sets of hydrogens:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the hydrogen on the carbon atom of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group. It is also unique. (1 signal)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes carbon C2 equivalent to carbon C5. Each of these carbons has two protons (a CH₂ group). Because C1 is a stereocenter, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, one is *trans*). They are not chemically equivalent and will produce two different signals. Due to symmetry, the two protons on C5 are equivalent to their respective counterparts on C2. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 together give rise to **two** distinct signals. (2 signals)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes carbon C3 equivalent to carbon C4. Each has a CH₂ group. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic relative to the substituent at C1. They are chemically non-equivalent. The four hydrogens on C3 and C4 also give rise to **two** distinct signals. (2 signals)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1 signal\n*   C1 H: 1 signal\n*   C2/C5 Protons: 2 signals\n*   C3/C4 Protons: 2 signals\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
