    "An oscillating charge distribution is the source of electromagnetic radiation. To analyze this, we use the multipole expansion. In the far-field (radiation zone), the power radiated can be expressed as a series of terms corresponding to electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and so on.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Dominant Radiation Term:**\n    The power of the multipole radiation terms depends on the frequency (ω) or wavelength (λ = 2πc/ω) as follows:\n    *   Electric Dipole Radiation: Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴\n    *   Magnetic Dipole & Electric Quadrupole Radiation: Power ∝ ω⁶ ∝ λ⁻⁶\n    *   Higher-order poles: Power ∝ ω⁸, ω¹⁰, etc. ∝ λ⁻⁸, λ⁻¹⁰, etc.\n\n    In general, for a source of size *d* much smaller than the wavelength λ (*d* << λ), the lowest-order non-zero multipole moment provides the dominant contribution to the radiation. The problem describes a generic \"oscillating charge distribution\" in a spheroid. There is no information suggesting that the electric dipole moment is zero (which would require specific symmetries). Therefore, the most general and dominant form of radiation will be electric dipole radiation.\n\n2.  **Electric Dipole Radiation Analysis:**\n    For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, its dipole moment is given by **p**(t) = p₀cos(ωt) **ẑ**. The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) is given by:\n\n    dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴)/(32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)\n\n    where θ is the polar angle with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Wavelength (λ) Dependence:**\n    The function f(λ, θ) represents the radiated power per unit solid angle. From the formula above, we can see that the power is proportional to ω⁴. Since ω = 2πc/λ, the power is proportional to (1/λ)⁴ or λ⁻⁴.\n    This eliminates options A and D. The possible form of f involves λ⁻⁴.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Angular Dependence and Calculating the Fraction:**\n    The angular dependence of the power is given by the sin²(θ) term.\n    *   dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n\n    The maximum radiated power, A, occurs when sin²(θ) is at its maximum value, which is 1. This happens at θ = 90° (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    *   A = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ 1\n\n    We need to find the fraction of A radiated at an angle θ = 30°. Let P(θ) be the power at angle θ.\n    *   P(30°) = (dP/dΩ) at 30° ∝ sin²(30°)\n\n    The fraction is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power A:\n    *   Fraction = P(30°)/A = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = sin²(30°) / 1\n\n    We know that sin(30°) = 1/2.\n    *   Fraction = (1/2)² = 1/4\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4, and a possible form of the radiated power function f has a dependence of λ⁻⁴.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nWe can use a short python script to confirm the calculation of the fraction.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_degrees = 30.0\n\n# Convert angle from degrees to radians for Python's math functions\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# Calculate sin(theta)\nsin_theta = math.sin(theta_radians)\n\n# The fraction of maximum power is sin(theta)^2\nfraction = sin_theta**2\n\n# Print the result as a fraction\nprint(f\"The fraction is {fraction}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe fraction is 0.25\n</execute_result>\n\nThe code output confirms that the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.\n\nThus, the fraction is 1/4 and the form is λ⁻⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The most general and lowest-order type of radiation from such a source is electric dipole radiation.\n\n1.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    For an electric dipole, the total power radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴). Since the angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by ω = 2πc/λ (where c is the speed of light), the power is proportional to (1/λ)⁴ or λ⁻⁴. Therefore, the function f, representing the power per unit solid angle, will have a dependence of λ⁻⁴. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n2.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\n    where K is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the oscillation, frequency, and fundamental constants, and θ is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n3.  **Maximum Radiated Power (A):**\n    The radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at θ = 90° (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    So, the maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, A, is:\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K`\n\n4.  **Fraction of Power at θ = 30°:**\n    We need to find the power radiated at θ = 30° and express it as a fraction of the maximum power A.\n    The power at θ = 30° is:\n    `(dP/dΩ)_30° = K * sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `(dP/dΩ)_30° = K * (1/2)² = K/4`.\n\n    The fraction of the maximum power A is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n    `Fraction = (dP/dΩ)_30° / A = (K/4) / K = 1/4`\n\nCombining these results, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4, and a possible form for the dependence of the radiated power on wavelength is λ⁻⁴.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
