    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. This \"geometrical position\" refers to the Bloch vector **r** = (rx, ry, rz) that represents the state in the Bloch sphere.\n\n2.  **Recall the Bloch Sphere Representation:** Any single-qubit density matrix, ρ, can be represented by a point inside or on the surface of a unit sphere (the Bloch sphere). The position of this point is given by the Bloch vector **r**. The relationship between the density matrix and the Bloch vector is given by the formula:\n    ρ = ½(I + **r** ⋅ **σ**)\n    where:\n    *   I is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   **r** = (rx, ry, rz) is the Bloch vector.\n    *   **σ** = (σx, σy, σz) is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Density Matrix:**\n    The given density matrix is:\n    ρ = ½(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)\n\n4.  **Express the Given ρ in Matrix Form:**\n    *   First, we need the matrix representations of the basis states and the outer products.\n    *   In the computational basis, |0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ and |1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ.\n    *   Calculate the outer products:\n        *   |0⟩⟨0| = [1, 0]ᵀ * [1, 0] = [[1, 0], [0, 0]]\n        *   |1⟩⟨1| = [0, 1]ᵀ * [0, 1] = [[0, 0], [0, 1]]\n    *   Sum them up:\n        *   |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| = [[1, 0], [0, 0]] + [[0, 0], [0, 1]] = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n    *   This sum is the 2x2 identity matrix, I.\n    *   Therefore, the density matrix is:\n        *   ρ = ½ * I\n\n5.  **Solve for the Bloch Vector r:**\n    Now we have two expressions for ρ:\n    1.  ρ = ½ * I (from our calculation)\n    2.  ρ = ½(I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz) (the general formula)\n\n    By equating these two expressions, we get:\n    ½ * I = ½(I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz)\n\n    Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n    I = I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz\n\n    Subtracting I from both sides gives:\n    0 = rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz\n\n    Since the Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz) along with the identity matrix (I) form a basis for the space of 2x2 Hermitian matrices, they are linearly independent. This means the only way the linear combination `rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz` can equal the zero matrix is if all the coefficients (rx, ry, rz) are zero.\n\n    Therefore:\n    *   rx = 0\n    *   ry = 0\n    *   rz = 0\n\n    The Bloch vector is **r** = (0, 0, 0).\n\n6.  **Interpret the Result Geometrically:**\n    *   The vector **r** = (0, 0, 0) corresponds to the origin (the center) of the Bloch sphere.\n    *   This state is known as the *maximally mixed state*. It represents a qubit with maximum uncertainty, having an equal 50% probability of being measured as state |0⟩ or state |1⟩.\n    *   Pure states lie on the surface of the sphere (where |**r**| = 1), while mixed states lie inside the sphere (|**r**| < 1). The maximally mixed state is at the very center, where the \"mixedness\" is at its maximum (|**r**| = 0).\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) r=(0,0,1): This is the North Pole of the Bloch sphere, representing the pure state |0⟩.\n    *   B) r=(0,0,0): This is the center of the Bloch sphere and matches our calculated vector.\n    *   C) r=(1,1,0): This is not a valid Bloch vector for a single qubit because its magnitude is |**r**| = sqrt(1² + 1² + 0²) = sqrt(2) > 1. All physical states must have |**r**| ≤ 1.\n    *   D) r=(1,1,1): Similarly, this is not a valid Bloch vector as its magnitude is |**r**| = sqrt(1² + 1² + 1²) = sqrt(3) > 1.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The correct geometrical position is r=(0,0,0).\n\n<<<B>>>"
