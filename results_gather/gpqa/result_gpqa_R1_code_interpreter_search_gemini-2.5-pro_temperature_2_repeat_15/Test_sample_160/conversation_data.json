    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n    *   **λ1** is the mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2** is the mean free path (MFP) of beam electrons scattering off the same gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path (MFP) Formula**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, the moving particles (projectiles) are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules. Since both projectile and target populations are identical and moving according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, a correction factor of `√2` is introduced to account for their relative motion.\n    *   The formula for λ1 is:\n        **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)**\n    *   Here, `σ_gas` is the kinetic collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. This is related to the physical size of the molecules (e.g., their van der Waals radius).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a high-energy electron (1000 kV), and the target is a relatively slow-moving (or effectively stationary) gas molecule.\n    *   Because the electrons are moving much, much faster than the gas molecules, we can consider the gas molecules as stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` correction factor for relative motion of identical particle populations does not apply.\n    *   The formula for λ2 is:\n        **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)**\n    *   Here, `σ_e-gas` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2**\n    Let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)]\n    By simplifying the expression, we get:\n    **λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gas) / σ_e-gas**\n\n6.  **Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gas vs. σ_e-gas)**\n    *   **σ_gas**: This represents the kinetic cross-section. It's the effective area that one molecule presents to another for a collision to occur. It's related to the physical size of the electron shells.\n    *   **σ_e-gas**: This represents the scattering cross-section. A 1000 keV electron is extremely energetic. It can pass through the electron cloud of an atom without significant deflection. To be scattered, it needs to interact strongly with the nucleus or the inner-shell electrons. This means the effective target area an atom presents to a high-energy electron is generally *smaller* than the kinetic target area it presents to another, much slower molecule.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude that **σ_gas > σ_e-gas**. This means the ratio `(σ_gas / σ_e-gas)` is greater than 1.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion**\n    *   We have the relationship: λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gas / σ_e-gas).\n    *   We know that `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    *   We also established that `(σ_gas / σ_e-gas) > 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `λ2 / λ1 > √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    *   This definitively means that `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect, as our analysis shows λ2 must be greater than 1.414*λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. Since our result is that `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`, it certainly satisfies the condition `λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1`. The number 1.22 is a lower bound that is well within the physically derived result.\n\nIn summary, the mean free path for an electron is longer for two reasons:\n1.  The electron is treated as a fast projectile hitting stationary targets, which removes the `√2` factor from the denominator (increasing MFP by ~41%).\n2.  The high-energy electron has a smaller scattering cross-section than the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules, further increasing its mean free path.\n\n<<<D>>>"
