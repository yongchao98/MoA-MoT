    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the given spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n        *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, indicating it is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, indicating it is adjacent to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   Now let's analyze the alkyl group signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons means a CH₃ group is next to a CH₂ group.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the CH₂ group. It is next to the CH₃ group (from the triplet) and also a CH group.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons means a CH₃ group is next to a CH group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the CH group. It is bonded to the benzene ring (making it benzylic, hence the shift to 2.9 ppm), a CH₃ group (from the doublet), and a CH₂ group (from the multiplet at 1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. Connecting them through the CH and CH₂ groups gives a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, the structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a -COOH group and a sec-butyl group. This is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This compound matches the description for option D.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   The reaction is the treatment of Compound X with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   This combination (Red P / HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carbonyl groups (ketones, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) to the corresponding alkanes (-CH₂-).\n    *   The reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The rest of the molecule (the benzene ring and the sec-butyl group) is unreactive under these conditions.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Product: The -COOH group on the benzene ring is replaced by a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n    *   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n\nThe predicted final product, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
