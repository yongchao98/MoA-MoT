    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n1.  **Define the Reference Frames:**\n    *   Let S be the laboratory reference frame (the observer's frame).\n    *   Let S' be the reference frame in which the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light inside the glass, as measured in its own rest frame (S'), is given by the definition of the index of refraction `n`. The speed of light in this frame, let's call it `u'`, is `u' = c/n`.\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`. Therefore, `u' = 1/n`. Since the light beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving, `u'` is positive.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the speed of the object (the light beam) as observed in the laboratory frame S. This is what we need to find.\n    *   `u'` is the speed of the object in the moving frame S'. We found `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   `v` is the speed of the moving frame S' relative to the stationary frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in vacuum, which is `1`.\n\n4.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Substitute the known values into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n    Simplify the expression:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To remove the fractions within the main fraction, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The derived result `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
