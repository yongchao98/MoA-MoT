    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Potential**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often beneficial to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates (x, y), especially if it simplifies or becomes separable.\n\n**2. Convert to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nFrom these, we can see that x² = r² cos²(θ). Now, substitute these relations into the potential equation:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x²)\n\nNow, group the terms with x² and y²:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx² + 3/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2) kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n**3. Recognize the Form of the Potential**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky², is separable. This means it can be written as a sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y)\nwhere:\nVₓ(x) = 2kx²\nVᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThis is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n**4. The Quantum Harmonic Oscillator**\n\nThe energy spectrum for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) with a potential V(q) = 1/2 Kq² is given by:\nEₙ = ħω(n + 1/2), where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\nThe angular frequency ω is related to the effective spring constant K and mass m by ω = sqrt(K/m).\n\n**5. Decompose the Problem into Two 1D Oscillators**\n\nSince the potential is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the independent motions in the x and y directions:\nE = Eₓ + Eᵧ\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is Vₓ(x) = 2kx².\n    We compare this to the standard form Vₓ(x) = 1/2 kₓx².\n    1/2 kₓx² = 2kx²  =>  kₓ = 4k\n    The angular frequency for the x-motion is:\n    ωₓ = sqrt(kₓ/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    Eₙₓ = ħωₓ(nₓ + 1/2) = ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) * (nₓ + 1/2) = ħ * sqrt(k/m) * (2nₓ + 1)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky².\n    We compare this to the standard form Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 kᵧy².\n    1/2 kᵧy² = 1/2 ky²  =>  kᵧ = k\n    The angular frequency for the y-motion is:\n    ωᵧ = sqrt(kᵧ/m) = sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    Eₙᵧ = ħωᵧ(nᵧ + 1/2) = ħ * sqrt(k/m) * (nᵧ + 1/2)\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nNow, we sum the energies for the x and y motions to find the total energy spectrum:\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = [ħ * sqrt(k/m) * (2nₓ + 1)] + [ħ * sqrt(k/m) * (nᵧ + 1/2)]\n\nFactor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ (2nₓ + 1) + (nᵧ + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**7. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). Let's compare this with the options provided:\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nD) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
