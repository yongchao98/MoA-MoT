    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Product 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is an adamantane cage with two bromine atoms at bridgehead positions (C1 and C3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh, strongly basic conditions. Reactions at bridgehead carbons are difficult, suggesting that a non-standard mechanism or rearrangement is likely.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   A solid product with IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a characteristic frequency for a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum sums to 14 protons. The molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₄Br₂. The product likely has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O, which is consistent with the replacement of two bromine atoms by one oxygen atom (as C=O).\n*   **Analysis:** A simple substitution or elimination is not possible. The reaction is known to proceed through a highly strained intermediate called **1,3-dehydroadamantane**. This intermediate can then react with nucleophiles, and under certain conditions, can rearrange. The adamantane skeleton is known to rearrange to the more stable **protoadamantane** skeleton under acidic or other harsh conditions. A plausible product that fits the C₁₀H₁₄O formula and is a ketone is a protoadamantanone. The provided NMR data for Product 1 (especially the δ 4.79 ppm signal) is highly unusual for any simple adamantane or protoadamantane ketone and appears to be inconsistent with the subsequent reaction steps. It's best to deduce the structure based on the overall reaction sequence.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃.\n*   **Analysis:** This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. However, the next step is ozonolysis.\n*   The fact that Product 2 can undergo ozonolysis (Step 3) is a critical clue. Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). **Therefore, Product 2 must be an alkene.**\n*   How can a ketone (Product 1) be converted to an alkene (Product 2) using Al(O-iPr)₃? The most logical sequence is a two-step process occurring in the same pot:\n    1.  **MPV Reduction:** The ketone (Product 1) is reduced to the corresponding secondary alcohol.\n    2.  **Dehydration:** The resulting alcohol is dehydrated to form an alkene (Product 2). This dehydration is promoted by heating and the Lewis acidic nature of the aluminum alkoxide reagent.\n*   **Constraint:** Dehydration of an alcohol derived from **adamantan-2-one** would form adamantene. This alkene has a double bond at a bridgehead, which is a severe violation of Bredt's rule, making it extremely unstable and unlikely to be an isolable product.\n*   **Conclusion:** This strongly supports the hypothesis that the adamantane skeleton must have rearranged in Step 1 to a structure that can form a stable alkene. The **protoadamantane** skeleton allows for this.\n    *   Let's assume Product 1 is **protoadamantan-4-one**.\n    *   Reduction gives protoadamantan-4-ol.\n    *   Dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol can form **protoadamant-4-ene** by forming a double bond between C4 and C5. This alkene does not violate Bredt's rule and is stable.\n    *   Therefore, **Product 2 is protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene).\n\n### Step 3: Identify Product 3 and Analyze its NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis.\n*   **Analysis:** Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. Since the carbons of the double bond each have one hydrogen atom, the product will be a dialdehyde. The reaction opens one of the rings of the tricyclic system.\n*   The ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-ene is known to yield **cis-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dicarbaldehyde**.\n    ```\n    (Protoadamant-4-ene) C₁₀H₁₄ --(1. O₃; 2. DMS)--> (cis-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dicarbaldehyde) C₁₀H₁₄O₂\n    ```\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** This molecule has a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core. In its preferred chair-chair conformation, it possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry, making the two halves of the molecule equivalent. The two aldehyde (-CHO) groups at positions C2 and C6 are chemically equivalent.\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   We need to find the coupling pattern of the **most deshielded hydrogen atom**, excluding the aldehyde protons (which are exchangeable with D₂O and are indeed the most deshielded overall, ~9-10 ppm).\n    *   The next most deshielded protons on the carbon skeleton will be the ones alpha to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. These are the methine protons on C2 and C6 (H-2 and H-6). Due to the C₂ symmetry, H-2 and H-6 are chemically equivalent.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the bulky -CHO group at C2 will prefer an equatorial position. Consequently, the proton at C2 (H-2) will be in the **axial** position.\n    *   Now, we analyze the neighbors of the axial H-2 to determine its splitting pattern:\n        1.  **H-1:** The proton on the adjacent bridgehead carbon (C1). The dihedral angle H(ax)-C2-C1-H1 leads to a **small** coupling constant (J).\n        2.  **H-3axial:** The axial proton on the adjacent methylene carbon (C3). The dihedral angle H(ax)-C2-C3-H(ax) is approximately 180° (trans-diaxial). This results in a **large** axial-axial coupling constant (J_ax-ax).\n        3.  **H-3equatorial:** The equatorial proton on C3. The dihedral angle H(ax)-C2-C3-H(eq) is approximately 60°. This results in a **small** axial-equatorial coupling constant (J_ax-eq).\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** H-2 is coupled to three other protons with coupling constants J_large, J_small1, and J_small2. It is very likely that the two small coupling constants (to H-1 and H-3eq) are similar in magnitude (J_small1 ≈ J_small2).\n    *   The large coupling to H-3ax will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   Each peak of this doublet will then be split by the other two protons (H-1 and H-3eq). Since these two protons have similar small coupling constants, they will act as a group and split the signal into a **triplet** (1:2:1 pattern).\n    *   The overall resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
