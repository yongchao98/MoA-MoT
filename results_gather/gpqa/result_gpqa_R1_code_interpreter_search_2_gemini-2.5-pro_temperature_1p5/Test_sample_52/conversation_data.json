    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **Compound Type:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** \"absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group\" confirms the presence of a –COO– functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Aromatic Region:** \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is a strong indicator of a *para*-substitution pattern (1,4-disubstituted) on the benzene ring. An unsymmetrical ortho or meta substitution would give four signals. A symmetrical para substitution gives two signals. This means we have 4 aromatic protons in total, divided into two chemically different sets.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Vinyl Region:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. The splitting pattern described (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a propenyl group, specifically **–CH=CH–CH₃**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃`.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and by the three protons of the CH₃ group into a quartet. This results in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   Proton H(a) is only split by H(b), resulting in a doublet.\n        *   This fragment accounts for two vinyl proton signals and one of the methyl group signals.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Alkyl Region:** \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\". One of these methyl signals belongs to the propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃) identified above. The second methyl signal must belong to the only other part of the molecule we know: the ester group. For an ester to contain a methyl group and no CH₂ groups, it must be either a methyl ester (**–COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**–OOCCH₃**).\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Key Constraint:** \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\" This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possibilities.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n    Based on the analysis, we can assemble the pieces:\n    *   A *para*-substituted benzene ring: **p-C₆H₄**\n    *   A propenyl group: **–CH=CH–CH₃**\n    *   An ester group containing a methyl group: either **–COOCH₃** or **–OOCCH₃**\n\n    Let's combine these fragments. The two possible structures are:\n    *   **Structure I:** Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate\n    *   **Structure II:** 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate\n\n    Both structures perfectly fit all the given spectroscopic data (para-disubstituted ring, ester, propenyl group signals, two distinct methyl signals, and no CH₂ signals).\n\n3.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n\n    Now, we calculate the molecular formula for the structure we've deduced. Since both possible structures are isomers, they will have the same formula.\n\n    Let's count the atoms in Structure I (Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate):\n    *   **Benzene ring (C₆H₄):** 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n    *   **Propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃):** 3 Carbons, (1+1+3) = 5 Hydrogens\n    *   **Methyl ester group (–COOCH₃):** (1+1) = 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total:**\n        *   Carbons (C) = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n        *   Hydrogens (H) = 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n        *   Oxygens (O) = **2**\n\n    The chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify Against the Options:**\n\n    The calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches one of the given options. Let's briefly check why the others are incorrect.\n\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (DBE=6):** This is our derived formula. The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is 6 (4 for the ring, 1 for C=C, 1 for C=O), which matches the structure.\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (DBE=5):** Has two more hydrogens than our structure. Adding two hydrogens would require removing a double bond. Saturating the propenyl's C=C bond would create a propyl group (–CH₂CH₂CH₃), which introduces forbidden –CH₂– signals.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (DBE=7):** Has an extra C and an extra degree of unsaturation. It's not possible to add a carbon and a double bond/ring to our structure without violating the NMR constraints (e.g., creating a tri-substituted ring or adding more vinyl signals).\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DBE=6):** Has the same DBE as our structure but contains an additional C and 2H (a CH₂ unit). Adding a CH₂ unit is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data. For example, changing the methyl ester to an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃) would yield this formula but would also show a –CH₂– signal.\n\n    Therefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>"
