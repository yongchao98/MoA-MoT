    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials, V and A, generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that due to the finite speed of light, the potentials at a field point `r` at time `t` depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 1. Define Key Quantities\n\n*   **q**: The electric charge.\n*   **`s(t)`**: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n*   **`r`**: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   **`tr`**: The retarded time. It's the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observation point `r` at time `t`. It is defined by the implicit equation:\n    `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n*   **`s(tr)`**: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   **`d`**: The vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point.\n    `d = r - s(tr)`\n*   **d**: The magnitude of `d`, i.e., the distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n    `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`\n*   **`v`**: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    `v = d(s)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   **c**: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   **ε₀**: The permittivity of free space.\n*   **μ₀**: The permeability of free space.\n\nFrom the definition of `tr`, we can write `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials Formulation\n\nThe general formulas for the scalar potential V and vector potential A for a time-varying charge density `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\n### 3. Application to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are represented using Dirac delta functions:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas requires careful evaluation due to the delta function's argument containing the integration variable implicitly through the retarded time. A standard derivation in electromagnetism textbooks (for example, by integrating over time `t'` first) yields the following results:\n\nThe integral for the scalar potential evaluates to:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot v/c))]`\nwhere `\\hat{d} = d / d`.\n\nThe integral for the vector potential evaluates to:\n`A(r,t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot v/c))]`\n\nAll quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, `\\hat{d}`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. Simplification and Comparison with Options\n\nLet's simplify the denominator of these expressions:\n`d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot v/c) = d(1 - (d/d) \\cdot (v/c)) = d - (d \\cdot v)/c`\n\nNow, we can rewrite the potentials:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d \\cdot v)/c)]`\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d \\cdot v)] = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d \\cdot v))`\n\nSimilarly for the vector potential A:\n`A(r,t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - (d \\cdot v)/c)]`\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n`A(r,t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qcv / (dc - d \\cdot v)] = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π(dc - d \\cdot v))`\n\nNow let's compare these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** `V(...) = ... / (dc + d·v)`, `A(...) = ... / (dc + d·v)`. The sign is incorrect. This would correspond to advanced potentials, not retarded potentials.\n*   **B)** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`. This matches our derived expressions perfectly.\n*   **C)** `V = q / (4πε₀r)`. This is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge. It ignores the effects of retardation and the velocity-dependent term in the denominator.\n*   **D)** `V = q / (4πε₀r)`, `A = (v²/c²)V`. The potential V is incorrect, and the expression for A is vectorially incorrect (`v²` is a scalar).\n\nThus, the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
