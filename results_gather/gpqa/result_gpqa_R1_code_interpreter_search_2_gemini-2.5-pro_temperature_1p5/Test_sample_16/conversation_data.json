    "Here's my reasoning process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:**\n    The problem involves the Ca-EDTA complex, which exists in equilibrium with its constituent ions, Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. The formation reaction is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The problem starts with a solution of the complex, so it's more intuitive to consider the *dissociation* reaction, which is the reverse:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant:**\n    The problem provides the formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as KCa-EDTA):\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, the equilibrium constant is the dissociation constant, $K_d$, which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:**\n    We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$         |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$       |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\n4.  **Apply the equilibrium expression and solve for x:**\n    Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n    So, we have the equation:\n    $\\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n    Since the formation constant $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the dissociation constant $K_d$ is very small ($2 \\times 10^{-11}$). This means the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, x will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n\n    We can make a simplifying assumption: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$. This simplifies the equation significantly:\n    $\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the value of x:**\n    Now, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.02 \\times (2 \\times 10^{-11})$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\n    To make the calculation easier, let's write $4 \\times 10^{-13}$ as $40 \\times 10^{-14}$.\n    $x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    Since $\\sqrt{36}=6$ and $\\sqrt{49}=7$, $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.3.\n    $x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x.\n\n    To be precise, I will use a calculator.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial concentration of the complex\nC_complex = 0.02  # M\n\n# Formation constant\nKf = 5e10\n\n# Dissociation constant\nKd = 1 / Kf\n\n# We need to solve x^2 / (C_complex) = Kd\n# x = sqrt(Kd * C_complex)\nx_squared = Kd * C_complex\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This question asks for the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Write the dissociation equilibrium reaction.**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, will dissociate into its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Determine the appropriate equilibrium constant.**\n    The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or KCa-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    For the dissociation reaction we wrote in step 1, we need the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume no initial $Ca^{2+}$ or $EDTA^{4-}$. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, this will produce 'x' concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ and 'x' concentration of $EDTA^{4-}$.\n\n| Species | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | 0.02 M | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 M | +x | x |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$ | 0 M | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Use the equilibrium constant expression to solve for x.**\n    Now, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for $K_d$:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n    Because $K_d$ is very small, we know that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than 0.02, and we can make the approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the value of x.**\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x. The calculated value $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M is closest to option A. The Python code execution confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
