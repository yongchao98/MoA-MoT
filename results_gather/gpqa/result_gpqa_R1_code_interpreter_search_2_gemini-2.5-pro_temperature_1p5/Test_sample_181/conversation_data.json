    "This question requires an understanding of the physical principles and assumptions behind the Mott-Gurney law for space-charge-limited current (SCLC). Let's break down the conditions required for this law to be valid.\n\n1.  **The Nature of the Current (SCLC):** The term \"space-charge-limited\" implies that the current is not limited by the ability of the contact to inject charge carriers, but rather by the buildup of charge (space charge) within the device. This space charge creates an electric field that opposes the further injection of carriers, thus limiting the current.\n\n2.  **Carrier Injection:** For the SCLC regime to be established, carriers must be easily injected from the electrode into the semiconductor. This requires an **Ohmic contact**, which is defined as a contact with no (or a negligible) energy barrier for carrier injection. A Schottky contact, on the other hand, has a rectifying barrier and would lead to injection-limited current, not space-charge-limited current. The phrase \"no carrier injection barrier\" is a more general way of stating the requirement of an Ohmic contact.\n\n3.  **Type of Carriers:** The Mott-Gurney equation in its standard form, $J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$, is derived by considering the transport of only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). Therefore, it applies to a **single-carrier device**. If both electrons and holes were mobile and injected (a two-carrier device), carrier recombination would occur, and the device physics would be more complex, described by different models (e.g., Lampert-Rose model).\n\n4.  **Material Properties (Traps):** The given equation is the ideal, simplified version of the SCLC theory. It assumes that the semiconductor material is an ideal insulator or intrinsic semiconductor with no defect states (traps) in the bandgap that can capture and immobilize the injected carriers. The presence of traps would alter the J-V relationship, typically leading to a voltage dependence greater than $V^2$ in the trap-filling regime. Thus, the equation is valid for a **trap-free** material.\n\n5.  **Transport Mechanism:** The model assumes that the dominant transport mechanism for the injected carriers is **drift** under the influence of the applied electric field. The current arising from the concentration gradient of carriers (**diffusion current**) is assumed to be negligible. This is a valid assumption for devices where the length L is much larger than the thermal diffusion length and the applied voltage is sufficiently high (V >> kT/e).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on these five points:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This statement is incorrect because the SCLC is fundamentally a **drift current**. The diffusion current is negligible, not the drift current.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This statement is incorrect because a **Schottky contact** creates an injection barrier, which contradicts the primary condition for SCLC. SCLC requires an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier).\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly identifies all the key assumptions:\n    *   **Trap-free:** Correct.\n    *   **Single-carrier device:** Correct.\n    *   **No carrier injection barrier:** Correct (this is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact for SCLC).\n    *   **Negligible diffusion current:** Correct (drift current dominates).\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This statement is incorrect because the standard Mott-Gurney law applies to a **single-carrier** device, not a two-carrier device where recombination would be significant.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the most accurate and complete description of the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
