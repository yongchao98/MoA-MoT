    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The reaction starts with dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the highly acidic α-carbon located between the two carbonyl groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH3)2`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** The electrophile is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-CH3C6H4-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH3`.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate addition (1,4-addition).\n    1.  `⁻CH(COOCH3)2` attacks the β-carbon (the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n    2.  This forms a new carbon-carbon bond and a new enolate intermediate: `p-CH3C6H4-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH⁻-COOCH3`.\n    3.  This intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n*   **Product Structure (A):** The final product structure is `p-CH3C6H4-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n*   **Nomenclature of Product A:** Let's analyze the names provided in the options. The product is an ester of a tricarboxylic acid.\n    -   Let's consider the structure corresponding to the name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. The parent acid is `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid`, which has the structure `(HOOC)2CH-CH2-CH2-COOH`. Adding a `p-tolyl` group at the C2 position gives `(HOOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOH`. The trimethyl ester of this acid is `(MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOMe`. This structure perfectly matches the product we derived from the reaction mechanism.\n    -   The name `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate` would correspond to the structure `p-tolyl-CH2-CH(COOMe)-CH(COOMe)2`, which would result from a different, incorrect regiochemistry of addition.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The nucleophile is `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine`. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are effective nucleophiles, with the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) being the nucleophilic center. This type of reaction is known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** The electrophile is `(E)-but-2-enenitrile`, with the structure `CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    2.  This forms a C-C bond and an intermediate containing an iminium ion (on the cyclohexane ring) and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    3.  After proton transfer, an iminium salt is formed. The substituent added to the cyclohexane ring is `-CH(CH3)CH2CN`.\n    4.  The final step is acidic workup (`H3O+`), which hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product Structure (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with a `-CH(CH3)CH2CN` group.\n*   **Nomenclature of Product B:** We can name this compound as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain has four carbons including the nitrile carbon. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent.\n    -   `N≡C(1)-CH(2)2-CH(3)(substituent)-C(4)H3`.\n    -   The substituent is at position 3 and is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    -   Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    -   The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer of the product. The acidic workup favors the formation of the more stable keto form.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Knowns:** The reaction involves an unknown reactant C, `but-3-en-2-one` (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), and a base (KOH), to produce `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Michael addition where reactant C is the nucleophile (Michael donor) and MVK is the acceptor. Let's work backward from the product.\n    -   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system with a substituent at C2.\n    -   **Substituent:** The substituent is `-(CH2)-(CH2)-C(=O)-CH3`, which is a `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    -   **Michael Acceptor:** This `3-oxobutyl` group is formed from the Michael acceptor, MVK (`CH2=CH-CO-CH3`), after it accepts a nucleophile at its terminal `CH2` group and is then protonated.\n    -   **Michael Donor:** The C-C bond is formed between the `3-oxobutyl` group and the C2 position of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring. This means the nucleophile was the enolate derived from reactant C, and the attack occurred from the C2 position.\n*   **Reactant C Structure:** The acidic protons in the product's ring are at C2 (pKa ~5), flanked by two carbonyls. The base (KOH) deprotonates C to form the nucleophilic enolate. Therefore, reactant C must be the parent ring system before the substituent is added.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The alternative, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is an enol tautomer (`3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one`). The stable starting material is the diketone.\n\n### Final Check:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of compounds matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
