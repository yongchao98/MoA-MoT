    "This problem requires us to determine which of the listed stars can be detected by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a VLT 8m telescope with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Limiting Magnitude of ESPRESSO\n\nFirst, we need to find the faintest apparent magnitude a star can have to be considered \"detectable\" under the given conditions. We use the information provided in the ESPRESSO overview link.\n\nThe ESPRESSO \"in a nutshell\" section states a key performance metric:\n- **Limiting magnitude (V) for S/N=10 per pixel at 550nm in a 15-minute exposure is approximately V=16.5 mag.**\nThis is for the 1-UT mode (a single 8m VLT telescope), which matches the problem statement.\n\nThe question specifies a 1-hour (60-minute) exposure. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) scales with the square root of the exposure time (t) and is inversely proportional to the brightness of the star (flux, F).\nS/N ∝ F * √t\n\nLet's denote the reference conditions with subscript 'ref' and the conditions in our problem with subscript 'new'.\n- t_ref = 15 minutes\n- V_ref = 16.5 mag\n- S/N_ref = 10\n- t_new = 60 minutes\n- V_new = ?\n- S/N_new = 10\n\nSince the S/N ratio is the same in both cases (10), we can write:\nS/N_ref = S/N_new\nC * F_ref * √t_ref = C * F_new * √t_new  (where C is a proportionality constant)\nF_ref * √15 = F_new * √60\nF_new / F_ref = √15 / √60 = √ (15/60) = √ (1/4) = 1/2\n\nThe relationship between magnitude (V) and flux (F) is given by:\nV_new - V_ref = -2.5 * log10(F_new / F_ref)\nV_new - 16.5 = -2.5 * log10(1/2)\nV_new - 16.5 = -2.5 * (-0.301)\nV_new - 16.5 = 0.753\nV_new ≈ 17.25 mag\n\nTherefore, a star is detectable if its apparent V magnitude is **V ≤ 17.25 mag**.\n\n### Step 2: Check Star Visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nESPRESSO is located at the Paranal Observatory in Chile, in the Southern Hemisphere. We must ensure the listed stars are visible from this location.\n- **Latitude of Paranal:** Approximately 24.6° South.\n\nA star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC). Stars with very high northern declinations are not visible from the southern hemisphere. A reasonable limit for observation is that a star should rise at least 30° above the horizon. For Paranal, this corresponds to a declination range of approximately **DEC between +35° and -90°**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe now evaluate each star against the visibility and magnitude criteria.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n- **Apparent Magnitude (V):** -0.74 mag.\n- **Declination (DEC):** -52.7°.\n- **Visibility:** The declination is within the observable range. **Visible**.\n- **Detectability:** V = -0.74 is much brighter (smaller magnitude) than the limit of 17.25. **Detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n- **Apparent Magnitude (V):** +1.98 mag.\n- **Declination (DEC):** +89.3°.\n- **Visibility:** Polaris is the North Star. Its declination is far outside the observable range from Paranal. **Not Visible**.\n- **Detectability:** Since it's not visible, it cannot be detected. **Not Detectable**.\n\n**c), d), e), f): Hypothetical Stars**\nThese stars are all at **RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg**.\n- **Visibility:** A declination of 0° (the celestial equator) is easily visible from Paranal. **All are visible**.\n\nNow we calculate the apparent magnitude (V) for each, using their absolute magnitude (M_V = 15) and distance (d) with the distance modulus formula:\n**V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5**\nV = 15 + 5 * log10(d) - 5\n**V = 10 + 5 * log10(d)**\n\nWe compare the calculated V with our limit of 17.25.\n\n**c) Star at d = 10 pc**\n- V = 10 + 5 * log10(10) = 10 + 5 * 1 = **15.0 mag**\n- 15.0 ≤ 17.25. **Detectable**.\n\n**d) Star at d = 200 pc**\n- V = 10 + 5 * log10(200) ≈ 10 + 5 * 2.301 = 10 + 11.505 = **21.5 mag**\n- 21.5 > 17.25. **Not Detectable**.\n\n**e) Star at d = 5 pc**\n- V = 10 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 10 + 5 * 0.699 = 10 + 3.495 = **13.5 mag**\n- 13.5 ≤ 17.25. **Detectable**.\n\n**f) Star at d = 50 pc**\n- V = 10 + 5 * log10(50) ≈ 10 + 5 * 1.699 = 10 + 8.495 = **18.5 mag**\n- 18.5 > 17.25. **Not Detectable**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLet's summarize the detectable stars:\n- a) Canopus: **Yes**\n- b) Polaris: No\n- c) Star at 10 pc: **Yes**\n- d) Star at 200 pc: No\n- e) Star at 5 pc: **Yes**\n- f) Star at 50 pc: No\n\nIn total, 3 stars from the list are detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
