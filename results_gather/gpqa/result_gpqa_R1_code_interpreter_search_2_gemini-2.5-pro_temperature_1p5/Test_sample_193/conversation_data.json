    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), we need to sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible microstates in total.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as:\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\nwhere the sum is over all 8 possible states.\n\nLet's list all the possible states (S1, S2, S3), calculate the energy E for each state, and then determine the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE).\n\nThere are two main energy levels that the system can occupy, determined by the spin configurations.\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\nThis corresponds to two states:\n1.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E1 = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n2.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E2 = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nSo, there are 2 states with energy E = -3J.\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis corresponds to the remaining 6 states:\n3.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n    E3 = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n4.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n    E4 = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n5.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n    E5 = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n6.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n    E6 = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n7.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n    E7 = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n8.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n    E8 = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nSo, there are 6 states with energy E = J.\n\nNow, we can write the partition function Z by summing the Boltzmann factors for all states. We can group the states by their energy and degeneracy (number of states with the same energy).\n\n*   Energy E1 = -3J, with degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   Energy E2 = J, with degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nD) Z= 2e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
