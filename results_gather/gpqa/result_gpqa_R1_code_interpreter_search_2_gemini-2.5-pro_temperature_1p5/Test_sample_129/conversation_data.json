    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum redshift `z` at which a specific spectral line, the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line, becomes observable by ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n1.  **Identify the key wavelengths:**\n    *   The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line (λ₀) is given as ~1216 Ångströms (Å). This is in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   Ground-based telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most light at ultraviolet wavelengths. The atmosphere only becomes transparent in the \"optical window,\" which starts at the very blue/violet end of the visible spectrum. The practical lower limit for wavelength observability from the ground is typically considered to be around 3500 Å to 4000 Å, depending on the observatory's altitude and atmospheric conditions.\n\n2.  **Understand Redshift:**\n    *   Redshift (`z`) describes how much the wavelength of light from a distant object is stretched due to the expansion of the universe.\n    *   The relationship between the rest wavelength (λ₀) and the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is given by the formula: λ_obs = λ₀ * (1 + z).\n\n3.  **Set up the problem:**\n    *   We need to find the *minimum* redshift (`z_min`) that will stretch the Lyα line's wavelength from λ₀ = 1216 Å to a wavelength that is just inside the observable optical window (λ_obs_min).\n    *   So, we need to solve for `z` in the equation: λ_obs_min = λ₀ * (1 + z).\n    *   Rearranging the formula gives: z = (λ_obs / λ₀) - 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate the required observed wavelength for each option:**\n    We can test each of the given redshift options to see which one shifts the 1216 Å line to a wavelength that matches the lower limit of the ground-based optical window (~3500-4000 Å).\n\n```python\n# Rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha in Angstroms\nlambda_rest = 1216\n\n# Redshift options\noptions = {\n    'A': 1.2,\n    'B': 2.4,\n    'C': 1.9,\n    'D': 3.0\n}\n\n# Calculate the observed wavelength for each option\nfor key, z in options.items():\n    lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z)\n    print(f\"For option {key} (z = {z:.1f}), the observed wavelength is {lambda_obs:.1f} Angstroms.\")\n\n```\n<execute_result>\nFor option A (z = 1.2), the observed wavelength is 2675.2 Angstroms.\nFor option B (z = 2.4), the observed wavelength is 4134.4 Angstroms.\nFor option C (z = 1.9), the observed wavelength is 3526.4 Angstroms.\nFor option D (z = 3.0), the observed wavelength is 4864.0 Angstroms.\n</execute_result>\n\n5.  **Analyze the results:**\n    *   **A) z = 1.2:** The observed wavelength is ~2675 Å. This is still deep in the ultraviolet range and would be completely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. It is not detectable from the ground.\n    *   **B) z = 2.4:** The observed wavelength is ~4134 Å. This is in the violet part of the visible spectrum and is well within the range of ground-based telescopes. This is a possible redshift, but maybe not the *lower limit*.\n    *   **C) z = 1.9:** The observed wavelength is ~3526 Å. This wavelength is right at the edge of the atmospheric cutoff (the beginning of the near-UV/blue window). It is a plausible value for the *minimum* redshift required for detection. Any object with a redshift slightly lower than this would have its Lyα line shifted to a wavelength that is blocked by the atmosphere.\n    *   **D) z = 3.0:** The observed wavelength is ~4864 Å. This is in the blue-green part of the spectrum and is easily detectable. It is a possible redshift for such an object, but it is not the *lower limit*.\n\nBased on this analysis, the redshift of 1.9 shifts the Lyman-alpha line to the very edge of what is observable from the ground, making it the best estimate for the lower limit among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Rest Wavelength (λ₀):** The problem states that the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Ångströms. This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identify the Observational Constraint:** Ground-based telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most light at wavelengths shorter than the visible spectrum. The atmospheric \"optical window\" begins at approximately 3500 Å to 4000 Å in the very blue/violet part of the spectrum. For a spectral line to be detected from the ground, its observed wavelength must be greater than this atmospheric cutoff. Let's use ~3500 Å as a practical lower limit for the observed wavelength (λ_obs).\n\n3.  **Apply the Redshift Formula:** The relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs), the rest wavelength (λ₀), and the redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n    λ_obs = λ₀ * (1 + z)\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:** We can use the code output to see which redshift value shifts the 1216 Å line to a wavelength that is just above the atmospheric cutoff of ~3500 Å. The question asks for the *lower limit* on the redshift.\n\n    *   **A) z = 1.2:** Observed wavelength = 2675.2 Å. This is still in the ultraviolet range and is completely absorbed by the atmosphere. It is not detectable from the ground.\n    *   **B) z = 2.4:** Observed wavelength = 4134.4 Å. This is in the violet part of the visible spectrum and is well within the observable range. It is a possible redshift, but perhaps not the *lowest* possible.\n    *   **C) z = 1.9:** Observed wavelength = 3526.4 Å. This wavelength is just at the edge of the atmospheric cutoff. This is the minimum redshift, among the options provided, that would shift the Lyα line enough to be seen from the ground.\n    *   **D) z = 3.0:** Observed wavelength = 4864.0 Å. This is in the blue-green part of the spectrum and is easily detectable. However, it is not the *lower limit*.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The redshift of 1.9 is the smallest value among the choices that shifts the Lyman-alpha line to an observable wavelength (~3526.4 Å). Therefore, it represents the best estimate for the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detected with ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n<<<C>>>"
