    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a moving particle presents to a target particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze λ1 (Gas-Molecule on Gas-Molecule Collision):**\n    *   In this case, the moving particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules of the same type.\n    *   Let's denote the diameter of a gas molecule as `d`. When two identical spherical molecules collide, the centers of the two molecules must be within a distance `d` of each other. The effective area for this collision, or the collision cross-section (σ₁), is the area of a circle with radius `d`. So, σ₁ = πd².\n    *   However, because all particles (both projectile and target) are in constant, random motion, a correction factor of √2 is introduced to account for the average relative velocity between them.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule is:\n        **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)**\n\n3.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron on Gas-Molecule Collision):**\n    *   In this case, the moving particles are electrons, and the target particles are the stationary gas molecules.\n    *   The number density `n` of the gas molecules remains the same, as the pressure and temperature of the gas in the compartment have not changed.\n    *   The projectile is an electron, whose physical size is negligible compared to a gas molecule. We can treat it as a point particle.\n    *   The target is a gas molecule of radius `r = d/2`. A collision occurs if the point-like electron's path comes within the radius `r` of the center of the gas molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule (σ₂) is simply the cross-sectional area of the molecule itself: σ₂ = πr² = π(d/2)² = **πd²/4**.\n    *   Since the electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, their velocity is extremely high (close to the speed of light) and vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. We can therefore consider the gas molecules to be effectively stationary targets. The √2 correction factor for relative motion is not needed.\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of an electron in the gas is:\n        **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂) = 1 / (n * πd²/4) = 4 / (n * π * d²)**\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Now, we establish a ratio between λ₂ and λ₁:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = [ 4 / (n * π * d²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²) ]\n    *   The terms `n`, `π`, and `d²` cancel out:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = 4 * √2\n    *   Since √2 is approximately 1.414, the ratio is:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n    *   This gives us the relationship:\n        **λ₂ ≈ 5.656 * λ₁**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁. Let's evaluate the given options based on this result:\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect. Our result shows λ₂ is much larger than 1.22*λ₁.\n    *   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is correct. Since λ₂ ≈ 5.656 * λ₁, it is clearly greater than or equal to 1.22*λ₁.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect. The underlying physics shows they are different.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. An electron, being much smaller, is less likely to collide, leading to a longer mean free path.\n\nThe key insight is that an electron is a much smaller \"projectile\" than a gas molecule, and the target gas molecules are effectively stationary relative to the high-speed electron. Both factors lead to a significantly longer mean free path for the electron (λ₂) compared to the gas molecule (λ₁).\n\n<<<B>>>"
