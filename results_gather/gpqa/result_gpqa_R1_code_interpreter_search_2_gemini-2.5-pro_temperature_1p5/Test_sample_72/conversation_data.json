    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given two astronauts with specified rest masses and relativistic velocities.\n    *   Astronaut 1: Rest mass `m₁ = 2m`, velocity `v₁ = 0.6c` in the positive x-direction.\n    *   Astronaut 2: Rest mass `m₂ = 3m`, velocity `v₂ = 0.5c` in the positive x-direction.\n    *   The goal is to find two quantities: the relative speed between them (`v_rel`) and the total energy of the system (`E`).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Relative Speed (`v_rel`):**\n    *   Since the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light, `c`), we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. For two objects moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n        `v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n    *   Substitute the given velocities `v₁ = 0.6c` and `v₂ = 0.5c`:\n        `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c²/c²)`\n        `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n        `v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n        `v_rel = (1/7)c`\n    *   Convert the fraction to a decimal:\n        `v_rel ≈ 0.142857... c`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Energy (`E`):**\n    *   The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the individual astronauts.\n        `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by `E = γ * m_rest * c²`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of Astronaut 1 (`E₁`):**\n    *   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ₁` for astronaut 1:\n        `v₁ = 0.6c`\n        `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   Now, calculate the energy `E₁`:\n        `m₁ = 2m`\n        `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy of Astronaut 2 (`E₂`):**\n    *   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for astronaut 2:\n        `v₂ = 0.5c`\n        `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 1 / 0.866 = 1.1547`\n    *   Now, calculate the energy `E₂`:\n        `m₂ = 3m`\n        `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy of the System (`E_total`):**\n    *   Sum the individual energies:\n        `E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²`\n        `E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc² = 5.9641 mc²`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated relative speed is `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n    *   The calculated total energy is `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n    *   These values match option D. The generated Python code also confirms these results.\n\n<<<D>>>"
