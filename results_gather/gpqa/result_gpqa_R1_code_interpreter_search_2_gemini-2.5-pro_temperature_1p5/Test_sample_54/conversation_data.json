    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet with an integration of 3 protons at this chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon, specifically an acetate group (CH₃-COO-). This suggests the molecule is an acetate ester.\n\n    2.  **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet with an integration of 3 protons indicates a methyl group (CH₃-) that is adjacent to a carbon with only one proton on it (-CH-). The chemical shift of ~1.6 ppm is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n\n    3.  **Combination of 2 and 1:** Having an allylic methyl group (doublet) implies a structure fragment like CH₃-CH=. This fits with a \"propenyl\" group (CH₃-CH=CH-). It does not fit with a \"butenyl\" group like CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-, which would have an ethyl group (a triplet and a quartet), not a methyl doublet.\n\n    4.  **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** A doublet of quartets with an integration of 1 proton. This signal corresponds to a vinylic proton (-CH=). The \"quartet\" part of the splitting arises from coupling to the adjacent methyl group (the CH₃ at 1.6 ppm), according to the n+1 rule (3+1=4 lines). The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to another single proton, which must be the other vinylic proton. So, this proton is part of the CH₃-CH=CH- fragment.\n\n    5.  **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** A doublet with an integration of 1 proton. The chemical shift of 7.0 ppm is in the vinylic region and is significantly downfield (deshielded), which is typical for a vinylic proton attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an oxygen atom (=CH-O-). The splitting is a doublet because it's only coupled to the other vinylic proton.\n\n    6.  **The Coupling Constant (J value):** The key piece of information is the coupling constant, J = 16.0 Hz. The magnitude of the coupling constant between two protons on a double bond is stereochemically dependent:\n        *   **Trans** coupling constants (J_trans) are typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis** coupling constants (J_cis) are smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n        Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, this indicates a **trans** relationship between the two vinylic protons.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    *   The acetate group is confirmed by the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n    *   The propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-) is confirmed by the methyl doublet at 1.6 ppm and the corresponding vinylic proton (doublet of quartets) at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   The trans stereochemistry of the double bond is confirmed by the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) of the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound that fits all the data is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nStructure of Trans-propenyl acetate and proton assignments:\n```\n      H(a)     H(b)\n       \\      /\n        C === C\n       /      \\\n    CH3(c)      O-CO-CH3(d)\n\nH(a): 5.5 ppm (dq)\nH(b): 7.0 ppm (d, J = 16.0 Hz)\nH(c): 1.6 ppm (d)\nH(d): 2.1 ppm (s)\n```\nThe coupling between H(a) and H(b) is J = 16.0 Hz, confirming the trans configuration.\n\n<<<D>>>"
