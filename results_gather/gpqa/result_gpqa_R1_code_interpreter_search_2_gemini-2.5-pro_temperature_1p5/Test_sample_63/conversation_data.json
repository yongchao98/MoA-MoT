    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental results and determine the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a powerful drying agent (desiccant) that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds directly to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The problem states the weight did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced in the reaction.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in mass of the tube is due to the oxygen that reacted. Therefore, the mass of O₂ produced is 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After removing H₂O and O₂, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (at STP) remained. This gas did not react with a desiccant, a base, or hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salts.**\n    *   The original mixture of salts A and B decomposed to form H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N) atoms. Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Moles of H atoms:** From 0.20 mol of H₂O, we have 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of N atoms:** From 0.10 mol of N₂, we have 0.10 * 2 = 0.20 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of O atoms:** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n        *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol O.\n        *   From O₂: 0.025 * 2 = 0.05 mol O.\n        *   Total moles of O = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n    *   **Verify the total mass:** Let's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial 7.20 g.\n        *   Mass = (0.40 mol H * 1 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N * 14 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O * 16 g/mol)\n        *   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This confirms that salts A and B contain only N, H, and O.\n\n3.  **Identify salts A and B.**\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning moles of A = moles of B.\n    *   Let's look at the overall atomic ratio in the combined A+B mixture: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20: 4 : 8 : 5.\n    *   So, for every 4 nitrogen atoms in the mixture, there are 8 hydrogen atoms and 5 oxygen atoms. The combined empirical formula of the A+B pair is (N₄H₈O₅).\n    *   Let's consider common salts containing N, H, and O. Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) are prime candidates.\n        *   Formula of NH₄NO₃: N₂H₄O₃\n        *   Formula of NH₄NO₂: N₂H₄O₂\n    *   If we add the atoms from one formula unit of each, we get:\n        *   N: 2 + 2 = 4\n        *   H: 4 + 4 = 8\n        *   O: 3 + 2 = 5\n    *   This gives the exact N₄H₈O₅ ratio we found. This strongly suggests that salt A is NH₄NO₃ and salt B is NH₄NO₂ (or vice versa).\n\n4.  **Confirm the identification with given masses and moles.**\n    *   Let n be the moles of NH₄NO₃ and n be the moles of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = n * (M(A) + M(B)) = n * (80 + 64) = 144n.\n    *   144n = 7.20 g  =>  n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Let's check if the decomposition of these amounts yields the observed products.\n        *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n            *   0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₃: The products are N₂, O₂, and H₂O. The reaction must be 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n            *   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ (which is 0.025 times the \"2 mol\" unit in the equation):\n            *   Produces (0.025 * 2) = 0.05 mol N₂.\n            *   Produces (0.025 * 1) = 0.025 mol O₂.\n            *   Produces (0.025 * 4) = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n    *   **Total products:**\n        *   N₂ = 0.05 (from B) + 0.05 (from A) = 0.10 mol. (Matches)\n        *   H₂O = 0.10 (from B) + 0.10 (from A) = 0.20 mol. (Matches)\n        *   O₂ = 0 (from B) + 0.025 (from A) = 0.025 mol. (Matches)\n    *   The identification is correct.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (meaning in one formula unit of each salt).\n    *   Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Moles of H2O from mass increase of tube 1\nmoles_H2O = 3.60 / 18.015\n# Moles of O2 from mass increase of tube 3\nmoles_O2 = 0.80 / 31.998\n# Moles of Gas C (N2) from volume at STP\nmoles_N2 = 2.24 / 22.4\n\n# Total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture\nmoles_H = moles_H2O * 2\nmoles_N = moles_N2 * 2\nmoles_O = (moles_H2O * 1) + (moles_O2 * 2)\n\n# Based on these moles (~0.2 N, ~0.4 H, ~0.25 O), the atomic ratio is N:H:O = 4:8:5\n# This corresponds to a combination of NH4NO3 (N2H4O3) and NH4NO2 (N2H4O2).\n# Salt A = NH4NO3, Salt B = NH4NO2\n\n# Number of atoms in one formula unit of Salt A (NH4NO3)\natoms_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3  # N + H4 + N + O3\n\n# Number of atoms in one formula unit of Salt B (NH4NO2)\natoms_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2  # N + H4 + N + O2\n\n# Total number of atoms\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",

The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 1.008*2 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted. So, 0.80 g of O₂ was produced.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ ≈ 16.00*2 = 32.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After removing H₂O and O₂, 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). The gas did not react with a desiccant, a base, or hot copper. This suggests a non-reactive gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n    *   **Summary of Products:** The decomposition of salts A and B produced 0.20 mol of H₂O, 0.025 mol of O₂, and 0.10 mol of N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\n    Since the products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂, the original salts must contain the elements Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Let's calculate the total amount of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Total moles of H atoms:** From 0.20 mol H₂O, there are 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol of H.\n    *   **Total moles of N atoms:** From 0.10 mol N₂, there are 0.10 * 2 = 0.20 mol of N.\n    *   **Total moles of O atoms:** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n        *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol of O.\n        *   From O₂: 0.025 * 2 = 0.05 mol of O.\n        *   Total moles of O = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol of O.\n\n    *   **Verify Mass:** Let's check if the masses of these elements sum to the initial mass.\n        *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.008 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.007 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.00 g/mol)\n        *   Mass ≈ 0.403 g + 2.801 g + 4.000 g ≈ 7.204 g. This confirms the composition.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n\n    We have an equimolar mixture of two salts containing N, H, and O. The overall mole ratio of atoms in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simpler integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n\n    Let's consider common salts containing these elements. Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) are excellent candidates as they are known to decompose upon heating to produce the observed gases.\n    *   Formula of Salt A: NH₄NO₃ (empirical formula N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   Formula of Salt B: NH₄NO₂ (empirical formula N₂H₄O₂)\n\n    If we combine one formula unit of each, the total atomic composition is:\n    *   N: 2 + 2 = 4\n    *   H: 4 + 4 = 8\n    *   O: 3 + 2 = 5\n    This gives the ratio N₄H₈O₅, which exactly matches our experimental finding. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n4.  **Confirm with Stoichiometry**\n\n    Let's verify that the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts produces the correct amount of products. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt in the mixture.\n    *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   From n moles of NH₄NO₂, we get n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n    *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrate: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n        *   From n moles of NH₄NO₃, we get n moles of N₂, n/2 moles of O₂, and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\n    *   Total moles of products:\n        *   N₂: n + n = 2n\n        *   O₂: n/2\n        *   H₂O: 2n + 2n = 4n\n\n    *   From our results, we know total moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol. So, 2n = 0.10 mol, which means n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Let's check this value with the other products:\n        *   Expected O₂ = n/2 = 0.05/2 = 0.025 mol. (Matches)\n        *   Expected H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (Matches)\n\n    *   Finally, let's check the total mass:\n        *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g\n        *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n        *   Total mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. (Matches)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
