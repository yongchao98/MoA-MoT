    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring (the 7-oxa part). The `[4.1.0]` bridge notation confirms this structure. Let's label the carbons of the cyclohexane ring C1 through C6, with the epoxide linking C1 and C6. The oxygen is atom 7.\n    *   It is substituted with methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The absolute configurations of the four stereocenters (C1, C3, C4, C6) are given as (1R), (3R), (4R), and (6S), respectively.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate).\n    *   This is a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe problem provides two key rules for the reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** \"The alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\" This means the reaction is sterically controlled.\n2.  **Stereospecificity:** \"Inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile (Nu) is added.\" This indicates an Sₙ2-type mechanism. The nucleophile performs a backside attack on one of the epoxide carbons, breaking the C-O bond.\n\n**3. Apply the Rules to the Specific Reaction**\n\n*   **Step 3a: Determine the site of nucleophilic attack (Regioselectivity).**\n    *   The nucleophilic methyl group can attack either C1 or C6 of the epoxide ring.\n    *   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons.\n        *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group (`1-methyl...`).\n        *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom (since it's not mentioned otherwise and is a stereocenter).\n    *   A methyl group is much larger than a hydrogen atom. Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Determine the product's carbon skeleton.**\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, and the epoxide ring opens. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup (which is implicit), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The original methyl groups were at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n    *   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. The numbering proceeds around the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The original C6, now bearing a new methyl group, is adjacent to the new C1, so it will be numbered C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a 2,2,4,5-substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1. We are left with options A and D.\n\n*   **Step 3c: Determine the stereochemistry of the product.**\n    *   The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the point of attack (C6) and retention of configuration at all other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4).\n    *   The starting configurations are: (1R), (3R), (4R), (6S).\n    *   The configurations of the stereocenters that are not attacked are retained:\n        *   C1 remains (R). In the product, this is **1R**.\n        *   C4 remains (R). In the product, this is **4R**.\n        *   C3 remains (R). In the product, this is C5, and its configuration remains **R**.\n    *   Now, we must determine the configuration of the new stereocenter at C2 (the original C6). The starting configuration at C6 is (S). The Sₙ2 reaction causes an inversion of configuration.\n    *   **Detailed analysis of the inversion at C6:** A simple switch from (S) to (R) is only guaranteed if the substituent priorities do not change order. Here, the leaving group (O, priority #1) is replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, which will have a lower priority than C1 and the other ring carbon). Thus, we must determine the final configuration based on the geometry of the attack.\n        *   The reaction is a backside attack. To determine the stereochemistry, we first need to know the orientation of the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen). The configuration at C6 is (S). The substituents in order of priority are O > C1 > C5 > H. For C6 to be (S), with the lowest priority group (H) pointing away from the viewer (dash/alpha), the path O → C1 → C5 must be counter-clockwise. This means the epoxide oxygen is pointing toward the viewer (wedge/beta).\n        *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the back side, i.e., from the alpha face (dash).\n        *   The inversion at C6 pushes the original H from the alpha face to the beta face (wedge).\n        *   So, in the product, the new stereocenter C2 (original C6) has the new methyl group on the alpha face (dash) and the original hydrogen on the beta face (wedge).\n        *   Let's assign the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog configuration to this new center (C2). The substituents are C1 (bearing OH and Me), C3 (CH₂), the new Me, and H. The priority order is C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n        *   The lowest priority group (H) is on the beta face (wedge). According to the CIP rules, when the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer, the configuration is the reverse of what the path indicates.\n        *   Tracing the path from highest to lowest priority (C1 → C3 → Me), we observe a clockwise (CW) direction on the ring.\n        *   Since the lowest priority group (H) is wedge, we reverse the result: CW becomes (S).\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 in the product is **(S)**.\n\n*   **Step 3d: Assemble the final product name.**\n    *   Combining the configurations of all stereocenters in the product: (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n    *   The full IUPAC name is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThis name and configuration match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
