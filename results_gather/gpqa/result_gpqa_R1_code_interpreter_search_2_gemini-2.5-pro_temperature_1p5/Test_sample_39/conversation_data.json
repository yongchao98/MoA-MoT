    "This is a common piece of jargon used in organic chemistry labs. Let's break down why one answer is much more likely than the others.\n\n*   **Context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. A major part of synthetic chemistry is not just making the desired compound, but also purifying it by separating it from unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and solvents.\n*   **The Phrase:** \"On top of each other\" is a visual and spatial metaphor. It implies that in the chosen method of analysis or separation, the different compounds are occupying the same space, making them indistinguishable and inseparable.\n*   **Common Separation Technique:** The most common technique for both monitoring reactions and purifying products in an organic chemistry lab is **chromatography**, particularly Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography.\n    *   In chromatography, compounds are separated based on their differential interaction with a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This interaction is primarily governed by the **polarity** of the compounds.\n    *   When a chemist runs a TLC plate, they spot the mixture on the bottom and let the solvent run up the plate. The compounds travel up the plate at different rates depending on their polarity, appearing as distinct spots.\n    *   If two compounds have very **similar polarities**, they will travel at nearly the same rate. Their spots on the TLC plate will overlap, appearing literally \"on top of each other.\" This is a common source of frustration because it signals that separating the mixture using a standard chromatography column will be very difficult or impossible.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this understanding:\n\n*   **A) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** While true that all molecules interact this way, it's not the specific meaning of the phrase. It doesn't describe a failed separation in the way a chemist would.\n*   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This is the correct interpretation. As explained above, similar polarities cause compounds to co-elute in chromatography, meaning their spots or fractions will overlap. This perfectly matches the phrase \"on top of each other.\"\n*   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** This would make them difficult to separate by distillation. However, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more characteristic of chromatography slang than distillation slang. A chemist would more likely say \"they co-distill\" or \"they form an azeotrope.\"\n*   **D) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a property used for characterization, not typically for separation in a standard lab setting. Two very different, easily separable compounds can have similar or identical optical rotations (e.g., both being zero). This is the least likely answer.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is complaining that their purification by chromatography is failing because the compounds have nearly identical polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
