    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the initial state and the dilution process.**\n\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ (or 20.00 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   This solution is diluted by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   First, we need to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid solution that will be titrated.\n    *   Initial volume (V₁) = 20.00 mL\n    *   Initial concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n    *   Final volume (V₂) = 20.00 mL + 20.00 mL = 40.00 mL\n    *   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, we find the final concentration (M₂):\n        *   (0.05 M) * (20.00 mL) = M₂ * (40.00 mL)\n        *   M₂ = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n*   So, we are titrating 40.00 mL of 0.025 M acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\n*   At any point before the equivalence point, we have a mixture of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which forms a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   Where HA is the acid (CH₃COOH) and A⁻ is the conjugate base (acetate, CH₃COO⁻).\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   At \"25% titration\", it means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form the conjugate base, acetate. This means 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n*   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75 or 1/3.\n*   Now, substitute these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\n*   First, we need to find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (V_eq), where moles of acid = moles of base.\n    *   Moles of acid = M_acid * V_acid = (0.025 mol/L) * (0.0400 L) = 0.001 mol\n    *   V_eq = Moles of acid / M_base = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 mL\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains 0.001 mol of CH₃COO⁻.\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.050 L\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻] is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction. We can find it from Ka using the ion product of water, Kw (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C):\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now we can find the [OH⁻] concentration using the Kb expression. Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = x² / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, so the equation simplifies to:\n    *   Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Finally, we calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n\n**4. Consolidate Results and Choose the Answer**\nTo perform the calculations precisely, we can use a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05 # M\ninitial_vol_acid = 20.0 # mL\nvol_water_added = 20.0 # mL\nconc_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\nfinal_vol_acid = initial_vol_acid + vol_water_added\nfinal_conc_acid = (initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid) / final_vol_acid\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% titration ---\n# Use Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at equivalence point ---\n# Moles of acid to be titrated\nmoles_acid = final_conc_acid * (final_vol_acid / 1000)\n# Volume of base to reach equivalence point\nvol_base_eq = (moles_acid / conc_base) * 1000 # in mL\n# Total volume at equivalence\ntotal_vol_eq_L = (final_vol_acid + vol_base_eq) / 1000\n# Concentration of the conjugate base [A-]\nconc_A_minus = moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n# Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\n# pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe pH at 25% titration is 4.26\nThe pH at the equivalence point is 8.52\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step calculation, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations performed are as follows:\n\n**1. Dilution Calculation**\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume after adding water (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration of acetic acid (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n*   At 25% titration, a buffer solution exists where 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), and 75% remains as HA.\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25 / 75 = 1/3.\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n*   First, determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n    *   Moles of acid = M₂ * V₂ = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   At equivalence, moles of base = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, creating a basic solution: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb = Kw / Ka.\n    *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Set up an equilibrium calculation to find [OH⁻] (let x = [OH⁻]):\n    *   Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] = x² / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Assuming x is small, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
