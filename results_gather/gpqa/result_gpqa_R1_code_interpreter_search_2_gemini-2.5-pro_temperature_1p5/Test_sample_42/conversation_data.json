    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule**\n\n*   The molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority.\n*   Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant **C1**.\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure from the Positional Descriptions**\n\nLet's place the groups on the benzene ring based on the information provided. We'll start numbering from the carboxylic acid at C1.\n\n*   **Parent:** Benzoic acid (-COOH at C1).\n*   **Para Group:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is **C4**. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n*   **Ortho Groups:** A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are **C2** and **C6**. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 occupy the C2 and C6 positions.\n*   **Meta Groups:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano (-CN) group are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions to C1 are **C3** and **C5**. So, -CHO and -CN occupy the C3 and C5 positions.\n\nAt this point, the skeleton is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: -CN and -CHO\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Fix the Positions**\n\nThe final and most crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" (Note: \"alcohol\" refers to the hydroxyl group, and \"nitrile\" refers to the cyano group).\n\n*   We know the methoxy group is at **C4**. For the methoxy group to be *ortho* to the cyano group, the cyano group must be at **C3** or **C5**.\n*   We know the hydroxyl group is at **C2** or **C6**.\n*   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n    *   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C5.** For the hydroxyl group to be *ortho* to C5, it would need to be at C4 or C6. It can't be at C4 (methoxy is there), so it must be at C6. But the methoxy group at C4 is *meta*, not ortho, to the cyano at C5. So this case is incorrect.\n    *   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C3.** The methoxy group at C4 is *ortho* to C3. This works. For the hydroxyl group to also be *ortho* to C3, it must be at **C2** or C4. It can't be at C4, so it must be at **C2**. This works.\n\nThis confirms the following positions:\n*   **C2:** Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   **C3:** Cyano (-CN)\n\nFrom this, the remaining positions are determined:\n*   The dimethylamino group must be at the other ortho position, **C6**.\n*   The formyl group must be at the other meta position, **C5**.\n\nThe final, unambiguous structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (hydroxy)\n*   **C3:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Naming and Numbering Rules**\n\n*   **Numbering:** The numbering is already set (C1 for -COOH). We need to confirm the direction (clockwise in our deduction) is correct. The IUPAC rule for tied locant sets is to give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   Substituents: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n    *   Alphabetical Order: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy. (Note: \"dimethylamino\" is alphabetized under 'd').\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". Our structure places it at C3. If we numbered counter-clockwise, the hydroxyl would be at C6 and the cyano group would be at C5. Since 3 < 5, our clockwise numbering is correct.\n\n*   **Assemble the Name:** List the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number.\n\n    1.  3-cyano\n    2.  6-(dimethylamino)  *(parentheses are used for complex substituents)*\n    3.  5-formyl\n    4.  2-hydroxy\n    5.  4-methoxy\n\n*   **Final Name:** Combine the alphabetized substituents with the parent name:\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect locants and order)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect locants and order)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
