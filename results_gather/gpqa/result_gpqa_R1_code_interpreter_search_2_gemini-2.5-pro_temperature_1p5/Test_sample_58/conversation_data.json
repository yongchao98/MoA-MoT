    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The approach involves a stoichiometric calculation of the neutralization reactions followed by the calculation of the pH from the concentration of the remaining dominant species (excess acid or base).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of acids and bases.**\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of H+ ions from the acids and OH- ions from the base. The total volume of the final solution is also determined.\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Moles of H+ from HCl = 0.08 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely, releasing two moles of OH- for every mole of Ba(OH)2: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-.\n    *   Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n*   **Total Volume of the final solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\nNeutralization reactions occur in a specific order: strong acid reacts with a strong base first. Any excess strong acid or base then reacts with the weak species.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid (H+ from HCl) vs. Strong Base (OH- from Ba(OH)2)**\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- = 0.18 mol\n    *   The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.\n    *   The H+ ions are the limiting reactant. They will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = Initial OH- - Reacted OH- = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base (OH-) vs. Weak Acid (CH3COOH)**\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.10 mol\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.\n    *   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-).\n    *   Moles of OH- in excess = OH- remaining - Reacted OH- = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of CH3COO- formed = 0.05 mol\n\n**Step 3: Determine the pH of the final solution.**\nThe final solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH- (a strong base) and 0.05 moles of CH3COO- (a weak base) in a total volume of 1.2 L. The pH of the solution will be predominantly determined by the concentration of the strong base (OH-), as its contribution to the overall hydroxide concentration is much greater than that of the weak base.\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   In aqueous solutions at 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.38\nB) 12.62\nC) 8.92\nD) 8.68\n\nThe calculated pH matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
