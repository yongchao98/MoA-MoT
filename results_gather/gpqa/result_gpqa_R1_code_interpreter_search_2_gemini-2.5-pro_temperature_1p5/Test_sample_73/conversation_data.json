    "This problem deals with radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The key characteristic of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\".\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Model the Decay Process:**\n    Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, and the time until a single decay event occurs follows an exponential distribution. The probability that an atom survives past a time `t` is given by the survival function:\n    `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `T` is the time of decay and `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability that the atom decays *within* a time `t` is:\n    `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    Subtracting 1 from both sides and multiplying by -1 gives:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n    We can solve for `λ` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n    `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability.\n    Let `T` be the time of decay. We want to find:\n    `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`\n    which is `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    A crucial feature of exponential decay is the memoryless property. It means that the future probability of decay is independent of how long the atom has already survived. Mathematically, for any times `s` and `t`:\n    `P(T > s + t | T > s) = P(T > t)`\n\n    Applying this to our problem, the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    So, `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)` is equivalent to `P(T ≤ 150)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We need to calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes:\n    `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    We can substitute the value of `λ` we found:\n    `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)`\n    `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^([ln(0.68)] * 1.5)`\n    Using the property `e^(a*ln(b)) = b^a`:\n    `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (e^ln(0.68))^1.5`\n    `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Now, we compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to calculate 1 - (0.68)^1.5\nprobability = 1 - (0.68)**1.5\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage_probability = probability * 100\n\nprint(f\"The probability is {percentage_probability:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe computed probability is approximately 43.93%. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 40%\nB) 48%\nC) 52%\nD) 44%\n\nThe closest option is 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem is about the probability of radioactive decay, which is a classic example of a process that can be modeled by an exponential distribution. The key feature of such a process is that it is \"memoryless.\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Decay Model**\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` without decaying is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability of the atom decaying within time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n*   P(100) = 0.32\n*   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n*   e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTo find `λ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n*   -100λ = ln(0.68)\n*   λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This can be written as a conditional probability: `P(decay in next 150 mins | survived 50 mins)`.\n\nRadioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of a future event does not depend on the history of the process. The atom does not \"age\" or \"get tired.\" Therefore, the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n\nSo, the question simplifies to finding the probability that the atom will decay in any given 150-minute interval.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes, `P(150)`.\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstitute the expression for `λ` we found in Step 2:\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n\nUsing the logarithm property `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\n\nSince `e^ln(x) = x`:\n*   P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nUsing a calculator (as was done by the Python code):\n*   0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n*   P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get 43.93%.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Options**\nThe calculated probability is 43.93%, which is closest to the given option D) 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
