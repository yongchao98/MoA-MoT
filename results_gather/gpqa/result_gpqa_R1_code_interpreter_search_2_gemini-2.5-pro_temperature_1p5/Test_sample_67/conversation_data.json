    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\n*   The particle is spin-1/2. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (spinor).\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field.\n*   The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ ⋅ B`.\n*   The magnetic moment is given as `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator. So `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ_z B = -γB S_z`.\n*   The eigenvalues of the `S_z` operator are `+ħ/2` (spin-up, `|↑⟩_z`) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down, `|↓⟩_z`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E = -γB (±ħ/2)`.\n*   For the magnetic moment to be \"aligned\" with the field, the particle must be in its lowest energy state. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive, the lowest energy `E = -γB(ħ/2)` corresponds to the spin-up state, `S_z = +ħ/2`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is the spin-up state in the Z-direction:\n    `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z`. In the standard basis where `|↑⟩_z = [[1], [0]]`, this is the initial state vector.\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the `+Y` direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B' = -μ_y B = -γB S_y`.\n*   The state of the system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n*   Substituting the Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n*   The spin operator `S_y` can be written in terms of the Pauli matrix `σ_y`: `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n    `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n*   The time evolution operator becomes `U(t) = exp(iγBt (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the State at Time `t`\n*   We need to evaluate the exponential of the Pauli matrix. A useful identity is `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_k`, where `σ_k` is any Pauli matrix and `I` is the identity matrix.\n*   In our case, `θ = γBt/2`. So, `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y`.\n*   Now we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z = [[1], [0]]`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(γBt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]) [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]) [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n*   In bra-ket notation, this is `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(γBt/2)|↓⟩_z`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Moment\n*   We want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z⟩`.\n*   `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   The operator `S_z` is `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n*   First, let's find `S_z|ψ(t)⟩`:\n    `S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]] = (ħ/2)[[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n*   Next, we calculate the inner product `⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`. The bra `⟨ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|ψ(t)⟩`, so `⟨ψ(t)| = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n*   Finally, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n*   The expression for `⟨μ_z⟩(t)` is a cosine function of time `t`.\n*   A general oscillation is of the form `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can identify the angular frequency `ω`.\n*   `ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the Z-axis, begins to precess around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`. The z-component of the spin therefore oscillates with this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
