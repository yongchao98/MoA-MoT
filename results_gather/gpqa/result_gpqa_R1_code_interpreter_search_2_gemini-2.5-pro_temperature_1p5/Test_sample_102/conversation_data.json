    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, including the directing effects of various substituents and the limitations of certain reactions like Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring substituted with three groups.\n*   The groups are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   Taking the acetyl group as being at position 1, the bromine is at position 3, and the nitro group is at position 5.\n*   This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all three groups are meta to each other.\n\n### Directing Effects of Substituents\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups is key to planning the synthesis:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced via nitration.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group (by induction) but an **ortho-, para-director** (by resonance). It is introduced via bromination.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** This is a strongly activating, **ortho-, para-director**. It is formed by reducing a nitro group.\n*   **Amide group (-NHCOCH3):** This is a moderately activating, **ortho-, para-director**.\n\n### Key Synthetic Constraints\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation Failure:** The Friedel-Crafts acylation (using CH3COCl/AlCl3 to add the acetyl group) does not work on benzene rings that are strongly deactivated. A ring with a nitro group (-NO2) is too deactivated for this reaction. This means the acetyl group must be added to the ring *before* the nitro group.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts on Amines:** Friedel-Crafts reactions also fail on rings containing an amino group (-NH2) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This results in N-acylation rather than the desired C-acylation on the ring.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each proposed reaction sequence based on these principles.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   Step i) starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene.\n*   Step vi) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This is attempted on a ring that has already been brominated (step v). However, the crucial flaw is that any sequence starting with nitration cannot later involve a successful Friedel-Crafts acylation of that nitrated ring. Moreover, the first four steps (i-iv) are nitration -> reduction to amine -> diazotization -> reduction with H3PO2, which converts the amino group back to -H. This sequence transforms benzene into nitrobenzene and then back into benzene, which is nonsensical. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This Friedel-Crafts acylation is a standard and effective first step.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director. Therefore, bromination occurs at the meta position (position 3), giving the correct intermediate.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. We have two directing groups: -COCH3 (meta-director) and -Br (o,p-director). The -COCH3 group directs the new -NO2 group to position 5. The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The powerful meta-directing effect of the acetyl group, combined with the deactivation of the ortho positions, makes position 5 the most likely site for nitration. Thus, this step successfully produces the target molecule.\n*   The first three steps of this sequence constitute a logical and viable synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) seem superfluous and chemically questionable, as they would modify the final product. However, compared to the other options, this sequence contains a valid pathway. It is common in such questions that one option has a correct core synthesis while others are fundamentally flawed.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   Step i) produces bromobenzene.\n*   Step ii) nitrates bromobenzene. Since -Br is an o,p-director, the major product is p-bromonitrobenzene, not the meta-isomer needed for the final product structure.\n*   Step iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene. This reaction will fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   Step i) forms nitrobenzene. Step ii) reduces it to aniline.\n*   Step iii) attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. As explained, this reaction fails or leads to N-acylation, not the required C-acylation to form an acetophenone derivative. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy eliminating options A, C, and D due to fundamental chemical errors (failed reactions or incorrect isomer formation), option B remains the only plausible choice. The first three steps of sequence B provide a direct and chemically sound route to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The extra steps listed are likely confusing distractors, but they do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful synthesis path.\n\n<<<B>>>"
