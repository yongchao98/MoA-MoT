    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Let its formula be CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass fraction H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n    *   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7. Let's test this: `1/7 ≈ 0.142857`.\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`. This gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen and is formed by hydrogenation. This means Z is a fully saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), both of which fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (C + D) under severe conditions gives only Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of C (which is Z) gives Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   Since D is part of a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine water, it's not a simple alkene/alkyne. The most plausible structure for D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. An aromatic ring only reacts with H₂ under severe conditions, which fits the problem description.\n    *   Therefore, Y is a mixture of a cycloalkane (Z = CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (D). The simplest aromatic series (benzene and its alkyl derivatives) has the formula CnH2n-6. Hydrogenation of D (CnH2n-6) adds 3 H₂ molecules to form the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n). This is consistent.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {CnH2n, CnH2n-6}.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X (A + B) gives only Z (CnH2n). This implies A and B have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y by heating with platinum in a disproportionation reaction. This is characteristic of hydrogen transfer reactions catalyzed by platinum. The most plausible reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer: A + B → C + D.\n    *   Since the reactant and product mixtures are equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1.\n        `A + B → C + D`\n        `A + B → (CnH2n) + (CnH2n-6)`\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of H atoms in one molecule of A and one of B must be the same as in one molecule of C and one of D.\n        `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   Since A and B are unsaturated precursors to the cycloalkane Z, they are likely a cycloalkene and a cycloalkadiene.\n        *   Cycloalkene (one double bond): CnH2n-2. Let's assign this to A.\n        *   Cycloalkadiene (two double bonds): CnH2n-4. Let's assign this to B.\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen balance with this assignment:\n        `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   This matches the hydrogen atoms on the product side. The reaction is:\n        `CnH2n-2 (A) + CnH2n-4 (B) → CnH2n (C) + CnH2n-6 (D)`\n        This represents the cycloalkene being hydrogenated to a cycloalkane, and the cycloalkadiene being dehydrogenated to an aromatic compound. This is a chemically sound model.\n\n4.  **Determine the Value of 'n' and the Final Answer**\n    *   We need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of A and one molecule of B. This is `4n - 6`.\n    *   The problem leaves 'n' ambiguous. Let's test the two most likely scenarios based on common solvents:\n        *   **Case n=6**: Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This is a very common solvent.\n            *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n            *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)}. Note: 1,4-cyclohexadiene is chosen because it is not conjugated, as required.\n            *   Total H atoms in X = 10 + 8 = 18. This corresponds to the formula `4n - 6 = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18`. This is option D.\n        *   **Case n=7**: Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄). Also a known solvent.\n            *   Mixture Y = {Methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), Toluene (C₇H₈)}.\n            *   Mixture X = {A methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂), a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀)}.\n            *   Total H atoms in X = 12 + 10 = 22. This corresponds to the formula `4n - 6 = 4(7) - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22`. This is option B.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Both the n=6 and n=7 scenarios are chemically consistent with all the facts given in the problem.\n    *   However, problems of this nature often refer to the most fundamental or textbook example of a reaction. The disproportionation involving the C₆ ring system (cyclohexene, cyclohexane, benzene) is the canonical example of Zelinsky catalysis.\n    *   Therefore, it is most probable that the question is based on the C₆ system.\n    *   Assuming n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in these two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nFinal calculation using the derived formula:\nFor n=6, Total H = 4(6) - 6 = 18."
