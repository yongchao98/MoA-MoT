    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Aperture:** An N-sided regular polygon where N is infinitely large.\n    *   **Dimension:** All apothems have length 'a'. The apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n    *   **Light:** Monochromatic light of wavelength λ, traveling along the z-axis (i.e., normal incidence).\n    *   **Phenomenon:** Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the angular distance between the first two minima.\n    *   **Approximation:** Small angle approximation (sin θ ≈ tan θ ≈ θ) is valid.\n\n2.  **Identify the Shape of the Aperture:**\n    *   A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides (N → ∞) converges to a circle.\n    *   As N → ∞, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius 'r' of the circle.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `r = a`.\n\n3.  **Recall Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    *   The far-field diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n    *   The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima. Their angular positions are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n    *   The condition for the minima is given by:\n        `sin(θ) = c * (λ / D)`\n        where:\n        *   `θ` is the angular position of the minimum.\n        *   `λ` is the wavelength of light.\n        *   `D` is the diameter of the aperture.\n        *   `c` is a numerical constant that depends on the order of the minimum.\n\n4.  **Determine the Positions of the Minima:**\n    *   The diameter of our circular aperture is `D = 2 * r = 2 * a`.\n    *   **First Minimum:** For the first dark ring, the well-established constant is `c₁ ≈ 1.220`. This value comes from the first non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x). The angular position `θ₁` is:\n        `sin(θ₁) = 1.220 * (λ / D) = 1.220 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n    *   **Second Minimum:** For the second dark ring, the constant is `c₂ ≈ 2.233`. This comes from the second non-zero root of the Bessel function. The angular position `θ₂` is:\n        `sin(θ₂) = 2.233 * (λ / D) = 2.233 * (λ / 2a) ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)`\n    *   Using the small angle approximation (`sin θ ≈ θ`), we have:\n        *   `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n        *   `θ₂ ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)`\n\n5.  **Interpret the Question:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the angular distance between the first two minima\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. Let's analyze the possible interpretations in the context of diffraction patterns.\n    *   **Interpretation A:** The angular position of the first minimum relative to the central maximum (at θ=0). This would be `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ / a`. This matches option A.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** The angular separation between the first and second minima on the same side of the central maximum. This would be `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.117 - 0.610) λ / a = 0.507 λ / a`. This is very close to option C (0.506 λ / a).\n    *   **Interpretation C:** The angular separation between the first minimum on one side of the center (at `+θ₁`) and the first minimum on the other side of the center (at `-θ₁`). The Airy pattern is symmetric. These are the two minima closest to the center, and thus can be described as \"the first two minima\". The distance between them defines the angular width of the central Airy disk. This distance would be `Δθ = θ₁ - (-θ₁) = 2θ₁`.\n        `2θ₁ ≈ 2 * (0.610 * λ / a) = 1.220 * λ / a`. This matches option D exactly.\n\n6.  **Select the Most Likely Interpretation:**\n    *   The angular width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`) is a very common and fundamentally important characteristic of a diffraction pattern, as it relates directly to the resolving power of the aperture (Rayleigh criterion).\n    *   Phrasing \"the angular distance between the first two minima\" is a very plausible, if slightly indirect, way of asking for the width of the central bright fringe. The \"first two minima\" are the ones that bound this central fringe.\n    *   Given that this interpretation leads to an exact match with option D (`1.220 λ/a`), it is the most probable intended meaning of the question. The other interpretations either represent a different physical quantity (Option A) or result in a slight numerical mismatch (Option C).\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum is `θ₁ = 0.610 * (λ / a)`.\n    *   The first two minima are located at `+θ₁` and `-θ₁`.\n    *   The angular distance between them is `2 * θ₁ = 2 * 0.610 * (λ / a) = 1.220 * (λ / a)`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
