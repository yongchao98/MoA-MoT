    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that occurs between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad and centered higher (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the C=O is part of a carboxylic acid functional group (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid** group and an **alkene** group.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene, supporting the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺):\n    *   Mass = (1 × Carbon) + (2 × Oxygen) + (1 × Hydrogen)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   The presence of a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45 is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### **4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Formulas**\n\nBased on the combined data, the unknown molecule must contain:\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which means it must have at least **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An alkene group (C=C).\n\nThis allows us to immediately eliminate options **A) C₆H₁₂O** and **B) C₆H₁₀O** because they only have one oxygen atom.\n\nNow, let's determine the **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)** for the remaining options. The DBE represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for 1 DBE.\n*   An alkene's C=C bond accounts for 1 DBE.\n*   Therefore, the correct structure must have a total DBE of at least 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\nThe formula for DBE is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)` (Oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options:\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   Contains two oxygens (consistent with -COOH).\n    *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This DBE of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data. (An example would be a hexenoic acid, like trans-2-hexenoic acid).\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   Contains two oxygens (consistent with -COOH).\n    *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DBE of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. There are no degrees of unsaturation left for a C=C double bond. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data, which confirm an alkene.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid, the presence of an alkene, and the required degree of unsaturation—is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
