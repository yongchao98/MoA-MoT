    "This problem is governed by the energy-time formulation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Principle:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Applying the Principle to the Problem:**\n    *   The \"lifetime\" (τ) of an excited state represents the time interval over which the state exists. We can associate this lifetime with the uncertainty in time, so Δt ≈ τ.\n    *   This finite lifetime means the energy of the state is not perfectly defined but has an inherent \"width\" or uncertainty, ΔE.\n    *   We can use the uncertainty principle to find the minimum energy width for each state: ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Determining the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   For two energy levels to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved,\" the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than their energy widths.\n    *   The system's resolvability is limited by the state with the larger energy width, which corresponds to the shorter lifetime. In this case, that is ΔE₁.\n    *   Therefore, the required condition is: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁.\n    *   |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    We need to find an energy difference from the options provided that is significantly larger than ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (This is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV   (This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy separation large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as their individual energy widths would not overlap.\n\nLet's verify the calculations with a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # sec\ntau2 = 1e-8  # sec\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Delta_E ~ h_bar / tau)\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# To be clearly resolved, the energy difference between the states must be greater than their energy widths.\n# The resolution is limited by the larger of the two widths.\nlarger_width = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\nprint(f\"The minimum energy separation required is greater than the larger width: {larger_width:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > larger_width:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than {larger_width:.3e} eV.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is not a possible energy difference as it is less than or equal to {larger_width:.3e} eV.\")\n\n```\nExecution output:\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nThe minimum energy separation required is greater than the larger width: 6.582e-07 eV\n\nChecking the options:\nOption A (1.0e-11 eV) is not a possible energy difference as it is less than or equal to 6.582e-07 eV.\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than 6.582e-07 eV.\nOption C (1.0e-08 eV) is not a possible energy difference as it is less than or equal to 6.582e-07 eV.\nOption D (1.0e-09 eV) is not a possible energy difference as it is less than or equal to 6.582e-07 eV.\n```\n\nThe calculation confirms that to resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Out of the given choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user's question is about determining the required energy difference to resolve two quantum states with given lifetimes. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:**\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) are related by:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nFor practical calculations, we often use the approximation:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nwhere ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width of Each State:**\n\nEach quantum state has a \"natural linewidth\" or uncertainty in its energy due to its finite lifetime.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Condition for Resolution:**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" these two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be larger than their respective energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁), which is the limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options:**\n\nWe need to check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷). The levels would be clearly separated.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would significantly overlap.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough for the two energy levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<B>>>"
