    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound (Compound X) from the provided IR and 1H NMR data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm-1 (broad):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring. It is likely an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet (bs) with a high chemical shift is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a characteristic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at the lower field (8.0 ppm) is adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the doublet at the higher field (7.2 ppm) is adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Analyzing the alkyl group signals:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is a -CH2-CH3 fragment (an ethyl group part).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methine group (-CH-). This is a -CH-CH3 fragment.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the -CH2- group. It's a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent -CH3 group (3 protons) and the -CH- group (1 proton).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the -CH- group. It is attached to the benzene ring (making it a benzylic proton, hence its downfield shift), the -CH3 group (at 1.4 ppm), and the -CH2- group (at 1.7 ppm). It's a multiplet due to coupling with all these neighboring protons.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Putting the fragments together [-CH2-CH3] and [-CH-CH3], with the -CH- being attached to the ring and also to the -CH2- group, we get the structure: -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3). This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Based on all the spectral data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D), which is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reaction and the final product.**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and HI**.\n*   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3). The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the I2 that is formed during the reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group on the benzene ring will be converted to a -CH3 group. The rest of the molecule, the sec-butyl group and the benzene ring, will remain unchanged.\n\n    **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid  ---(HI / Red P)--->  1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   The calculated final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n*   Let's check the options:\n    A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. The carboxylic acid is not reduced, and the alkyl group is different.\n    B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: **Correct.** This matches our predicted product.\n    C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is isobutyl, not sec-butyl.\n    D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X).\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
