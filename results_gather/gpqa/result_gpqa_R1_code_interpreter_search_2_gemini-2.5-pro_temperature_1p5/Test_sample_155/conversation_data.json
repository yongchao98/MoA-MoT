    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a C2 rotational axis of symmetry.\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition reaction (both C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the alkene double bond).\n    *   The reaction of mCPBA (an achiral reagent) with the achiral (E)-alkene can occur from two faces (top or bottom) with equal probability.\n    *   Attack on a trans-alkene yields a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Attack from the top face yields (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the bottom face yields (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, are enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the product of this step is a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric epoxides.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of water on the protonated epoxide, which proceeds with inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-like, anti-addition process).\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Water can attack either C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C5 results in inversion at C5 (R → S), while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C4 results in inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Now, let's analyze the product stereoisomers. (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has an internal plane of symmetry (when rotated into the correct conformation), making it a *meso* compound. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers. (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol is the same meso compound.\n    *   Similarly, the ring-opening of the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, will also exclusively yield the same meso-diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The syn-addition epoxidation of a cis-alkene yields a cis-epoxide.\n    *   Because the starting (Z)-alkene is achiral and symmetrical, epoxidation from either the top or bottom face results in the same single product: the meso epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This causes the anti-addition ring-opening of the meso-epoxide.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the meso (4R,5S)-epoxide. Water can attack either C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C5 results in inversion at C5 (S → R), while C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C4 results in inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since attack at C4 and C5 on the symmetrical protonated epoxide is equally probable, the products are formed in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound (4R,5S) is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak. So, the racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will produce one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**. The meso diol is a diastereomer of the other two and will have a different retention time.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   It can separate all stereoisomers with different spatial arrangements.\n    *   The three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture—(4R,5R)-diol, (4S,5S)-diol, and the meso (4R,5S)-diol—will all interact differently with the chiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three compounds, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
