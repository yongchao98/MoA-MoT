    "An oscillating spheroid-shaped charge distribution that is radiating can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when observed in the radiation zone (far-field). Let's assume the oscillation and the symmetry axis of the spheroid are both along the z-axis.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the Larmor formula, which is proportional to `sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n    \n    So, the radiated power per unit solid angle can be written as:\n    `f(λ, θ) = C(λ) * sin²(θ)`\n    where `C(λ)` is a function that depends on the wavelength `λ` and other constants.\n\n2.  **Maximum Radiated Power (A):**\n    The power `f(λ, θ)` is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis).\n    Therefore, the maximum power `A` is:\n    `A = f(λ, 90°) = C(λ) * sin²(90°) = C(λ) * (1)² = C(λ)`\n\n3.  **Power at θ = 30°:**\n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We can use the same formula:\n    `f(λ, 30°) = C(λ) * sin²(30°)`\n    \n    Since `A = C(λ)`, we can substitute it into the equation:\n    `f(λ, 30°) = A * sin²(30°)`\n\n    Now, we calculate the value of `sin²(30°)`:\n    `sin(30°) = 1/2`\n    `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\n    So, the power at 30° is:\n    `f(λ, 30°) = A * (1/4) = A/4`\n\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`. This narrows the possible choices to A and C.\n\n4.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    Now, we need to determine the dependence of the function `f` on the wavelength `λ`. The formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is:\n    `dP/dΩ = (<(dP/dΩ)>) = (ω⁴ p₀²) / (32π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\n    where:\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n    *   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πv = 2π(c/λ)`.\n    Let's look at the dependence of the power on `ω`:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    Substituting the relation `ω ∝ 1/λ`, we get:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\n    Thus, the radiated power per unit solid angle `f(λ, θ)` is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This phenomenon is also known as Rayleigh scattering, which describes the scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength of light and exhibits the same `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    Combining these two results, the correct option is the one that has both `1/4` and `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
