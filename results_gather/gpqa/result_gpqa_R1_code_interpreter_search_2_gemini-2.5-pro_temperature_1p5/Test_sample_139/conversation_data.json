    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W**\n        The gas W released has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine simple molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Deuterium (D or ²H) is an isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible, but less likely in this reaction context.\n        *   D₂ is the most plausible candidate for W, especially given the next clue.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance B**\n        Precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   This value is \"very close to 277 K\". Therefore, B is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction**\n        *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G.\n        *   Since heating G produces B (D₂O), G is likely a metal deuteroxide (a metal hydroxide with D instead of H). Example: M(OD)n.\n        *   The production of D₂ gas strongly suggests that both the reagent (X) and the liquid it reacts with (Y) are sources of deuterium. If X were a deuteride and Y were normal water (H₂O), the product would be HD gas, not D₂.\n        *   Therefore, the reaction is likely: `Deuterated Reagent (X) + Heavy Water (Y=D₂O) -> Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ gas (W)`. The violent nature of the reaction points towards X being a highly reactive deuterated compound, like a metal deuteride or a complex metal deuteride.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance X and its use**\n        *   X contains a heavier isotope (we've established this is Deuterium).\n        *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly suggests a common reagent pair like LiAlH₄ / LiAlD₄ or NaBH₄ / NaBD₄.\n        *   Let's test the most likely candidate: X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride). Its analog is LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminium Hydride), an extremely common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n        *   Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits the reaction:\n            `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n        *   This reaction is known to be violent. Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate (G). The gas produced is D₂ (W). This fits perfectly.\n        *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. This correctly produces B (D₂O).\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The Keto Acid Reaction**\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has two functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both groups to alcohols.\n        *   Ketone (>C=O) → Secondary alcohol (>CD-OH)\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) → Primary alcohol (-CD₂OH)\n        *   So, a keto acid like R-C(=O)-R'-COOH is reduced to a diol: R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH.\n        *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\n    *   We have identified Substance X as **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present in X. We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Comparing the elements:\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1)\n        *   Middle element: Lithium (Atomic Number 3)\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminium (Atomic Number 13)\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all Hydrogen (Deuterium) atoms and all Aluminium atoms. For this calculation, we use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n          Total mass from Hydrogen atoms = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The most common and stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n          Total mass from Aluminium atoms = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass** = (Total mass from lightest element) + (Total mass from heaviest element)\n        Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
