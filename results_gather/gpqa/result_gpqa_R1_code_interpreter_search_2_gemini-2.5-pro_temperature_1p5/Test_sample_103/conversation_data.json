    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The amount of wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift, which is given in the problem, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, also known as the RV amplitude, $K$.\n    So, we can write the relationship:\n    $\\Delta \\lambda \\propto K$\n    Given this proportionality, the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars is equal to the ratio of their measured wavelength shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ mÅ}}{7 \\text{ mÅ}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** The RV amplitude $K$ for a star of mass $M_{star}$ orbited by a planet of mass $m_{planet}$ in a circular orbit with period $T$ can be expressed by the following formula. For a circular orbit viewed at an inclination $i$:\n    $K = v_{star} \\sin(i) = \\frac{2 \\pi a_{star}}{T} \\sin(i)$\n    where $a_{star}$ is the radius of the star's own orbit around the system's center of mass.\n\n3.  **Use Center of Mass and Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   From the definition of the center of mass, we have $M_{star} a_{star} = m_{planet} a_{planet}$. The semi-major axis of the planet's orbit is $a = a_{star} + a_{planet}$. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($m_{planet} \\ll M_{star}$), we can approximate $a_{planet} \\approx a$. This gives:\n        $a_{star} \\approx \\frac{m_{planet}}{M_{star}} a$\n    *   Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period $T$ to the semi-major axis $a$:\n        $T^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G (M_{star} + m_{planet})} a^3$\n        Again, since $m_{planet} \\ll M_{star}$, we can simplify this to:\n        $T^2 \\approx \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G M_{star}} a^3$\n        We can rearrange this to solve for $a$:\n        $a \\approx \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} T^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations to Find the Key Relationship:** Now, substitute the expressions for $a_{star}$ and $a$ into the equation for $K$:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{2 \\pi \\sin(i)}{T} \\left( \\frac{m_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} T^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    Let's simplify this expression to see how $K$ depends on $T$.\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot \\frac{m_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\cdot (M_{star} T^2)^{1/3}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\cdot (M_{star})^{1/3} \\cdot T^{2/3} \\cdot T^{-1}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{(M_{star})^{2/3}} \\cdot T^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Apply the Relationship to the Two Systems:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have exactly the same masses ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($m_{planet1} = m_{planet2}$).\n    *   Since no information on orbital inclination is given, we make the standard assumption that the viewing geometry is comparable for both systems, so we can consider $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    With these parameters being the same for both systems, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality between $K$ and $T^{-1/3}$:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** We can now write a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{T_1^{-1/3}}{T_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    We want to find $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n    Now, we substitute the known ratio of the RV amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n7.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** To find the answer, we calculate the numerical value of the fraction.\n```python\nprint((5/7)**3)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.3644321905308696\n</execute_output>\nThe result is approximately 0.3644. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects planets by observing the periodic Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) of the host star's spectral lines. This shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude ($K$), which is the maximum speed of the star's wobble along our line of sight. Therefore, we can write the ratio of the amplitudes as the ratio of the observed shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ mÅ}}{7 \\text{ mÅ}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet of mass $m_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_{star}$ in a circular orbit with period $T$, the star's RV amplitude $K$ is given by the formula (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, $m_p \\ll M_{star}$):\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Identify Constants and Variables:** The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   We can assume the orbital inclinations are statistically similar, so we can treat $\\sin i$ as a constant factor for both systems ($\\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2$).\n\n    With these parameters being the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to a relationship between the RV amplitude $K$ and the orbital period $T$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Set Up the Ratio of the Systems:** We can now express the ratio of the RV amplitudes in terms of the ratio of their orbital periods:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{T_1^{-1/3}}{T_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. We can rearrange the equation by cubing both sides:\n    $\\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Substitute the known ratio of the RV amplitudes into the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n    The numerical value is approximately 0.3644. This value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
