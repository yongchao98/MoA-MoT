    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the basic assumptions:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution of stars:** This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds). We can also write `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Count stars in a spherical shell:**\n    Let's consider the stars located at a distance between `d` and `d + dd` from us. These stars form a thin spherical shell.\n    *   The surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness `dd`: `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the number density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell: `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`.\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars to parallax:**\n    We have found the number of stars as a function of distance `d`. The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of *parallax*. So, we need to change our variable from distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`).\n\n4.  **Perform the change of variables:**\n    *   We know `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We also need to relate the interval `dd` to the interval `d(plx)`. We can find this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign just indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are counting the number of stars in an interval, we are concerned with the magnitude of the interval. So we can write `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the star count equation:**\n    Now, we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = 4πρ d² |dd|`\n    `dN = 4πρ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since `4πρ` is a constant, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is directly proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
