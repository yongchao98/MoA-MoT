    "This is a problem of special relativity. I need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n*   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is the \"stationary\" frame.\n*   The ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame, `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the proper time because it's measured in the frame that is at rest relative to the event (the clock is on the ejecta).\n*   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Determine the Goal:**\n*   Calculate the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame (frame S).\n\n**4. Reasoning and Formulas:**\n*   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame (frame S).\n*   According to the theory of special relativity, time passes differently in frames that are in relative motion. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n*   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio β = v/c.**\n    `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor, γ.**\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - β²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\nNow, I will use Python to compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the term under the square root for the Lorentz factor\none_minus_beta_squared = 1 - beta**2\n\n# Calculate the distance d = (v * delta_t0) / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\ndistance = (v * delta_t0) / math.sqrt(one_minus_beta_squared)\n\nprint(distance)\n```\nThe python code returns the value `3061862.178486916`.\n\n**6. Analysis of Results and Options:**\n*   The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n*   Let's compare this with the given options:\n    A) 3,060,000 km\n    B) 2,940,000 km\n    C) 3,000,000 km\n    D) 2,880,000 km\n*   The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option A) `3,060,000 km`. The small difference (about 0.06%) is likely due to rounding in the problem's design.\n\n*   **Alternative check:**\n    *   Option C (`3,000,000 km`) is the non-relativistic answer (`d = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 * 50`), which is incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n    *   Options B and D would require the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt = d/v`) to be less than the proper time (`Δt₀ = 50s`), which contradicts the principle of time dilation. For B, `Δt = 2,940,000/60,000 = 49s`. For D, `Δt = 2,880,000/60,000 = 48s`.\n    *   Therefore, only option A is physically plausible and numerically consistent with the calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference.\n    *   The Galaxy's frame (let's call it S), which we consider the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's frame (let's call it S'), which is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval is measured in the ejecta's frame, `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured by a clock moving with the ejecta, it is the proper time, often denoted as `Δt₀`. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:** We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (frame S).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the time measured in the ejecta's frame (S', `Δt₀`).\n    *   The relationship between these times is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   Now, calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √(0.96))`\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Final Value:**\n    *   Using the code interpreter, we found `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        *   A) 3,060,000 km\n        *   B) 2,940,000 km\n        *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect non-relativistic answer)\n        *   D) 2,880,000 km\n    *   The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
