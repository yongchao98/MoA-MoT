    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    *   **\"as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: The other substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X) and a second substituent that contains 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   The most straightforward and common chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This group has exactly 2 carbons and one carbonyl.\n    *   Let's check the total carbon count with this structure: 6 carbons (ring) + 2 carbons (acetyl group) = 8 carbons. This matches the information given.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular structure is a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n3.  **Consider the Possible Isomers and Predict their 1H NMR Spectra:**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions.\n    *   The molecule has a total of 7 protons: 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers:** In these isomers, all 4 aromatic protons would be in different chemical environments, leading to a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets), not simple doublets.\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution):** This isomer (4-haloacetophenone) has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other.\n        *   This results in a characteristic splitting pattern in the aromatic region: **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is electron-withdrawing, so it will deshield the protons ortho to it, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield).\n        *   The halogen is also electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will also be downfield. We expect the aromatic protons to be in the range of ~7.3-8.0 ppm.\n        *   The methyl protons (-CH3) are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which deshields them. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**, integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone:** Aromatic region with two doublets (2H each) and an aliphatic region with one singlet (3H).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The structure that would fit this data is 4-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO), which also has 8 carbons. However, the aromatic protons in this compound would be expected at a lower chemical shift (around 7.2-7.3 ppm) because the -CH2CHO group is less electron-withdrawing than a directly attached -COCH3 group. The high shifts (7.8, 7.6 ppm) make this option inconsistent.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data does not show the expected pattern for a disubstituted benzene ring (typically 4 protons in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This data lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring. The integration (2H + 2H = 4H) is correct for the aromatic protons.\n        *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a singlet integrating to 3H at a chemical shift of 2.3 ppm, which is perfectly characteristic of a **methyl group attached to a carbonyl** (-COCH3).\n        *   The total proton count is 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, which matches our derived structure.\n        *   This spectrum is a textbook match for a **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a 4-haloacetophenone, and the NMR data in option D perfectly matches the expected spectrum for this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
