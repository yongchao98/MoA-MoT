    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical system:** The potential is given as $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential energy for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means that the spring constant, and hence the angular frequency $\\omega$, is the same in all three spatial directions.\n\n2.  **Write down the Hamiltonian and find the energy eigenvalues:** The Hamiltonian for this system can be conveniently expressed as the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$), where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    $H = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 z^2\\right)$\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer quantum number ($n=0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\n    Since the three dimensions are independent, the total energy eigenvalue is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    We can define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels depend only on this number $N$:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, for $N = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n3.  **Determine the energy of the third excited state:**\n    *   The **ground state** is the state with the lowest energy, which corresponds to $N=0$. Its energy is $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The **first excited state** corresponds to $N=1$. Its energy is $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The **second excited state** corresponds to $N=2$. Its energy is $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $N=3$. Its energy is $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Determine the degeneracy of the third excited state:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the energy level $E_3$, we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $N=3$.\n    Let's list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    *   **Partitions of 3 into 3 parts:**\n        1.  (3, 0, 0): This can be arranged in 3 ways: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3).\n        2.  (2, 1, 0): This can be arranged in $3! = 6$ ways: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2).\n        3.  (1, 1, 1): This can be arranged in only 1 way: (1,1,1).\n\n    The total number of states is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    So, the degeneracy of the third excited state is 10.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy $g_N$ of the N-th energy level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n    $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $N=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nB) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
