    "This question requires us to compare the densities of four different exoplanets. Let's analyze each case based on the principles of planetary physics.\n\n**Key Concept: Density and Gravitational Compression**\n\nDensity (ρ) is defined as mass (M) divided by volume (V): ρ = M/V. For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n\nA crucial factor for planets with the same composition is **gravitational compression**. A more massive planet exerts a stronger gravitational force on itself. This increased gravity compresses the planet's constituent materials, packing them more tightly and thus increasing the overall average density. Therefore, for a set of planets with the same composition, the density will increase with mass.\n\nLet's apply this concept to the given options. We will use Earth's density as a reference point: ρ_Earth ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This is essentially a planet identical to Earth.\n    *   Its density is ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n    *   The density is given directly in the problem description.\n    *   Its density is ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   This planet has the same building blocks as Earth (iron core, silicate mantle, etc.).\n    *   Since it is 5 times more massive, its self-gravity will be much stronger than Earth's.\n    *   This stronger gravity will cause greater compression of its materials.\n    *   Therefore, its average density must be significantly higher than Earth's density. So, ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   (A quick calculation using mass-radius relationships for rocky planets, R ∝ M^0.27, suggests a density of around 7.5 g/cm³).\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   This planet also has the same composition as Earth.\n    *   Since it is less massive (0.5 Earth masses), its self-gravity will be weaker.\n    *   This weaker gravity leads to less compression of its materials compared to Earth.\n    *   Therefore, its average density will be lower than Earth's density. So, ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   (A quick calculation suggests a density of around 4.8 g/cm³).\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nLet's summarize the densities:\n*   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_b ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n*   ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nBy comparing these values, it is clear that planet (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
