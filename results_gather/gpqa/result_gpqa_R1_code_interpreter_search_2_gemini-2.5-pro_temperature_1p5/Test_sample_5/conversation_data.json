    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often best to work in a coordinate system where the potential separates into a sum of functions of a single variable. Let's try converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The standard relations between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Now substitute these into the potential expression:\n    *   The first term is `1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)`.\n    *   The second term involves `r^2 cos^2(θ)`. We can rewrite this as `(r cos(θ))^2`. Since `x = r cos(θ)`, this term becomes `x^2`. So, `3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ) = 3/2 kx^2`.\n\n    Now, add the two terms together to get the potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\n    Combine the terms with x^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n3.  **Recognize the System:**\n    The potential `V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2` is a sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials: `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`, where:\n    *   `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`\n    *   `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`\n\n    This means the system is a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n4.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is separable. The total energy `E` is the sum of the energies from the x and y directions, `E = E_x + E_y`. We need to find the energy eigenvalues for each one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.\n\n    The potential for a 1D harmonic oscillator is generally written as `V(q) = 1/2 k_q q^2 = 1/2 mω_q^2 q^2`. The energy eigenvalues are given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω_q`, where `n` is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`. Comparing this to `1/2 k_x x^2`, we get the effective spring constant `k_x = 4k`.\n        The angular frequency is `ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)`.\n        The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are `E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m)`.\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`. The effective spring constant is `k_y = k`.\n        The angular frequency is `ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)`.\n        The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are `E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy `E` is the sum of `E_{n_x}` and `E_{n_y}`:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    Now, factor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k / m)`:\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    Distribute the 2 inside the bracket:\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    Combine the constant terms:\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is `E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`.\n    Let's look at the given options:\n    A) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    B) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    Our result matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
