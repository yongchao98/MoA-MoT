    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants and the type of functional group.**\n    *   The first reactant is **4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol**. The suffix \"-enol\" indicates the presence of both a double bond (\"-en-\") and a hydroxyl group (\"-ol\") attached to one of the carbons of the double bond. Specifically, it's a cyclopentene ring. The numbering starts from the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (C1), and the double bond is between C1 and C2. There are two methyl groups at the C4 position.\n    *   The second reactant is **bromine (Br₂)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Recognize the reactivity of the enol functional group.**\n    *   Enols are tautomers of ketones or aldehydes. They exist in equilibrium with their corresponding keto form. The keto tautomer of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol is **4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n    *   The C=C double bond in an enol is electron-rich and nucleophilic, particularly at the carbon not attached to the oxygen (the α-carbon, which is C2 in this case).\n    *   Enols react with electrophiles like halogens (Br₂). This reaction is known as α-halogenation because the halogen ends up on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group in the final product.\n\n*   **Step 3: Predict the reaction mechanism and the resulting product.**\n    1.  **Nucleophilic attack:** The π electrons of the enol's C=C double bond attack one of the bromine atoms in the Br₂ molecule. This attack occurs at C2, which is the nucleophilic center. A new C-Br bond is formed at C2.\n    2.  **Formation of an intermediate:** The other bromine atom leaves as a bromide ion (Br⁻). This step results in an oxonium ion intermediate, where the oxygen atom has a positive charge and is double-bonded to C1 (this is a resonance form; the more stable representation has a C=O⁺H bond).\n    3.  **Deprotonation and tautomerization:** A weak base (like the Br⁻ formed in the previous step, or a solvent molecule) removes the proton from the hydroxyl group. The electrons from the O-H bond move to form a C=O double bond.\n    4.  **Final Product:** This process regenerates the stable carbonyl group, resulting in a ketone that is halogenated at the alpha-position.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the structure and name of the final product.**\n    *   The starting ketone skeleton is 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n    *   The bromination occurs at the alpha-carbon involved in the enol double bond, which is C2.\n    *   Therefore, the major product is **2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n    *   A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Incorrect. Bromination occurs at the α-position (C2 or C5), not at C4.\n    *   B) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: Incorrect. This is an addition product, not the substitution product formed from an enol reaction. The enol functionality is lost to reform the more stable keto group.\n    *   C) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Correct. This matches our predicted product from the α-halogenation of the enol.\n    *   D) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: Incorrect, for the same reasons as B.\n\n<<<C>>>"
