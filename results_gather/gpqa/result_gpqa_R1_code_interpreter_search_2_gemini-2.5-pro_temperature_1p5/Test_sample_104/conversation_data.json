    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem compares two scenarios that can produce a periodic dip in the light observed from a star:\n*   **Scenario 1: Starspots.** A star has one hemisphere covered in dark, cooler spots. As the star rotates, this spotty hemisphere faces the observer, causing the star's total brightness to decrease. When the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, the brightness is at its maximum. The difference between the maximum and minimum brightness is the amplitude of the signal due to rotational modulation.\n*   **Scenario 2: Exoplanet Transit.** A hypothetical, non-spotted star is orbited by an exoplanet. When the planet passes in front of the star (a transit), it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The magnitude of this dip is the amplitude of the transit signal.\n\nThe goal is to find the size of an exoplanet (relative to its star) that would produce the same amplitude as the starspots.\n\n**2. Model the Flux from the Spotted Star**\n\nWe use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux (energy per unit area per unit time) emitted by a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (F ∝ T⁴). The total light received from the star (its brightness) is proportional to the sum of fluxes from all parts of its visible disk.\n\n*   **T_eff:** Effective temperature of the star's unspotted surface = 6000 K.\n*   **T_spot:** Temperature of the spots. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K and are dark, so T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n*   **f:** The filling factor of the spots on the spotty hemisphere = 20% = 0.20. In a simplified model, this is the fraction of the visible disk covered by spots when the spotty hemisphere is facing the observer.\n\nLet's calculate the flux at maximum and minimum brightness:\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature T_eff. So, F_max is proportional to T_eff⁴.\n    `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere faces the observer. The visible disk is a composite: a fraction `(1 - f)` of the area has temperature T_eff, and a fraction `f` has temperature T_spot. The total flux is a weighted average.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\n**3. Calculate the Amplitude of the Starspot Signal**\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux, calculated as the drop from maximum brightness.\nAmplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude_spot = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\nAmplitude_spot = 1 - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude_spot = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\nAmplitude_spot = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\nAmplitude_spot = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n**4. Model the Amplitude of the Exoplanet Transit Signal**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light proportional to its area relative to the star's projected area (disk).\n*   **R_pl:** Radius of the planet.\n*   **R_star:** Radius of the star.\n\nThe area of the planet's silhouette is π * R_pl². The area of the star's disk is π * R_star².\nThe amplitude of the transit signal (also known as the transit depth) is the ratio of these areas.\nAmplitude_transit = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\nAmplitude_transit = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**5. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nThe problem asks for the planet size that produces the *same amplitude signal*. Therefore, we set the two amplitudes equal to each other.\nAmplitude_transit = Amplitude_spot\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative radius, R_pl / R_star:\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] )\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\n\nLet's substitute the given values into the equation.\n*   f = 0.20\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 5000 K\n\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴] )\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴] )\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script for the final calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star properties\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature in K\nT_spot = 5000.0 # Spot temperature in K\nf = 0.20        # Spot filling factor\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\namplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of a transit signal is (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n# We set the two amplitudes equal and solve for R_pl / R_star.\nr_pl_r_star = math.sqrt(amplitude_spot)\n\nprint(f\"{r_pl_r_star:.4f}\")\n```\n```output\n0.3218\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3218.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative radius R_pl / R_star is ~0.32. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
