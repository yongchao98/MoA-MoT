    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charges and Conductor:** We start with an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. A positive charge `+q` is placed inside a cavity within this conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. This creates an induced negative charge on the inner surface. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field `E` inside the conductor's material must be zero.\n    According to Gauss's Law: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on our Gaussian surface, the total enclosed charge $Q_{enclosed}$ must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed in the cavity and the induced charge on the inner surface, $q_{inner}$.\n    So, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $q_{inner} = -q$.\n    A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor as a whole was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface (by moving electrons from other parts of the conductor), a net charge of `+q` must be left behind somewhere else on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. In a conductor, excess charge resides on its surface(s). Therefore, a charge of `+q` will appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges inside it. In our case, the conductor itself acts as this shield. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced only by the charges on the outer surface. The internal charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall are arranged in such a way that their combined electric field is exactly zero for all points outside the cavity.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor, which is a sphere of radius R. Since there are no other external electric fields mentioned in the problem, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to be in the lowest energy state (maximum separation).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion on Extra Information:** The information about the cavity's radius (`r`), its position (`s`), the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta` is all irrelevant to finding the electric field *outside* the conductor. This information would be necessary if one were to calculate the field *inside* the cavity, but for the exterior field, the shielding effect simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n8.  **Comparing with Options:** The derived expression for the electric field is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
