    "The user wants me to identify a pair of aromatic compounds from a given list that, in a 1:1 mixture, would produce a specific 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Provided Spectral Data\n\n- **Sample:** A 1:1 molar mixture of two aromatic compounds.\n- **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14.\n- **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n- **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds\n\nFirst, let's verify that all candidate compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n- Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14. Correct.\n- Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14. Correct.\n\nNext, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the carbons at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at position 2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at position 5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH2) protons will be a **quartet** (split by CH3) and the methyl (CH3) protons will be a **triplet** (split by CH2).\n    *   The problem states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Mixtures in Each Option\n\nNow, let's analyze the spectrum that would result from a 1:1 mixture of the compounds in each option.\n\n**A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene produces a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (2H singlet) + Isodurene (2H singlet). This gives two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H). This would result in up to five signals, not the three signals described. It cannot be combined to produce a 2:1:1 ratio. This contradicts the data.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Durene (2H singlet) + Prehnitene (2H singlet). This gives two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Aliphatic:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Prehnitene (two 6H singlets). Assuming the chemical shifts are different, this mixture would produce exactly three singlets. The integrations would be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This perfectly matches the data.**\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Durene (2H singlet) + Isodurene (2H singlet). This gives two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H). This combination would result in four signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, 3H, and 3H (ratio 4:2:1:1). This contradicts the data.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
