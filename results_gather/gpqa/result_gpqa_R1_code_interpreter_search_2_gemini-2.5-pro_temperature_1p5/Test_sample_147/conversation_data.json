    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y.**\n    *   We are given that substance A2 has a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, F is fluorine, n is the number of fluorine atoms, M_Y is the molar mass of Y, and M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (19.00 g/mol).\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction is: ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F).\n    *   Substituting the given values: 0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00).\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for M_Y: M_Y = (19.00n / 0.3196) - 19.00n = 19.00n * (1/0.3196 - 1) ≈ 40.45n.\n    *   We need to find a plausible element Y by testing integer values for n. The element Y is known to form five binary compounds with fluorine. This points towards elements that can exhibit multiple oxidation states, such as p-block nonmetals or certain transition metals.\n    *   Let's test values of n:\n        *   n = 1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca). Unlikely to form five fluorides.\n        *   n = 2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se). Plausible.\n        *   n = 3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (e.g., Sb). Plausible.\n        *   n = 4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (e.g., Dy). Unlikely.\n        *   n = 5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (e.g., Hg). Unlikely.\n        *   n = 6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Am). Unlikely.\n    *   The statement that A1 (a fluoride of Y) \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\" is a very strong clue. Only a few substances are powerful enough to do this. The fluorides of platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), and krypton (Kr) are known for this reactivity.\n    *   Let's test these possibilities against our calculated M_Y.\n        *   If Y = Kr (M_Y = 83.8 g/mol), for n=2, our formula gives M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is a very close match.\n        *   If Y = Pt (M_Y = 195.08 g/mol), no integer n gives a close match.\n        *   If Y = Ru (M_Y = 101.07 g/mol), for n=2.5 (not an integer, so not a simple binary compound), M_Y would be ~101.1 g/mol.\n    *   Krypton (Kr) is the most likely candidate for Y. Krypton forms several binary fluorides: KrF2, KrF4, and potentially others under specific conditions. While \"five\" might be a slight exaggeration or include unstable/matrix-isolated species, the chemical properties strongly point towards Kr.\n\n2.  **Identify the Compounds A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5.**\n    *   Let's assume Y = Kr.\n    *   A2 has the formula YF_n. Since we found n=2 gives the best fit for the molar mass, A2 is **KrF2**.\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine (F2). This implies A1 has a higher fluorine content than A2. The next known fluoride is **KrF4**. The decomposition reaction is: KrF4 → KrF2 + F2. KrF4 is known to be unstable, decomposing above -30 °C (243 K), which fits the description of decomposing at 293 K (20 °C). The description \"bright-red\" may be an inaccuracy, as it's typically described as a volatile white solid, but chemical properties are a stronger indicator than color in such problems. A1's ability to oxidize xenon is consistent with it being a powerful fluorinating agent like KrF4.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Kr) with fluorine and can also interact with xenon. This is the synthesis of **KrF2** or **KrF4** from the elements. Kr + F2 → KrF2. As KrF4 (A1) also fits this description, A3 is likely KrF2. The interaction with xenon could be a ligand exchange or further oxidation under specific conditions. Let's tentatively assign A3 as KrF2.\n    *   Now, let's identify A4 and A5. A5 is obtained by adding Y (Kr) to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. A4 is another binary compound of fluorine and Y (Krypton). The most stable and common fluoride of krypton is KrF2 (A2). It's plausible that the other fluorides mentioned are Lewis acid-base adducts with KrF2. For example, KrF2 can react with strong Lewis acids like AsF5 and SbF5.\n    *   A strong candidate for A4 is a Lewis acid that can form an adduct with KrF2. The elements near Krypton that form strong fluoride Lewis acids are in Group 15, namely Arsenic (As) and Antimony (Sb).\n    *   Let's consider the reaction: `A4 + Kr -> A5` (1:1 molar ratio). If A4 is a krypton-fluorine compound, this reaction is unclear. It is more likely that the problem description meant \"A5 is obtained by adding **A2** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio\". This is a common pattern in inorganic chemistry problems where a simple fluoride (like A2 = KrF2) is reacted with a Lewis acid (A4). Let's proceed with this more plausible interpretation.\n    *   Reaction: A4 + A2 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio). `A4 + KrF2 -> A5`. This is a classic Lewis acid-base reaction. A4 must be a strong Lewis acid fluoride. Let's assume **A4 = AsF5** or **A4 = SbF5**.\n    *   Let's test **A4 = AsF5**. Molar mass = 74.92 (As) + 5 * 19.00 (F) = 74.92 + 95.00 = **169.92 g/mol**.\n    *   The reaction would be: AsF5 + KrF2 → [KrF]+[AsF6]-. So, **A5 = [KrF]+[AsF6]-**.\n    *   The problem states A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. The salt [KrF]+[AsF6]- is known to be unstable in water and decomposes, for example, to Kr, O2, HF, and H3AsO4. This fits the description.\n    *   Let's test **A4 = SbF5**. Molar mass = 121.76 (Sb) + 5 * 19.00 (F) = 121.76 + 95.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n    *   The reaction would be: SbF5 + KrF2 → [KrF]+[SbF6]-. So, **A5 = [KrF]+[SbF6]-**. This also decomposes in water.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Weight Range for A4.**\n    *   We have identified two strong candidates for A4: AsF5 and SbF5.\n    *   Molecular weight of AsF5 = 169.92 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF5 = 216.76 g/mol.\n    *   Let's re-examine the reaction: `By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.` If we take this literally, it means `A4 + Kr -> A5`. This is chemically less plausible than `A4 + KrF2 -> A5`. However, some high-oxidation-state fluorides (like RuF6 or PtF6) can react directly with noble gases. If A4 were such a compound, its molar mass would be much higher (RuF6 ≈ 215 g/mol, PtF6 ≈ 309 g/mol).\n    *   Given the common patterns in such chemistry problems, the interpretation of the reaction being between the simple fluoride (A2) and a Lewis acid (A4) is the most probable one. The wording might be slightly imprecise.\n    *   If we assume A4 is AsF5, its molecular weight is 169.92 g/mol. This falls squarely in the range of 160-180.\n    *   If we assume A4 is SbF5, its molecular weight is 216.76 g/mol. This does not fit any of the provided ranges well.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    *   The most logical identification for element Y is Krypton (Kr).\n    *   A2 is KrF2.\n    *   The reaction to form A5 is most likely `A4 + KrF2 -> A5`.\n    *   A4 is a strong Lewis acid fluoride, with AsF5 being the most suitable candidate.\n    *   The molecular weight of AsF5 is approximately 170 g/mol.\n    *   This molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>"
