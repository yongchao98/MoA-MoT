    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molar mass of the molecule with the most common isotopes. Since this is the base peak (100% relative abundance), we can assume the molar mass is 156 g/mol.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which simplifies to approximately 3:1.\n    *   This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom, because the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl. The molecule with ³⁵Cl has a mass of 156, and the molecule with ³⁷Cl has a mass of 158.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this extreme broadening.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons and integrates to one proton ('1H').\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n        *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent to each other. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets. The downfield chemical shifts (7.72 and 8.02 ppm) indicate that both substituents on the ring are electron-withdrawing.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Has no carboxylic acid. Inconsistent with IR and NMR.\n    *   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would show an aldehyde proton (~10 ppm) but not a carboxylic acid proton (~11-12 ppm). The aromatic substitution pattern would also be different (3 protons, not 4, and a different splitting pattern). Inconsistent with IR and NMR.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. This would lead to four distinct aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not the simple two doublets observed.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n        *   **MS:** Has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂, Molar mass = 156.57 g/mol. Contains one chlorine atom. This matches the MS data.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. This matches the IR data.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which explains the 11.0 ppm signal. It is *para*-substituted with two electron-withdrawing groups (-COOH and -Cl), which perfectly explains the NMR pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. The protons ortho to the stronger electron-withdrawing group (-COOH) would be further downfield (8.02 ppm), and the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be slightly more shielded (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:** All provided spectral data are fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
