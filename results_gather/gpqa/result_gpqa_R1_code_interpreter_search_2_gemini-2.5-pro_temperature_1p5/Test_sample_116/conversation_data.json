    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n**Analysis of each compound:**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound where two benzene rings are linked by a single C-C bond. All four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' relative to the bond connecting the rings) are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The presence of large substituents at all four ortho positions severely restricts the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called hindered rotation. Because of this, the two rings cannot lie in the same plane (they are not coplanar). The molecule adopts a twisted, stable conformation. This twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. A molecule that is non-planar and lacks these symmetry elements is chiral. This specific type of chirality arising from restricted rotation is known as **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is chiral, it exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This compound is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   An atom bonded to four distinct groups is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, it is a chiral molecule and shows optical isomerism. It can exist as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** Also known as diphenyl ketone, its structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. A central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. While the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
