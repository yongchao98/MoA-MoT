    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key indicator.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ for the dimeric form).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n*   **Key splitting patterns:**\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThis is the crucial information for identifying the structure. Let's break down what these splitting patterns mean. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (the n+1 rule).\n*   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** This means a proton (let's call it H_A) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), causing a quartet (3+1=4).\n    For this pattern to be observed, H_A must be a **methine (CH)** group with its carbon atom bonded to three other carbons that carry 1, 2, and 3 protons, respectively (i.e., a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group).\n\n*   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** This means a proton (let's call it H_B) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing another triplet (2+1=3).\n    For this pattern to be observed, H_B must be a **methine (CH)** group with its carbon atom bonded to three other carbons that carry 1, 2, and 2 protons, respectively (i.e., a CH and two different CH₂ groups).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nThe condensed formulas are written in a potentially confusing way. Let's parse them into their IUPAC names and structures, assuming they represent a linear backbone from left to right, with bracketed groups as substituents.\n\n#### **Candidate A: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\nLet's assume `C(H)` is a way of writing `CH`.\nStructure: `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`.\nNumbering from the COOH group (C1): `COOH(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(C2H5)-CH(4)(C2H5)-CH3(5)`.\nThis is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's analyze its key protons:\n*   **Proton on C4 (H₄):** This is a methine (CH) proton. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The proton on C3 (a CH group, **1H**).\n    *   The protons on C5 (a CH₃ group, **3H**).\n    *   The protons on the ethyl group's CH₂ (a CH₂ group, **2H**).\n    This proton is coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the data.\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H₃):** This is a methine (CH) proton. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The proton on C4 (a CH group, **1H**).\n    *   The protons on C2 (a CH₂ group, **2H**).\n    *   The protons on the ethyl group's CH₂ (another CH₂ group, **2H**).\n    This proton is coupled to 1H, 2H, and another 2H. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This also matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This structure is the only one that exhibits both the `dtq` and `dtt` splitting patterns required by the ¹H NMR data.\n\n#### **Candidate B: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\nStructure: `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`\nIUPAC Name: **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   Proton on C3 (H₃): Neighbors are H(C2), H₂(C4), and H₂(Et). This gives a **dtt**.\n*   Is there a `dtq`? No. There is no methine proton coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group simultaneously. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n#### **Candidate C: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\nStructure: `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\nIUPAC Name: **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   Proton on C3 (H₃): Neighbors are H(C2), H₂(C4), and H₃(Me). This gives a **dtq**.\n*   Is there a `dtt`? No. There is no methine proton coupled to a CH and two different CH₂ groups. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n#### **Candidate D: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\nStructure: `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\nIUPAC Name: **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   Proton on C3 (H₃): Neighbors are H₂(C2), H(C4), and H₃(Me). This gives a **dtq**.\n*   Is there a `dtt`? No. The other methine proton (H₄) is coupled to H(C3), and two different CH₃ groups, not two CH₂ groups. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option A, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, has the specific proton environments that would generate both a `doublet of triplets of quartets` and a `doublet of triplets of triplets` in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
