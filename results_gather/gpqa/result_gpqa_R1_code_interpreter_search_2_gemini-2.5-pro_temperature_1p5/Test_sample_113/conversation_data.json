    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   The reaction is: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n    *   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   The mechanism is as follows:\n        1.  The nucleophilic CN⁻ attacks the carbonyl carbon, breaking the C=O double bond and forming an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        2.  This alkoxide intermediate needs a proton (H⁺) to form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Therefore, reagent 'A' must be a source of protons, i.e., an acid.\n    *   Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution and is a suitable proton source. The reaction is typically performed by adding acid after the initial nucleophilic attack, or by generating HCN in situ from NaCN and an acid. H₃O⁺ is the general representation for this acidic condition/reagent.\n        *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) forms a different type of adduct with ketones (a crystalline bisulfite addition product) and is not used to form cyanohydrins.\n    *   So, A must be H₃O⁺. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   The reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be carried out under either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, followed by appropriate workup. The reaction requires heating.\n    *   The prompt shows the reaction is carried out with reagent 'B' in the presence of water (H₂O).\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options for B (from options B and C):\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it can protonate species, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid. This reaction typically requires a strong mineral acid.\n        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. Aqueous HCl (or H₂SO₄) is the standard reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The process involves protonation of the nitrile nitrogen, followed by nucleophilic attack by water, leading to an amide intermediate, which is further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, B is most suitably HCl.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these, we get A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
