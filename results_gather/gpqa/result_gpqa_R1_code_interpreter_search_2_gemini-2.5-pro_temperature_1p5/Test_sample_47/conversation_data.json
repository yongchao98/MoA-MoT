    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring containing a ketone functional group.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate, which attacks the bromine molecule. The result is the substitution of one of the α-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** With an α-halo ketone and a strong base, the most characteristic reaction is the Favorskii rearrangement. The hydroxide ion removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate. This enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, where the enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate. The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained bicyclic ketone, leading to the opening of the three-membered ring. The more stable carbanion is formed, which results in the contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring. After protonation during workup, the final product is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   An alternative reaction, E2 elimination, to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is less likely to be the intended path because this product would not react with the reagents in the next step.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). The hydroxyl (-OH) group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild and selective reducing agent. Unlike the much more reactive LiAlH₄, the bulky tert-butoxy groups on LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ make it less reactive. It is particularly useful for the partial reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage and does not proceed to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. In NMR spectroscopy, chemically non-equivalent hydrogens give rise to distinct signals.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached. Let's analyze its symmetry and hydrogen environments.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and H), the carbon atom it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n2.  **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   The carbon C2 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n    *   The carbon C3 is chemically equivalent to C4.\n3.  **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen attached to the carbonyl carbon (-C**H**O) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type of hydrogen.\n    *   **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also in a unique environment. This is a **2nd** distinct type of hydrogen.\n    *   **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** Carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic because C1 is a chiral center. This means they are chemically non-equivalent. Let's call them H2a and H2b. By symmetry, the hydrogens on C5 are equivalent to those on C2 (i.e., H5a is equivalent to H2a, and H5b is equivalent to H2b). Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 give rise to **2** distinct signals.\n    *   **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Carbons C3 and C4 are also equivalent. Similar to C2, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic. Their chemical environments are different relative to the chiral center at C1. By symmetry, the hydrogens on C4 are equivalent to those on C3. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C3 and C4 also give rise to **2** distinct signals.\n\n**Total Count:**\nAdding up the distinct types of hydrogens:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5-H's) + 2 (from C3/C4-H's) = **6**\n\nThus, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
