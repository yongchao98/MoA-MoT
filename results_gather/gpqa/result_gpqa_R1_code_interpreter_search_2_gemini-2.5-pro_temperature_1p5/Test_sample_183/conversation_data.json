    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   **C1: ethoxy group (-OEt)**. This is a strongly activating, *ortho, para* director.\n*   **C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)**. This is an activating, *ortho, para* director. It is very bulky.\n*   **C3: nitro group (-NO2)**. This is a strongly deactivating, *meta* director.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   All three substituents are adjacent (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n*   The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the deactivating group (-NO2). This is unusual for a direct electrophilic aromatic substitution and is a major clue. It suggests the activating group was not present in its final form during the nitration step, or its directing effect was overridden.\n*   The -tBu and -NO2 groups are ortho to each other.\n*   The -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nWe need to find a sequence of reactions that correctly installs these groups in the specified arrangement with high yield. We will consider the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. Due to its large size, the *para* product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is the major product. The required *ortho* isomer is the minor product, so this step has a low yield for the necessary intermediate.\niii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization. This step requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. However, the product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. Therefore, this reaction sequence is chemically incorrect as written. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The lone pair on the nitrogen of the amino group coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms an anilinium-like complex (-NH2-AlCl3), which is strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director. Thus, alkylation would yield primarily *meta*-tert-butylaniline, not the *ortho* or *para* isomers needed to build towards the target. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para position is blocked).\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group → diazonium salt.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. Diazonium groups are extremely strong deactivators and meta-directors. Performing a nitration under these harsh conditions is not a standard or viable synthetic step and would likely lead to decomposition. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence is the most synthetically plausible, so let's analyze it in detail.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As noted before, this gives mainly the para-isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**, which we will assume is carried forward as the high-yield pathway.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group → **4-tert-butylaniline**.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The amine must be protected to prevent oxidation and to control regioselectivity. Typically, it is converted to an acetamide (-NHCOCH3). The acetamido group is a strong *o,p*-director. Since the *para* position is blocked by the -tBu group, nitration occurs *ortho* to the acetamido group. Product after hydrolysis is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. (An alternative pathway without protection involves forming the anilinium ion, -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both direct nitration to the position meta to the anilinium and ortho to the tBu, leading to **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. So the outcome is the same).\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amine (4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline) → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\nviii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step (vii). The strong directing groups (-OEt, -tBu) would direct sulfonation to the C6 position.\nix) `dilute H2SO4`: Desulfonation. This step removes the sulfonic acid group just added.\n\n**Conclusion on Option D:**\nSteps (i) through (vii) constitute a coherent, high-yield synthetic pathway using standard reactions. The final two steps (viii and ix) appear redundant as they add and then remove a sulfonic acid group. The main issue is that the product synthesized, 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (a 1,2,4-substituted isomer), is an isomer of the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (a 1,2,3-substituted isomer).\n\nHowever, comparing the four options, Options A, B, and C contain steps that are fundamentally flawed or non-viable. Option D, while leading to an isomer of the named product (likely due to an error in the question's premise), consists of a sequence of chemically sound and logical reactions. In the context of a multiple-choice question, Option D is the \"best\" answer because it represents a valid synthetic strategy, whereas the others do not.\n\n<<<D>>>"
