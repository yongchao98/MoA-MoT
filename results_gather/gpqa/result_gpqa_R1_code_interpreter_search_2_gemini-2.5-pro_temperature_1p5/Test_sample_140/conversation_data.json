    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This set of reactants and conditions points to an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the substrate and the reaction.**\n*   Substrate: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where C1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br) and the adjacent carbon, C2, is attached to a deuterium atom (D). All other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   Reagent: NaNH2 in NH3. Sodium amide is a very strong base. The amide ion (NH2-) is the active species.\n*   Reaction type: Elimination-Addition via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination).**\nThe strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n1.  **C2**, which bears a deuterium (D).\n2.  **C6**, which bears a hydrogen (H).\n\nThe base can abstract from either position, leading to two different pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6.**\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of a proton (H+) from C6 is significantly faster than the abstraction of a deuteron (D+) from C2. This is therefore the major reaction pathway.\n    1.  NH2- removes H+ from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    3.  This results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2.**\n    Although slower, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is still a possible reaction.\n    1.  NH2- removes D+ from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The original deuterium atom is removed from the molecule during this process. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition).**\nThe amide ion (NH2-), acting as a nucleophile, attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation (by the solvent, NH3) of the resulting carbanion to yield the final aniline product(s).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The NH2- nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6. These two carbons are not equivalent.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** This forms a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion gives **2-deuterioaniline** (or o-deuterioaniline).\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** This forms a carbanion at C1. Protonation of this carbanion gives **3-deuterioaniline** (or m-deuterioaniline).\n    Since both modes of attack are possible, Pathway A leads to **two** different organic products.\n\n*   **Attack on benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2. The intermediate is symmetrical.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 (or C2):** The attack of NH2- at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2). The deuterium is not present in this product because it was removed in the first step of this pathway.\n    Pathway B leads to **one** organic product.\n\n**Step 4: Count the total number of unique organic products.**\nCombining the products from both possible pathways:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nThese three molecules (aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline) are structurally distinct compounds. Therefore, there are a total of three possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
