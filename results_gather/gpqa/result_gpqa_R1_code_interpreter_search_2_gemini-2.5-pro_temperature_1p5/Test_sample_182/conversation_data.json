    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Understand the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula and initial IHD.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4. A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation. The double bond adds another.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group is at position 1. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n*   **formyl group (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group is at position 2. It also contains a C=O double bond, adding another degree of unsaturation.\n*   **vinyl group (-CH=CH2)**: This group is at position 5. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula of the reactant:\n*   The basic cyclohexene ring (C6H10) has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 5, so we need to remove hydrogens from those positions to add the groups. Let's build the molecule systematically.\n*   Number of Carbon atoms (C):\n    *   6 in the cyclohexene ring\n    *   1 in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH)\n    *   1 in the formyl group (-CHO)\n    *   2 in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2)\n    *   Total C = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10\n*   Number of Hydrogen atoms (H):\n    *   The unsubstituted cyclohex-3-ene ring would be C6H10. Let's count the hydrogens on the substituted ring:\n        *   C1: bonded to -COOH, C2, and C6 -> 1 H\n        *   C2: bonded to -CHO, C1, and C3 -> 1 H\n        *   C3: part of C=C, bonded to C2 and C4 -> 1 H\n        *   C4: part of C=C, bonded to C3 and C5 -> 1 H\n        *   C5: bonded to -vinyl, C4, and C6 -> 1 H\n        *   C6: bonded to C1 and C5 -> 2 H\n    *   Total H on the ring = 1+1+1+1+1+2 = 7 H.\n    *   Hydrogens in the substituents:\n        *   -COOH: 1 H\n        *   -CHO: 1 H\n        *   -CH=CH2: 3 H\n    *   Total H = 7 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (aldehyde) + 3 (vinyl) = 12 H.\n*   Number of Oxygen atoms (O):\n    *   2 in the carboxylic acid group\n    *   1 in the formyl group\n    *   Total O = 2 + 1 = 3 O.\n*   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the IHD of the reactant to verify. The formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where X is halogens and N is nitrogen. Oxygen does not affect the calculation.\nIHD_reactant = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThis matches our structural analysis: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) = 5.\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is red phosphorus (Red P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturation in the carbon skeleton.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **All Carbon-Carbon double bonds (C=C)** are reduced to single bonds (C-C) via hydrogenation.\n*   **All Carbon-Oxygen double bonds (C=O)** are reduced.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P/HI to the reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at C1 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group at C2 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at C5 becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane. Let's find its molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon atoms:** The number of carbon atoms does not change during this reduction. So, the product still has **10 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Structure:** The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for such a compound (one ring, no other unsaturation) is **CnH2n**.\n*   Since n=10, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nWe can calculate the IHD for the product in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the molecular formula (C10H20)**\n    IHD_product = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the structure of the product**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds.\n    *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of π bonds = 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n    *   IHD_product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 1\nC) 3\nD) 0\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
