    "This problem asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-, in a buffer solution. The solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water. This creates a buffer system consisting of the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\nThe dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) occurs in three steps:\n1.  H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4-      (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n2.  H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-    (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n3.  HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-    (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\nThe solution contains a mixture of H2PO4- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base). Therefore, the pH of the solution is controlled by the second equilibrium (Ka2). The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third equilibrium (Ka3).\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\nFirst, we calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O, and then their concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n*   Concentration of H2PO4- ([H2PO4-]) = Moles / Volume (L)\n\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n*   Concentration of HPO4^2- ([HPO4^2-]) = Moles / Volume (L)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].**\nThe [H+] is determined by the buffer system H2PO4- / HPO4^2-. We can use the equilibrium expression for the second dissociation:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\nRearranging this equation to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\nWe can use the initial concentrations calculated in Step 1, as the dissociation/association is minimal in a buffer.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\nThe concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium:\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\nRearranging this equation to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\nWe use the [H+] calculated in Step 2 and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] from Step 1.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # Convert cm3 to L\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate molar concentrations of buffer components ---\n# Moles of H2PO4- from KH2PO4\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\n# Concentration of H2PO4-\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\n# Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4●2H2O\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n# Concentration of HPO4^2-\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] ---\n# Using the second dissociation equilibrium: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] ---\n# Using the third dissociation equilibrium: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3_minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3_minus:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.236e-07\n\n<<<The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is 6.236 x 10^-7 M.

Understand the Chemical System**\nThe solution is made by dissolving KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n*   KH2PO4 provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H2PO4-, which acts as a weak acid in this context.\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO4^2-, which is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\nThese two species form a buffer solution.
