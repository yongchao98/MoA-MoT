    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The observation of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with a combined integral of 1H, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two environments must belong to two different, but very similar, molecular species. The roughly equal integrals suggest these two species are present in a nearly 1:1 ratio. These species are isomers. The question is, what kind of isomers?\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates compounds based on their physical properties (e.g., polarity). The presence of two peaks of equal intensity demonstrates that there are two distinct, separable compounds in a 1:1 ratio. The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both peaks have the same mass, confirming that the two compounds are isomers of each other (they have the same molecular formula).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** \"Double coupling\" is a procedural term in synthesis referring to performing a reaction step twice to maximize yield. It does not produce a stable mixture of isomers of the final product. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Crucially, they have different physical and chemical properties. This means they will have different NMR spectra and can be separated by standard chromatography techniques (like LC). Since they are isomers, they have the same mass. This explanation fits all the observations perfectly: two species in a ~1:1 ratio (leading to equal integrals/intensities), separable by LC, giving different NMR signals, but having the same mass. In peptide synthesis, diastereomers can arise from racemization of an amino acid's alpha-carbon during a coupling step, or from cis-trans isomerism around an amide bond (particularly an X-Proline bond), which is a common phenomenon.\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (a starting material or intermediate) would almost certainly have a different molecular weight from the final product. The MS data, which shows both species have the same mass as the expected product, rules this out.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral environment (like a typical NMR solvent or a standard LC column), enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce a single peak in a standard 1H NMR spectrum and co-elute as a single peak on a standard LC column. To see two separate signals, a chiral resolving agent (for NMR) or a chiral stationary phase (for LC) would be required. Since the problem describes standard analysis techniques, this option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only explanation that accounts for two distinct species being resolved by both NMR and LC, while having the same mass, is that they are diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
