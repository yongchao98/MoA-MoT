    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure and Stereochemistry**\n\nThe product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of lactone (a cyclic ester). Let's break down its structure:\n*   **-pyran-**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom in the ring is position 1.\n*   **4-ethyl-**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n(6)C----C(5)\n |      |\n |    C(4)-CH2CH3\n |      |\n(2)C=O--C(3)\n```\n\nThis six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed by the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The linear precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**:\n\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n\nDuring cyclization, the -OH group from C5 attacks the carboxylic acid carbon (C1). The carbon that was C3 in the acid chain (the one with the ethyl group and the chiral center) becomes C4 in the lactone. The reaction (lactonization) does not affect the stereochemistry of this chiral center.\n\nTherefore:\n*   To produce **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(R)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   To produce **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(S)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe starting materials given in the options are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's draw its structure. This is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one carboxylic acid group is a free acid and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\n(where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2)\n\nThe molecule has two carbonyl-containing functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOR). The chiral center is at C3, the same carbon that becomes the chiral center in the product.\n\n**3. Determine the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe key to this problem is understanding how the two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, react with a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) while leaving the carboxylic acid (-COOH) intact.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) while leaving the ester (-COOiBu) intact.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1 (Starting material A with LiBH4)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 will reduce the ester end of the starting material.\n    `A [HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu] ---(1) LiBH4---> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n*   The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The acidic workup (H+) causes this intermediate to cyclize to the lactone product.\n*   Since the final product is the **(R)**-lactone, the intermediate must be the **(R)**-hydroxy acid. As the reaction doesn't change the stereocenter, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2 (Starting material B with BH3)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid end of the starting material.\n    `B [HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu] ---(1) BH3---> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`\n*   The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   The acidic workup (H+) then causes an intramolecular transesterification (the -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl), displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the lactone product.\n*   Since the final product is the **(S)**-lactone, the intermediate must have the **(S)** configuration. As the reaction doesn't change the stereocenter, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
