    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH(OCH₃)CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Let's number the carbon chain to identify the positions: C6-C5(OCH₃)-C4-C3(=O)-C2-C1.\n    *   There is a pre-existing chiral center at C5 with the (S) configuration.\n    *   The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center, meaning its reduction will create a new chiral center.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the intermediate alkoxide to form the final alcohol product.\n*   **Product(s):** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter at C5, the two possible products will have configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not enantiomers are called **diastereomers**. Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃C(=O)CH₂C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). NaBH₄ reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced. The acidic workup provides the protons for the final alcohol groups.\n*   **Product(s):** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** For a molecule with two chiral centers (n=2), the maximum number of stereoisomers is 2ⁿ = 4. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses achiral reagents, this pair will be formed as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Let's examine the (2R, 4S) structure. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH₂ group. A molecule with chiral centers and a plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. It is achiral. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Summary of Products from Reaction II:** Reaction II produces three stereoisomers:\n    *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of Product 3)\n    *   Product 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of Products 3 and 4)\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   It **separates** constitutional isomers (different connectivity).\n    *   It **separates** diastereomers (different physical properties, including polarity).\n    *   It **does NOT separate** enantiomers (identical physical properties in an achiral environment).\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** The final mixture contains five compounds in total before separation. Let's see how they behave on a normal-phase column.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** We have (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and will have different polarities. Thus, they will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers have identical polarity and will co-elute, appearing as **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity. It will appear as a separate, **1 peak**.\n        *   In total, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Combining Both Reactions:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. Therefore, none of the peaks from Reaction I will overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to separate stereoisomers.\n    *   It **separates** constitutional isomers.\n    *   It **separates** diastereomers.\n    *   It **separates** enantiomers (by forming transient diastereomeric complexes with the CSP).\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** A chiral column has the ability to resolve all five unique stereoisomers produced, assuming no accidental overlap (which is a standard assumption in such problems).\n    *   **Compound 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Compound 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer of 1, will separate)\n    *   **Compound 3:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Compound 4:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer of 3, will separate on a chiral column)\n    *   **Compound 5:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Diastereomer of 3 & 4, will separate)\n*   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutional isomers and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five stereoisomers are unique and can be distinguished by a chiral column, we expect to see **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks are observed.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks are observed.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
