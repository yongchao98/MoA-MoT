    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Understand the Chemistry:** In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The formation of these complexes is governed by overall stability constants (β). The relevant equilibria are:\n    *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ;       β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])\n    *   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ;      β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²)\n    *   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ;      β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³)\n    *   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ;    β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Define the Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n4.  **Express Species Concentrations in a Common Term:** We can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻], using the stability constants:\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n5.  **Formulate the Fraction (α₂):** The fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex (which we'll call α₂) is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n    By substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4, we get:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term is common to the numerator and all terms in the denominator, so it can be canceled out:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n6.  **Check Assumptions and Plug in Values:**\n    *   We are given the initial concentration of thiocyanate as 0.1 M and the total cobalt as 0.01 M. Since the thiocyanate concentration is in large excess compared to the cobalt concentration (10-fold), the amount of thiocyanate that gets bound in complexes is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] with its initial total concentration, 0.1 M.\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n\n7.  **Calculate the Result:** We will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc**3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# The numerator is term2, which corresponds to the Co(SCN)2 complex\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all species relative to the free Co(II) ion\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n>>>\npercentage=16.916180326482276\n>>>The calculation shows that the fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%.
