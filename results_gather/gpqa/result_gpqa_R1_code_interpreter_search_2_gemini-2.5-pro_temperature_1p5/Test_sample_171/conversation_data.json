    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms or molecules over various energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium. The problem states that we can assume the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which justifies the use of this equation.\n\n### Step 1: The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels, say a higher energy level `j` and a lower energy level `i`:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j`, `N_i` are the number of atoms in the respective energy levels.\n*   `g_j`, `g_i` are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   `E_j`, `E_i` are the energies of the levels.\n*   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature of the system in Kelvin.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Equation to Each Star\n\nLet's define the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state as `R = N_excited / N_ground`.\n\nFor star_1, with effective temperature T_1, the ratio is:\nR_1 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star_2, with effective temperature T_2, the ratio is:\nR_2 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe statistical weights (`g_excited`, `g_ground`) and the energy difference (`ΔE`) are properties of the iron atom and are the same for both stars.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Information from the Problem\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means the population ratio `R` for star_1 is twice that for star_2.\n\nR_1 = 2 * R_2\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions from Step 2 into this relationship:\n\n(g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [(g_excited / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]]\n\nThe statistical weight factor `(g_excited / g_ground)` appears on both sides and can be canceled out:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n### Step 4: Solving for the Temperatures\n\nTo solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x), we get:\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\nΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nTo combine the terms in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\n### Step 5: Using the Given Numerical Values\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is a fundamental physical constant with a value of approximately `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\nLet's compute the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\nThe problem statement clearly intends for this ratio to be treated as 1. Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into our equation gives:\n\n1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis equation matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
