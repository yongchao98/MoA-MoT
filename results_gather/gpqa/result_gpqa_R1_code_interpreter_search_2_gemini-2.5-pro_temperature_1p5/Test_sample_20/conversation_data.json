    "*   **Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism for Compound A**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and readily interconvert. The most common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which requires a carbonyl group (keto form) and at least one **alpha-hydrogen** on an adjacent **sp3-hybridized carbon**. The proton from this alpha-carbon migrates to the carbonyl oxygen, and a double bond forms between the alpha-carbon and the carbonyl carbon, creating an enol.\n\n    *   **Compound 1: Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone)**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (positions 1 and 4).\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of C=C double bonds. They are sp2-hybridized, not sp3-hybridized.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on sp3-hybridized carbons, p-benzoquinone **does not** undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH2 groups.\n        *   These CH2 groups are alpha-carbons to the carbonyl groups. They are sp3-hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   These alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It can tautomerize to form a very stable aromatic enol called phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The equilibrium heavily favors this stable aromatic form.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism for Compound B**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** is exhibited by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Compound 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH3`.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), the one bonded to the -OH group.\n        *   It is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            4.  A methyl ester group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a chiral center are chiral and thus exhibit optical isomerism (exist as a pair of enantiomers).\n        *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: Dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   Structure: `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the C=C double bond.\n        *   The molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) midway through the C=C bond.\n        *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry are achiral.\n        *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not show** optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the results**\n\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
