    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the eigenvector.\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ in terms of the Pauli matrices, scaled by $\\hbar/2$. These are the standard spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle from the x-axis. Since the vector lies in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\n    So, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along** $\\vec{n}$\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is $P_n = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{P}$.\n    $P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\n    $P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n    $P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)$\n    Combining the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components**\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve the first equation for the ratio of $b$ to $a$:\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a - a\\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Now, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    This means that $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. So, the eigenvector has the form:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    To simplify this, we can choose an arbitrary value for $a$ (since the overall scale is determined by normalization). A convenient choice is $a = C \\cos(\\theta/2)$, where $C$ is a normalization constant.\n    Then, $b = (C \\cos(\\theta/2)) \\tan(\\theta/2) = C \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = C \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    So, the eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**\n    The norm of a quantum state must be 1, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\left( C^* \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) & \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = |C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n    Using the identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$, we get:\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |C|^2 (1) = 1$\n    This implies $|C|^2 = 1$. We can choose the simplest phase, $C=1$.\n\n    Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
