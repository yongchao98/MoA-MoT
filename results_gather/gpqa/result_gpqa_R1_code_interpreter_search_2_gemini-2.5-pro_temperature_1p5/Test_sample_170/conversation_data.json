    "Here is the reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring (C6H5-X) directs the incoming bromine atom to certain positions (ortho, meta, or para). This is known as the directing effect of the substituent.\n\nWe need to classify the substituents based on their effect on the benzene ring:\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct new substituents to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct new substituents to the meta position.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electron density (deactivating) but direct to ortho and para positions due to resonance.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**2. Separate into Low and High Para-Yield Groups**\n\nThe question asks for the order of increasing yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\n*   **Low Para-Yield:** The meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will produce very little para-isomer, as their primary product is the meta-isomer.\n*   **High Para-Yield:** The ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will have the meta-directing compounds first, followed by the ortho-, para-directing compounds.\n\n**(Low Yield Group: 4, 6, 2) < (High Yield Group: 1, 5, 3)**\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Groups (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these groups, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer will be inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A more strongly deactivating group will result in a lower yield of the (already unfavored) para product.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups. It will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer. (Typical para yield is <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6) and -COOC2H5 (2):** Both are strongly deactivating due to the carbonyl group. Comparing them, the -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOR group. Furthermore, experimental data for bromination shows that benzoic acid gives a slightly lower para yield (~2%) compared to ethyl benzoate (~5%).\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\nOrder: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**4. Order the Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these groups, both ortho and para products are formed. The ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio) depends on two factors:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The inductive effect of a substituent is distance-dependent and affects the ortho position more strongly than the para position.\n\nLet's compare them:\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric bulk hinders attack at the ortho position more effectively, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Yield(para-C6H4Br-C2H5) > Yield(para-C6H4Br-CH3)\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n*   **-Cl (3):** Chlorine is deactivating overall due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but it is ortho-, para-directing because of its electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The strong -I effect deactivates the nearby ortho position more than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data shows that the p/o ratio for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Yield(para-C6H4Br-Cl) > Yield(para-C6H4Br-C2H5)\n    *   Order: **5 < 3**\n\nCombining the ortho-, para-directors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\nOrder: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**5. Combine the Groups to Get the Final Order**\n\nNow, we combine the ordered subgroups:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\n**6. Match with the Given Options**\n\nLet's check the options provided:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOur derived order, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
