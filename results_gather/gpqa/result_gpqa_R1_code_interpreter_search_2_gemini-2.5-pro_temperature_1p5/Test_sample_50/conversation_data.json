    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Setup**\n\nWe have a system consisting of:\n*   A point charge `q`.\n*   A conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V_sphere = 0`).\n*   The charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (where `d > R`).\n\nWe need to find the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n\n### **2. Method of Images**\n\nThis type of problem is best solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field outside the conducting sphere can be accurately modeled by removing the sphere and replacing it with an \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen specifically to make the potential on the would-be surface of the sphere equal to zero, satisfying the grounded condition.\n\nFor a grounded sphere of radius `R` and an external charge `q` at distance `d`, the equivalent image charge (`q'`) and its position (`b`, distance from the center) are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge value:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center and the external charge `q`.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of the system.\n\n#### **Method A: Work Done to Assemble the System**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is equal to the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance (where energy is zero) to its final position at `d`.\n\n1.  **Force on the charge `q`:** The force on the charge `q` at any distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charge on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    The distance between the charge `q` (at `x`) and its image `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n    The electric force is:\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * q' / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    This is the attractive force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n\n2.  **Work done by an external agent:** The external agent must apply a force `F_ext = -F_elec` to move the charge. The potential energy `U` is the integral of this external force from infinity to `d`.\n    `U = ∫[infinity to d] F_ext(x) dx = ∫[infinity to d] (k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n\n3.  **Solve the integral:** We can use u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, which means `du = 2x dx`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * ∫[infinity to d] (1 / u^2) du`\n    The antiderivative is `-(1/u)`.\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1 / (x^2 - R^2)]_[infinity to d]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [(-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - (-1 / (infinity^2 - R^2))]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [(-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### **Method B: Using the `U = (1/2)∑Q_iV_i` Formula**\n\nThe total electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2)∑Q_iV_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `Q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n1.  **Identify charges and potentials:**\n    *   Charge 1: The point charge `q`. The potential at its location due to the other charge (the sphere) is `V_at_q`.\n    *   Charge 2: The total induced charge on the sphere, `Q_sphere`. The potential of the sphere is `V_sphere`.\n    *   The formula becomes: `U = (1/2) * [q * V_at_q + Q_sphere * V_sphere]`\n\n2.  **Use the grounded condition:** Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. The formula simplifies to:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n\n3.  **Find `V_at_q`:** The potential `V_at_q` is the potential at position `d` created by the induced charges on the sphere. According to the method of images, this is equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same position.\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   Distance from `q'` to `q`: `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Potential due to `q'` at location `d`:\n        `V_at_q = k * q' / (distance) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n        `V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the final energy:** Substitute `V_at_q` back into the simplified energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur result matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
