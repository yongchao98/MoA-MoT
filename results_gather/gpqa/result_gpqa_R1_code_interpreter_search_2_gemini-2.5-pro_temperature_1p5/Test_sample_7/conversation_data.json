As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is my reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Data:**\n    The first step is to clearly lay out the resistance levels for each genotype and calculate the loss of resistance compared to the wild-type (control) which has 100% resistance.\n\n    *   Wild-Type (WT): 100% resistance\n    *   g1 (G1 knockout): 75% resistance -> 25% loss\n    *   g2 (G2 knockout): 0% resistance -> 100% loss\n    *   g3 (G3 knockout): 50% resistance -> 50% loss\n    *   g1g2 (double knockout): 0% resistance -> 100% loss\n    *   g2g3 (double knockout): 0% resistance -> 100% loss\n    *   g1g3 (double knockout): 10% resistance -> 90% loss\n\n2.  **Analyze the Role of G2:**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows a complete loss of resistance (0%). This means G2 is absolutely essential for the resistance phenotype.\n    *   The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance. The phenotype of the `g2` mutation (0% resistance) completely masks the phenotypes of the `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance) mutations.\n    *   When one mutation masks the effect of another, this is called **epistasis**. Therefore, `g2` is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3`.\n    *   This epistatic relationship suggests that G2 acts as a master switch or is the final essential step in the pathway. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF). A TF that activates all the necessary resistance genes is a perfect candidate for this \"master switch\" role. If the TF is knocked out, none of the downstream genes are expressed, leading to a total loss of function, regardless of the status of other genes.\n    *   Conclusion: **G2 is very likely a transcription factor** essential for resistance. This conclusion eliminates option D, which claims G1 is the TF.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Relationship Between G1 and G3:**\n    *   We compare the phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant with what we would expect if their effects were simply additive.\n    *   Loss from g1 = 25%. Loss from g3 = 50%.\n    *   Expected additive loss = 25% + 50% = 75%. This would leave an expected resistance of 100% - 75% = 25%.\n    *   However, the observed resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant is only 10% (a 90% loss).\n    *   The observed effect (90% loss) is significantly greater than the sum of the individual effects (75% loss). This type of genetic interaction is called **synergy** or **synthetic enhancement**.\n    *   Synergy typically implies that the two genes (G1 and G3) function in parallel pathways that can partially compensate for each other. When only one is lost, the other pathway picks up some of the slack. When both are lost, the system collapses more dramatically than expected. This functional compensation is a form of **partial gene redundancy**.\n    *   Therefore, the statement \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is a good description of this synergistic relationship.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Based on Analysis:**\n    *   **Option A:** \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct). \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\" (This is a possible mechanism but not directly provable; \"gene redundancy\" is a better functional description). \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" (Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g3` phenotype of 50%).\n    *   **Option B:** \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct). \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" (Correct, this term accurately describes the observed synergistic interaction). \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" (Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g1` phenotype of 75%).\n    *   **Option C:** \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct). \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\" (Incorrect. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. We are only measuring one trait: resistance). \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" (Incorrect).\n    *   **Option D:** \"G1 is a transcription factor\" (Incorrect. The evidence strongly points to G2). \"G2 and G3 show pleiotropy\" (Incorrect). \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\" (This specific clause is correct, but the main premise of the option is wrong).\n\n5.  **Select the Best Fit:**\n    *   Options A, B, and C all contain an incorrect statement about epistasis between G1 and G3. This indicates a potential flaw in the question's options.\n    *   However, we must choose the *best* available option. Let's compare A and B as they are the most plausible.\n    *   Option B has two strongly supported conclusions: (1) G2 is a TF, and (2) G1 and G3 show gene redundancy/synergy.\n    *   Option A has one strongly supported conclusion (G2 is a TF) and one that is merely speculative (\"same promoter\").\n    *   Therefore, Option B provides the most accurate description of the genetic interactions, despite the error in its third clause regarding epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
