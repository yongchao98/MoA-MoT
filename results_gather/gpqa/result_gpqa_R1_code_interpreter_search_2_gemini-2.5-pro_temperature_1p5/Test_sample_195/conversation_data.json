    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem involves a relativistic harmonic oscillator. The key principle to use here is the conservation of energy. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is not just its kinetic and potential energy, but we must use the relativistic expression for kinetic energy.\n\n2.  **Define the energy components:**\n    *   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy associated with this conservative force is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position, $x=0$.\n    *   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** The kinetic energy of a particle with mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   **Total Energy (E):** The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its kinetic and potential energy, $E = K + U$. This total energy is conserved throughout the motion.\n    $E = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy:** We can find the value of the total conserved energy, $E$, by evaluating it at a point where we know the state of the system completely. The simplest point is at the maximum amplitude, $x = A$.\n\n    *   **At maximum amplitude (x = A):** The mass momentarily stops before changing direction. Therefore, its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The kinetic energy at this point is $K = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n    *   The potential energy at this point is maximum: $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is therefore: $E_{total} = K + U_{max} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the system at the equilibrium position (x = 0):** The speed of the mass is maximum ($v = v_{max}$) when it passes through the equilibrium position, where the potential energy is zero.\n\n    *   **At equilibrium position (x = 0):** The potential energy is $U = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The speed is $v_{max}$, so the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is maximum: $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is: $E_{total} = K_{max} + U = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0$.\n\n5.  **Equate the total energies:** Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n6.  **Solve for the maximum speed ($v_{max}$):** Now we rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}$.\n    *   First, isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n        $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, let's first take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}^2/c^2$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
