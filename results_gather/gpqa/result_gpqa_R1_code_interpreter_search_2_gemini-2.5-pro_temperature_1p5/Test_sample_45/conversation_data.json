    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactant and the reaction.**\n    *   The reactant is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The carbon atom at position 3 (C3) is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), and a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   The problem states the reactant is \"racemic\", which means it is a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's denote them as **R** and **S**, respectively.\n    *   The reaction is an olefin metathesis reaction, specifically a self-metathesis, catalyzed by a Grubbs catalyst. This reaction joins two alkene molecules by cutting their double bonds and re-forming new ones. The general form for a terminal alkene (R'-CH=CH₂) is:\n        2 R'-CH=CH₂  ⇌  R'-CH=CH-R' + H₂C=CH₂ (ethene)\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the structure of the main product.**\n    *   In our case, the R' group is the sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   The self-metathesis reaction of 3-methylpent-1-ene will produce ethene and a dimer. The question asks to exclude ethene.\n    *   The structure of the dimer will be:\n        [CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)]-CH=CH-[CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃]\n    *   The IUPAC name for this product is 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. This molecule has two chiral centers (at C3 and C6) and a double bond (at C4) that can have E/Z stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemical outcomes of the reaction.**\n    *   Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of **R** and **S** enantiomers, three types of coupling reactions can occur in the reaction vessel:\n        1.  Reaction of two **R** molecules (**R** + **R**)\n        2.  Reaction of two **S** molecules (**S** + **S**)\n        3.  Reaction of one **R** and one **S** molecule (**R** + **S**)\n    *   We need to analyze the products from each of these couplings, considering the stereochemistry at the new double bond (E or Z).\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the products from each coupling.**\n    *   **1. R + R coupling:**\n        *   (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene → (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n        *   This reaction can form two geometric isomers (diastereomers) around the C4=C5 double bond:\n            *   (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (chiral)\n            *   (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (chiral)\n        *   This gives us **2** distinct products.\n\n    *   **2. S + S coupling:**\n        *   (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene → (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n        *   This coupling also forms two geometric isomers:\n            *   (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (chiral)\n            *   (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (chiral)\n        *   The (E)-(3S, 6S) isomer is the enantiomer of the (E)-(3R, 6R) isomer. The (Z)-(3S, 6S) isomer is the enantiomer of the (Z)-(3R, 6R) isomer. Since enantiomers are distinct compounds, these are **2** additional distinct products.\n\n    *   **3. R + S coupling (cross-coupling):**\n        *   (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene + (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene → (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n        *   Now we must examine the products for internal symmetry. The molecule has two chiral centers with opposite configurations (R and S).\n        *   This coupling forms two geometric isomers:\n            *   **(E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene:** This molecule possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a **meso** compound.\n            *   **(Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene:** This molecule possesses a C₂ plane of symmetry that bisects the double bond. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. This is also a **meso** compound.\n        *   These two meso compounds are diastereomers of each other and of the chiral products formed above. They are **2** additional distinct products.\n\n*   **Step 5: Count the total number of distinct products.**\n    *   From **R + R** coupling: 2 chiral products.\n    *   From **S + S** coupling: 2 chiral products (the enantiomers of the R+R products).\n    *   From **R + S** coupling: 2 achiral (meso) products.\n\n    The total number of unique stereoisomeric products is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n    The six products are:\n    1.  (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n    2.  (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n    3.  (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n    4.  (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n    5.  (E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n    6.  (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n\nThus, there are 6 possible products excluding ethene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
