    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group, which accounts for 1 DoU).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for an ester (C=O) that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. A non-conjugated ester would be at a slightly higher frequency (~1735-1750 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2), as indicated by the triplet splitting (n+1=3, so n=2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3), as indicated by the quartet splitting (n+1=4, so n=3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) of the methylene group indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2) on an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a clear indication of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n*   **Conclusion and Structure Determination:**\n    *   We have a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n    *   Assembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl portion (CH3CH2CO-), not the alcohol portion. The -CH2- protons would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (not an ester) and the substitution pattern is meta (1,3), which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
