    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2. For C8H9NO, this is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4 = 5.\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Data Interpretation:**\n    *   A value around 7 ppm typically indicates aromatic protons. The two doublets at 6.98 ppm (2H) and 6.51 ppm (2H) are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   A signal at 9.72 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons, indicating a -CH2-CHO fragment. The C=O bond of the aldehyde accounts for the remaining 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The signal at 3.66 ppm is a doublet (d) integrating to 2H. This corresponds to the -CH2- protons, which are coupled to the single aldehyde proton, hence the doublet splitting.\n    *   The broad singlet (bs) at 6.27 ppm (2H) is typical for an amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group as substituents. The starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   First, the primary aromatic amine (4-aminophenylacetaldehyde) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt. This is the **diazotization reaction**.\n        H2N-C6H4-CH2CHO + NaNO2/HCl → [N2]+-C6H4-CH2CHO\n    *   Second, the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed with water (H2O), often with gentle warming, to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        [N2]+-C6H4-CH2CHO + H2O → HO-C6H4-CH2CHO + N2 + H+\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This set of reagents is used for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of aldehyde that has α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group), it will undergo a self-condensation.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        *   Aldol Addition Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. This condition promotes the dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) from the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxyl group and an α-proton are removed to form a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced by conjugation of the new C=C double bond with both the C=O group and one of the phenyl rings.\n        3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal --(Heat, -H2O)--> **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe final, most stable product formed under conditions of heat is the condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n*   The structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   Let's check the given options:\n    *   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heat.\n    *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure. Lacks the hydroxyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n    *   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**: This is the correct structure and name for the aldol condensation product.\n    *   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it results from a different reaction and has only one hydroxyphenyl group.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
