    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (also known as the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state). The decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it's a cascade process involving an intermediate state.\n\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:**\n    The selection rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n$: can be any integer (but for decay, energy must decrease, so $n'<n$).\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Initial state has $l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = l \\pm 1 = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$.\n        *   For decay, we must have $n' < 3$. The possible values are $n'=2$ or $n'=1$. However, for $n'=1$, only $l'=0$ is allowed. So, an intermediate state with $n'=1, l'=1$ does not exist.\n        *   Therefore, the only possible principal quantum number for the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n        *   The intermediate states must belong to the $n=2, l=1$ subshell (the 2p subshell).\n        *   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' = m \\pm 1 = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if transitions from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n        *   Initial state: $l'=1$. Final state: $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   Initial state: $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. Final state: $m_f=0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m' = -m'$. For all three possible values of $m'$, $\\Delta m$ is $0$ or $\\pm 1$, which satisfies the selection rule.\n        *   Thus, all three states $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ can decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The options correctly identify these states as potential intermediate steps.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The problem asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, the one through $|2,1,0\\rangle$. This is the probability of the first step occurring, multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)$\n        *   The atom starts in a single, non-degenerate, spherically symmetric state $|3,0,0\\rangle$. It can decay into three possible states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ or $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n        *   The transition rate $\\Gamma$ is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator, $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        *   For an unpolarized initial state (which $|l=0, m=0\\rangle$ intrinsically is, due to its spherical symmetry), the total decay rate to each of the magnetic sublevels of a given final ($n',l'$) will be equal. This is a consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem and the rotational symmetry of the system.\n        *   Let's denote the transition rates:\n            *   $\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$\n            *   $\\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)$\n            *   $\\Gamma_3 = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n        *   Due to symmetry, $\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma_3$.\n        *   The total decay rate of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is $\\Gamma_{tot} = \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_2 + \\Gamma_3 = 3\\Gamma_2$.\n        *   The probability (or branching ratio) of the decay proceeding via the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ channel is the ratio of the partial rate to the total rate:\n            $P_1 = \\frac{\\Gamma_2}{\\Gamma_{tot}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_2}{3\\Gamma_2} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n        *   So, the probability of the first step being $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Similarly, the probability of going to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ or $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n        *   Once the atom is in the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state, we must find its possible decay channels.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the final state must have $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n        *   For decay, the final state must have lower energy, so $n$ must be less than 2. The only possibility is $n=1$.\n        *   The only state with $n=1$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$, which has $l=0$. This is an allowed transition.\n        *   There are no states with $n<2$ and $l=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the *only* possible electric dipole decay for the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n        *   This means the probability of this second step, given the atom is in the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state, is 1.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Overall Probability:**\n    The total probability of the cascade $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each independent step:\n    $P_{total} = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, Probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, Probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    *   C) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, Probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    *   D) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, Probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n\nTherefore, the correct transition route and corresponding probability are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
