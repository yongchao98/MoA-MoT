    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for equilibrium temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   'A' is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Simplify the formula based on the given information:**\n    *   All planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant for all planets in the system.\n    *   The problem states that all planets have the same albedo (A).\n    *   This means that the term `T_star * R_star^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4) / sqrt(2)` is a constant for all five planets.\n\n    Therefore, the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is proportional to the inverse square root of the semi-major axis (a):\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)  or  T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\n\n4.  **Relate the semi-major axis (a) to the orbital period (P):** Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis:\n    P² ∝ a³\n\n    We can rearrange this to express 'a' in terms of 'P':\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Establish the relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and orbital period (P):** Substitute the proportionality for 'a' from step 4 into the proportionality for T_eq from step 3:\n    T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)\n    T_eq ∝ P^((2/3) * (-1/2))\n    T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n6.  **Calculate the ratio of the temperatures:** Now we can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Use the given orbital period ratios:** The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can find the ratio of P2 to P4:\n    P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n8.  **Compute the final value:** Substitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio formula and calculate the result.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (20 / 35)^(1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the numerical value, we can use a calculator.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_2 to Planet_4\nperiod_ratio_p2_p4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio (P2/P4).\n# T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio_p2_p4**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8298014560410427\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.8298, which rounds to 0.83. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its semi-major axis (a), assuming the star's properties and the planet's albedo are constant.\nT_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\nP² ∝ a³\nThis can be rewritten to express 'a' in terms of 'P':\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into the equilibrium temperature proportionality:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / (P^(2/3))^(1/2)\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\nT_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can set up the following equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5, respectively.\nSo, P2 = 2 (in ratio units) and P4 = 3.5 (in ratio units).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into our equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.75\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
