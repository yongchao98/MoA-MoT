    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state and the first two excited states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L` are given by:\nE_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a unit of energy E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2). Therefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels as:\nE_n = n^2 * E\n\nLet's list the first few energy levels:\n*   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n*   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n*   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n*   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n*   ...and so on.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin up or -1/2 for spin down).\n\nThis principle implies that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, n=1. One will have spin up, and the other will have spin down.\n*   We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest energy level, n=2. Again, one will be spin up, and the other spin down.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_gs = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)\nE_gs = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E)\nE_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in n=1.\n*   One particle in n=2.\n*   One particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\nE_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)\nE_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the second lowest total energy (after the first excited state).\n\nLet's list the energies of the lowest possible configurations:\n*   **Ground State:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy = 2*E1 + 2*E2 = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n*   **Excitation A (First Excited State):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy = 2*E1 + 1*E2 + 1*E3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n*   **Excitation B:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy = 1*E1 + 2*E2 + 1*E3 = 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Excitation C:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3. Configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. Energy = 2*E1 + 2*E3 = 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Excitation D:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Energy = 2*E1 + 1*E2 + 1*E4 = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the total energies of these excited states:\n1.  15E (This is the First Excited State)\n2.  18E (This is the Second Excited State)\n3.  20E (This is the Third Excited State)\n...and so on.\n\nThe energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
