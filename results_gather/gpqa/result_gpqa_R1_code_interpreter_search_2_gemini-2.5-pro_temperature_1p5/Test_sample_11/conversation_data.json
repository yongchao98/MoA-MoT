    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle into two other particles. We can solve this by applying the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Understand the decay process:**\n\nThe decay is given by:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu_mu`\n\nWhere:\n*   `Pi(+)` is a positive pion.\n*   `mu(+)` is a positive muon (an antimuon).\n*   `nu_mu` is a muon neutrino.\n\n**2. State the given information:**\n\n*   The initial pion `Pi(+)` is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of `Pi(+)`, `m_pi` = 139.6 MeV/c².\n*   Rest mass of `mu(+)`, `m_mu` = 105.7 MeV/c².\n*   The neutrino (`nu`) is a massless or nearly massless particle. In this context, we can assume its rest mass `m_nu` is 0.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n\nSince the initial pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero.\n`p_initial = 0`\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. This means the two product particles, the muon (`mu(+)`) and the neutrino (`nu`), must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n`p_final = p_mu + p_nu = 0`\nTherefore, `|p_mu| = |p_nu|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n\nThe total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n`E_initial = E_pi = m_pi * c²`\n\nThe total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n`E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`.\n`m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**5. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by the equation:\n`E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²`\n\n*   For the muon (`mu(+)`):\n    `E_mu² = (p c)² + (m_mu c²)²`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   For the neutrino (`nu`), since we assume its rest mass is zero (`m_nu = 0`):\n    `E_nu² = (p c)² + (0 * c²)² = (p c)²`\n    So, `E_nu = p c`.\n    This also means the total energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its kinetic energy (`KE_nu`).\n    `KE_nu = E_nu = p c` (Equation 2)\n\n**6. Solve for the energies:**\n\nFrom Equation 2, we can express `(p c)²` as `E_nu²`. Substitute this into Equation 1:\n`E_mu² = E_nu² + (m_mu c²)²`\n`E_mu² - E_nu² = (m_mu c²)²`\n`(E_mu - E_nu)(E_mu + E_nu) = (m_mu c²)²` (Equation 3)\n\nFrom the conservation of energy (`m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`), we can substitute `m_pi * c²` for `(E_mu + E_nu)` in Equation 3:\n`(E_mu - E_nu)(m_pi * c²) = (m_mu c²)²`\n`E_mu - E_nu = (m_mu² c⁴) / (m_pi c²) = (m_mu²/m_pi) * c²` (Equation 4)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E_mu` and `E_nu`:\n1.  `E_mu + E_nu = m_pi * c²`\n2.  `E_mu - E_nu = (m_mu²/m_pi) * c²`\n\nAdding these two equations gives:\n`2 * E_mu = (m_pi + m_mu²/m_pi) * c²`\n`E_mu = (m_pi² + m_mu²) / (2 * m_pi) * c²`\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`) is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n`KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c²`\n`KE_mu = [(m_pi² + m_mu²) / (2 * m_pi) - m_mu] * c²`\n`KE_mu = [(m_pi² + m_mu² - 2*m_pi*m_mu) / (2 * m_pi)] * c²`\n`KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)² / (2 * m_pi) * c²`\n\nNow, we can calculate `KE_mu` using the given masses:\n`KE_mu = (139.6 - 105.7)² / (2 * 139.6)` MeV\n`KE_mu = (33.9)² / (279.2)` MeV\n`KE_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2` MeV\n`KE_mu ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n\nNext, we find the kinetic energy of the neutrino, `KE_nu`.\nFrom the conservation of energy, the total kinetic energy released is the difference in rest mass energy:\n`Q = KE_mu + KE_nu = (m_pi - m_mu) * c²` (assuming `m_nu = 0`)\n`Q = (139.6 - 105.7) MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\n`KE_nu = Q - KE_mu`\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - 4.116` MeV\n`KE_nu ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of `mu(+)`: ~4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of `nu`: ~29.8 MeV\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
