    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. The product has the same molecular formula as the starting material, C11H12O, as the reaction is a rearrangement.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a **ketone carbonyl (C=O)**.\n    *   There are signals for 11 carbons in total.\n    *   Two signals in the aliphatic region, **δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm**, correspond to two methyl (CH₃) groups.\n    *   The remaining 8 carbons are in the aromatic/vinylic sp² region (δ 120-150 ppm).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   Two singlets at **δ 2.28 (3H)** and **δ 2.31 (3H)** confirm the presence of two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. This is a very important clue. For a methyl group to be a singlet, it could be part of an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O) or attached to a quaternary carbon or a substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 6.5-8.0 ppm) sum up to 6 protons.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (**δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**), is highly indicative of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   The remaining two signals, **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**, are a pair of coupled protons. Their chemical shifts suggest they are vinylic protons on a double bond (-CH=CH-). The significant deshielding (especially δ 7.68) points to conjugation with the ketone group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Let's combine these pieces to form a C11H12O molecule:\n    1.  A ketone group: -C(=O)-\n    2.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    3.  A -CH=CH- group.\n    4.  Two methyl groups.\n\n    To have two methyl singlets, one must be the acetyl methyl (-CO-CH₃) and the other must be attached to the para-position of the benzene ring (a p-tolyl group).\n\n    Let's try to assemble these fragments: `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-` (p-tolyl group), `-CH=CH-`, and `-C(=O)-CH₃` (acetyl group).\n    The most logical arrangement is **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    Structure: `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n\n    Let's verify this structure against the data:\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O. (C₇H₇ from p-tolyl + C₂H₂ from vinyl + C₂H₃O from acetyl = C₁₁H₁₂O). Correct.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   Two methyl singlets (acetyl and tolyl). Matches δ 2.28 and 2.31.\n        *   Two vinylic protons as doublets (Hα and Hβ to the carbonyl). Matches δ 6.75 and 7.68.\n        *   A p-substituted ring (4H as two doublets). Matches δ 7.08 and 7.71. (Note: While the chemical shift δ 7.71 is higher than typically observed for this specific compound, it is plausible for a theoretical spectrum and the overall pattern is correct).\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The presence of a ketone, two methyls, and 8 sp² carbons is consistent with this structure.\n\n    Thus, the product of the reaction is almost certainly (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Compound X**\n\nNow we need to find the starting material, Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O), that rearranges to this product.\n\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base), high temperature (403 K = 130 °C).\n*   **Transformation:** An isomer of (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one rearranges to form it.\n*   The options provided are all epoxides containing a vinyl or styryl group. The rearrangement of a vinyloxirane to an α,β-unsaturated ketone under basic conditions is a known and plausible reaction.\n\nLet's examine the options to see which one could be the precursor to our product:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH₃`. This molecule has a phenyl group (Ph-), not a p-tolyl group. It cannot form the p-tolyl product.\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This structure also contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** This typically refers to `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`, which has the wrong formula (C₁₀H₁₀O) and has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. The compound is `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`.\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O. Correct.\n    *   **Structure:** It contains the required p-tolyl group.\n\n**Mechanism for the rearrangement of D:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via a base-catalyzed rearrangement:\n1.  DABCO, the base, removes the most acidic proton from the epoxide. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the styryl group and on the epoxide ring is allylic and thus acidic.\n    `(p-Me-Ph)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂ + Base ⇌ (p-Me-Ph)-CH=CH-C⁻(O)CH₂ + Base-H⁺`\n2.  The resulting anion rearranges. The epoxide ring opens to form a more stable enolate anion.\n    `(p-Me-Ph)-CH=CH-C⁻(O)CH₂ → [(p-Me-Ph)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₂⁻]`\n3.  The carbanion is protonated by the protonated base to give the final product.\n    `[(p-Me-Ph)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₂⁻] + Base-H⁺ → (p-Me-Ph)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃ + Base`\n\nThis mechanism shows how **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (D)** rearranges directly to the product deduced from the NMR spectra. Therefore, Compound X must be D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
