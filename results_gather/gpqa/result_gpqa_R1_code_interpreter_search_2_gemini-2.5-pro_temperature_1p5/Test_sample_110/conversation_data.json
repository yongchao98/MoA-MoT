    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Synthesis of Product A**\n\n*   **Reactants and Reagents:** The reaction is a Michael addition between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) as the base.\n*   **Identifying the Nucleophile:** The base, t-BuOK, is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone at its α-carbon to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   It has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one α-hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the base must abstract the only available α-hydrogen from the C6 position.\n*   **The Michael Addition:** The enolate formed acts as the nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (H₂C=CH−COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Structure of Product A:**\n    1.  The starting ring has a C=O at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group at C6.\n    2.  The Michael addition adds a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group (an ethyl propanoate chain) to the C6 position.\n    3.  This makes C6 a quaternary carbon, now bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and the new propanoate chain.\n*   **Naming Product A:** The options provided name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    1.  The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    2.  The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    3.  To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as position 1.\n        *   Position 1 (original C6) has a **methyl** group.\n        *   Position 2 (original C1) has the carbonyl (**oxo**) group.\n        *   Position 3 (original C2) has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    4.  Combining these gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    5.  Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the structure of A in options A and D.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Synthesis of Product B**\n\n*   **Reactants and Reagents:** This is a Michael addition between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the base in water.\n*   **Identifying the Nucleophile:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group). This forms a nitronate anion, which is a potent carbon nucleophile.\n    *   Nucleophile: `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`\n*   **The Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the deprotonated 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n*   **Structure of Product B:**\n    1.  A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane component and the β-carbon of the nitrile component.\n    2.  The resulting molecule's backbone is formed by linking these two parts: `(from nitropropane part) CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - (from nitrile part) CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n*   **Naming Product B:** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority and determines the numbering of the parent chain.\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is a 6-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    2.  We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    3.  The substituents on this chain are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    4.  Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis matches the structure of B in options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option A correctly identifies both products.\n\nA) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\nB) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\nC) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\nD) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
