    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common ways to check for chirality are to look for stereocenters and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. A carbon atom must be bonded to four different groups to be a chiral center. No such carbon exists in this molecule.\n    *   The molecule is largely planar around the C=C double bond. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry and no chiral centers, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex, polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` specify a single, specific stereoisomer. When a compound is named as a single enantiomer (using R/S or similar notation), it implies that the molecule is chiral and that this specific form has been isolated or synthesized.\n    *   While the parent ring system without the substituent at position 8 might have a plane of symmetry, the `=CHCl` group at this position breaks that symmetry. The molecule as a whole is asymmetric.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is by definition optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   To determine if the `(2R,3S)` isomer is chiral, we check for internal symmetry. A Fischer projection is helpful:\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n          H -|- CH3   (2R)\n              |\n        CH3 -|- H     (3S)\n              |\n             COOH\n        ```\n    *   A horizontal line drawn between C2 and C3 reveals a plane of symmetry. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters that also has a plane of symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   Let's draw the Fischer projection for the `(2R,3R)` isomer:\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n          H -|- CH3   (2R)\n              |\n          H -|- CH3   (3R)\n              |\n             COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, which is non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, the `(2R,3R)` isomer is a chiral molecule (it is one of a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, indicating it is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` typically indicates that all three OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. If all OH groups are axial, the molecule possesses a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (Ïƒv).\n    *   Similarly, if all OH groups are equatorial (the other chair conformer), it also possesses C3v symmetry.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, regardless of the presence of stereogenic centers. All stereoisomers of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol are in fact achiral meso compounds.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon atom C3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-` group, and two identical methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since two of the attached groups are identical, C3 is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The cyclopentyl ring is also symmetrically substituted.\n    *   The molecule can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3-H bond, the C2-C3 bond, the carbonyl group, and the C1' of the cyclopentyl ring. This plane would reflect the two methyl groups at C3 onto each other.\n    *   The absence of any chiral centers and the presence of a plane of symmetry mean the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Optically Active:\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n*   Optically Inactive:\n    1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    4.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
