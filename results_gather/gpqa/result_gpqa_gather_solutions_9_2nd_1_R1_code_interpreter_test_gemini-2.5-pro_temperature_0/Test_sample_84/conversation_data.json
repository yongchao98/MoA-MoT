Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting the same star. The ratio is expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio**\nWhen we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets, the terms related to the star ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) and the albedo ($A$, which is given as the same for both planets) cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n(The assumption $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ is justified because the planets were detected by the transit method, which requires an edge-on orbit).\n\nRearranging this formula to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nNow, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\nThe constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**6. Combine Formulas and Substitute Values**\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the $K$ values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nSubstitute these ratios into the final equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\nA vast majority of the agents (13 out of 15) correctly derived the physics and calculated the numerical answer to be approximately 0.536. However, many of them made a simple error in the final step by matching this result to the wrong letter option. The agents who performed the entire process correctly (derivation, calculation, and option selection) concluded that the answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$).\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, we divide the equation for Planet 1 by the equation for Planet 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). These terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are nearly edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The terms for the gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) will cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### 5. Connecting Doppler Shift to RV Amplitude\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) via the equation $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n### 6. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, substitute this result into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leading to the final simplified formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.

Then, I will use the provided radial velocity data (in the form of Doppler shifts) and planet masses to determine the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes. Finally, I will combine these relationships to calculate the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.\n\nHere are the detailed steps:\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) shows it is proportional to the inverse square root of its semi-major axis ($a$), i.e., $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$. All other factors, like the star's properties and the planets' albedos, are the same for both and cancel out when taking a ratio. This gives us the relationship: $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2} = \\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}$.\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star. The relationship is $a \\propto (M_p / K)^2$. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is $a_2 / a_1 = (M_{p2} / M_{p1})^2 \\times (K_1 / K_2)^2$.\n3.  **Radial Velocity Ratio:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Thus, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** By substituting the relationships from steps 2 and 3 into the equation from step 1, we get the final formula for the temperature ratio: $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2} = (M_{p2} / M_{p1}) \\times (\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2)$. I will use a Python script to perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# --- Step-by-step Derivation ---\n# 1.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures**\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms except for the semi-major axis `a` cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis is a critical simplification: the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe semi-major axis `a` is not given directly, but we can derive it from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis formula assumes the planet's mass (M_p) is much less than the star's mass (M_star) and that the orbital inclination `i` is approximately 90° (so sin(i) ≈ 1). The use of the transit method for detection makes the sin(i) ≈ 1 assumption valid.\n\n**5. Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nWe need to rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe constants G (gravitational constant) and M_star (star's mass) cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**6. Connect Doppler Shift to RV Amplitude**\nThe RV amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**7. Combine Formulas and Calculate**\nSubstitute the relationship from step 6 into the equation from step 5:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this entire expression back into the temperature ratio formula from step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leading to the final simplified formula:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**8. Plug in the Values**\n*   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5/7\n*   Doppler shift ratio: Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4) = 15/28\n\n**9. Final Answer**\nConvert the fraction to a decimal:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe calculation performed by the code confirms the result derived from the physical formulas.\n\n**1. Derivation Summary:**\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) was found to simplify to the following expression:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**2. Plugging in Values:**\n*   Mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 / 7\n*   Doppler shift ratio (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28\n\n**4.

Analyze the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ = Star's effective temperature\n*   $R_*$ = Star's radius\n*   $a$ = Planet's semi-major axis\n*   $A$ = Planet's albedo\n\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, we divide the equation for Planet 1 by the equation for Planet 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $M_p$ = Planet's mass\n*   $M_*$ = Star's mass\n*   $i$ = Orbital inclination\n*   $G$ = Gravitational constant\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem states the planets were detected using both the transit and RV methods. A transit can only be observed if the planet's orbit is nearly edge-on from our perspective, which means the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$. Therefore, we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n### 4. Determine the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constant terms $G$ and $M_*$ will cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### 5. Relate Doppler Shift to RV Amplitude\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) it causes ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n### 6. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, substitute this result back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, leaving the final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to the option **B) ~ 0.53**.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while most derived the correct numerical value, many made an error in selecting the corresponding letter option.

Goal Identification\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which can be expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\nT_eq = T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_* / (2a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_*` is the star's radius.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we divide the equation for Planet 1 by the equation for Planet 2. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_eff` and `R_*` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(R_* / (2a₁)) / √(R_* / (2a₂))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂)\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) **\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_*) * √(G * M_* / a)\n\nThis formula relies on two key points from the problem description:\n*   The orbits are circular.\n*   The planets were detected by the transit method, which implies an orbital inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_*²) * (G * M_* / a)\nK² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (a * M_*)\n**a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_* * K²) **\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁. The terms for the gravitational constant (`G`) and the star's mass (`M_*`) will cancel out as they are the same for both planets:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_* * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_* * K₁²) ]\n**a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² **\n\n### 5. Final Derivation and Calculation\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (since K = c * Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\nSubstitute this into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this entire expression back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂) **\n\nFinally, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p₁): 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p₂): 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁): 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂): 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis calculated value is closest to the option ~0.53.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overwhelming majority of the provided candidate answers correctly derive the formula and calculate the result to be approximately 0.5357. The discrepancies in their final choices appear to be errors in matching the calculated value to the correct option letter.

Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n\nWhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is its radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nWhen we create a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and having the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n\nThis is a critical first step.

The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\nThis approximation is valid because the planets were detected by the transit method, which implies their orbital inclination `i` is ~90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n\n`K² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`. The terms for the gravitational constant (`G`) and the star's mass (`M_star`) will cancel out:\n\n`a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]`\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)`\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n### 4. Connecting Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K = c * Δλ / λ₀`). Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`\n\n### 5. Final Formula\nSubstitute the relationship from step 4 into the equation from step 3, and then substitute that result into the equation from step 2:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² )`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )`\n\nThis simplifies to the final working formula:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`\n\n### 6. Calculation\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p₁): 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p₂): 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁): 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂): 0.04 Å\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n### 7.

Combining the Ratios**\nSubstitute the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio formula from Step 2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² )`\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leading to a very simple final formula:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n\n### **6. Final Calculation**\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K ∝ Δλ`). Therefore, the ratio `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mass ratio: `M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5 / 7`\n*   Doppler shift ratio: `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\nNow, plug these values into the final formula:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n### **7.

Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`).\n\n**Key Formulas:**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (`T_eq`):** The temperature of a planet based on the energy balance with its star.\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a))`\n    where `T_star`, `R_star` are the star's temperature and radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Semi-amplitude (`K`):** The maximum speed of the star's \"wobble\" caused by an orbiting planet. For a circular orbit and `sin(i) ≈ 1` (which is a valid assumption for a transiting planet):\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    where `M_p`, `M_star` are the planet and star masses, `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n*   **Doppler Shift (`Δλ`):** The change in wavelength of light due to the star's motion. It is directly proportional to the radial velocity.\n    `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)`\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Simplify the Temperature Ratio:**\n    We need the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star`, `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out from the `T_eq` formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2*a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2*a₂)) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a₂ / a₁`):**\n    We must derive this from the radial velocity data. First, rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\n    `K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)`\n    `a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\n    Now, form the ratio `a₂ / a₁`. The constants `G` and `M_star` will cancel:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]`\n    `a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:**\n    Substitute the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² )`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n\n4.  **Use the Doppler Shift Data:**\n    The ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (`K₁ / K₂`) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`):\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`\n    So, the final formula is:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`\n\n### **3.

When taking the ratio for two planets around the same star ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$ are constant) and with the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the formula simplifies significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This simplification is correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The semi-major axis ($a$) is not given directly but can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    A critical piece of information is that the planets were detected by both the transit and RV methods. The transit method requires the orbital inclination ($i$) to be close to 90°, meaning $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\n3.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** By rearranging the formula for K to solve for $a$, we get:\n    $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n    The ratio of the semi-major axes for the two planets is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n    This derivation is also consistently and correctly performed in the candidate answers.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation Formula:** Substituting the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation gives:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n    Since the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$), the ratio $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$ is identical to the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$. The final formula for the calculation is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unnecessary Information:** The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed to solve for the ratio. They are contextual details.\n*   **Transit Method Justification:** The mention of the transit method is crucial as it justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Without this, the term $\\sin(i)$ would remain in the equations.\n*   **Calculation vs. Option Selection:** The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly derive the physics and perform the calculation, arriving at a value of ~0.5357. The primary source of error in the provided answers is incorrectly matching this calculated value to the multiple-choice letters.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nUsing the derived formula and the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ M_earth}}{7 \\text{ M_earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis calculated value of approximately 0.53 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Goal Identification\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\nT_eq = T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWhen calculating the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, the terms for the star's properties (`T_eff`, `R_star`) and the albedo (`A`), which are stated to be the same for both planets, cancel out.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ ... √(1/a₁) ... ] / [ ... √(1/a₂) ... ] = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis shows the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity Data\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis assumes an orbital inclination `i` of 90° (so sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a valid assumption because the planets were detected by the transit method, which requires a nearly edge-on orbit.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 4. Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁. The terms for the gravitational constant (`G`) and the star's mass (`M_star`) will cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 5. Final Derivation\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (K ∝ Δλ). Therefore, the ratio K₁ / K₂ is equal to the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n### 6. Calculation\nWe plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 7. Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.53. The majority of the provided answers correctly derived this value, even if some of them selected the wrong final option. The physics and the calculation consistently point to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal and Relevant Physics\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\nT_eq = T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_* / (2a))\nwhere:\n*   T_eff is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_* is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n### 2. Simplify the Ratio\nWhen we create the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, several terms cancel out because both planets orbit the same star (T_eff and R_* are constant) and they are stated to have the same albedo (A).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_* / (2a₁))] / [T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_* / (2a₂))]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_* / (2a₁)) / sqrt(R_* / (2a₂))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis is a critical simplification: the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Determine the Semi-Major Axis Ratio\nThe semi-major axis `a` is not given directly, but it can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_*) * sqrt(G * M_* / a)\n\nThis assumes the planet's mass (M_p) is much less than the star's mass (M_*) and that the orbital inclination is ~90° (so sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected by the transit method.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_*²) * (G * M_* / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_* * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁. The terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_*) will cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_* * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_* * K₁²)]\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 4. Combine Formulas and Substitute Data\nThe RV semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for a₂ / a₁ gives:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, we substitute this back into our simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nWe can now plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 6.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Goal**\nThe main goal is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, orbiting the same star. The ratio is expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nWhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, we divide the equation for Planet 1 by the equation for Planet 2. The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). These common terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio significantly:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### **3. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) is not given directly, but it can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\nWhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$.

Apply Careful Points and Simplifications**\n*   **Unnecessary Information:** The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed to solve for the ratio. They are contextual details that cancel out.\n*   **The `sin(i)` Term:** A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are nearly edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets. Therefore, we can assume $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the sine terms cancel from the ratio.\n*   **Doppler Shift and RV Amplitude:** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ it causes ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nWith these simplifications, the ratio of the semi-major axes becomes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### **5.

The formula simplifies to:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The terms for the gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) will cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### 5. Connecting Doppler Shift to RV Amplitude\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) via the equation $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n### 6. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, substitute this result into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leading to the final simplified formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.

Then, I will use the provided radial velocity data (in the form of Doppler shifts) and planet masses to determine the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes. Finally, I will combine these relationships to calculate the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.\n\nHere are the detailed steps:\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) shows it is proportional to the inverse square root of its semi-major axis ($a$), i.e., $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$. All other factors, like the star's properties and the planets' albedos, are the same for both and cancel out when taking a ratio. This gives us the relationship: $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2} = \\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}$.\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star. The relationship is $a \\propto (M_p / K)^2$. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is $a_2 / a_1 = (M_{p2} / M_{p1})^2 \\times (K_1 / K_2)^2$.\n3.  **Radial Velocity Ratio:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Thus, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** By substituting the relationships from steps 2 and 3 into the equation from step 1, we get the final formula for the temperature ratio: $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2} = (M_{p2} / M_{p1}) \\times (\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2)$. I will use a Python script to perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# --- Step-by-step Derivation ---\n# 1.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures**\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms except for the semi-major axis `a` cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis is a critical simplification: the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe semi-major axis `a` is not given directly, but we can derive it from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis formula assumes the planet's mass (M_p) is much less than the star's mass (M_star) and that the orbital inclination `i` is approximately 90° (so sin(i) ≈ 1). The use of the transit method for detection makes the sin(i) ≈ 1 assumption valid.\n\n**5. Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nWe need to rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe constants G (gravitational constant) and M_star (star's mass) cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**6. Connect Doppler Shift to RV Amplitude**\nThe RV amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**7. Combine Formulas and Calculate**\nSubstitute the relationship from step 6 into the equation from step 5:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this entire expression back into the temperature ratio formula from step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leading to the final simplified formula:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**8. Plug in the Values**\n*   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5/7\n*   Doppler shift ratio: Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4) = 15/28\n\n**9. Final Answer**\nConvert the fraction to a decimal:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe calculation performed by the code confirms the result derived from the physical formulas.\n\n**1. Derivation Summary:**\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) was found to simplify to the following expression:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**2. Plugging in Values:**\n*   Mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 / 7\n*   Doppler shift ratio (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28\n\n**4. Numerical Result:**\nThe code output confirms the numerical value:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\n**5. Matching with Options:**\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the given choices:\n*   A) ~ 0.53\n*   B) ~ 1.05\n*   C) ~ 1.30\n*   D) ~ 0.98\n\nThe value 0.5357 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ = Star's effective temperature\n*   $R_*$ = Star's radius\n*   $a$ = Planet's semi-major axis\n*   $A$ = Planet's albedo\n\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, we divide the equation for Planet 1 by the equation for Planet 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $M_p$ = Planet's mass\n*   $M_*$ = Star's mass\n*   $i$ = Orbital inclination\n*   $G$ = Gravitational constant\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem states the planets were detected using both the transit and RV methods. A transit can only be observed if the planet's orbit is nearly edge-on from our perspective, which means the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$. Therefore, we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n### 4. Determine the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constant terms $G$ and $M_*$ will cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### 5. Relate Doppler Shift to RV Amplitude\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) it causes ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n### 6. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, substitute this result back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, leaving the final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to the option **B) ~ 0.53**.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while most derived the correct numerical value, many made an error in selecting the corresponding letter option. The derivation and calculation clearly point to ~0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Goal Identification\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which can be expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\nT_eq = T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_* / (2a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_*` is the star's radius.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we divide the equation for Planet 1 by the equation for Planet 2. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_eff` and `R_*` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(R_* / (2a₁)) / √(R_* / (2a₂))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂)\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) **\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_*) * √(G * M_* / a)\n\nThis formula relies on two key points from the problem description:\n*   The orbits are circular.\n*   The planets were detected by the transit method, which implies an orbital inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_*²) * (G * M_* / a)\nK² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (a * M_*)\n**a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_* * K²) **\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁. The terms for the gravitational constant (`G`) and the star's mass (`M_*`) will cancel out as they are the same for both planets:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_* * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_* * K₁²) ]\n**a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² **\n\n### 5. Final Derivation and Calculation\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (since K = c * Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\nSubstitute this into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this entire expression back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂) **\n\nFinally, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p₁): 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p₂): 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁): 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂): 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis calculated value is closest to the option ~0.53.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overwhelming majority of the provided candidate answers correctly derive the formula and calculate the result to be approximately 0.5357.

Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n\nWhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is its radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nWhen we create a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and having the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n\nThis is a critical first step.

The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\nThis approximation is valid because the planets were detected by the transit method, which implies their orbital inclination `i` is ~90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n\n`K² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`. The terms for the gravitational constant (`G`) and the star's mass (`M_star`) will cancel out:\n\n`a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]`\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)`\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n### 4. Connecting Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K = c * Δλ / λ₀`). Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\n`K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`\n\n### 5.

Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a))`\nwhere `T_star` and `R_star` are the star's temperature and radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a₂))]`\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n### **3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nThis formula is valid because the planets were detected by the transit method, which implies an orbital inclination `i` of approximately 90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n\n### **4. Deriving the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nWe can rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\n`K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`:\n`a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]`\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` are the same for both and cancel out:\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n### **5. Combining the Ratios**\nSubstitute the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio formula from Step 2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² )`\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leading to a very simple final formula:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n\n### **6. Final Calculation**\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K ∝ Δλ`). Therefore, the ratio `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mass ratio: `M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5 / 7`\n*   Doppler shift ratio: `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\nNow, plug these values into the final formula:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n### **7. Conclusion**\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated value `0.5357` is closest to `0.53`.

Goal Identification**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n**3. Finding the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$)**\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This implies that their orbits are nearly edge-on to our line of sight, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\left(\\frac{M_p}{M_*}\\right)^2 \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**4. Relating Doppler Shift to RV Semi-Amplitude**\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the $K$ values is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ from step 3 into the temperature ratio formula from step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\nNow, substitute the Doppler shift ratio from step 4:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nPlug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly derive the physics and perform the calculation, arriving at the result of ~0.536.

Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures**\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$).

Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe semi-major axis can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The semi-amplitude of the RV curve ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{M_p}{M_*}\\right)^2 \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**6.

Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`).\n\n**Key Formulas:**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (`T_eq`):** The temperature of a planet based on the energy balance with its star.\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a))`\n    where `T_star`, `R_star` are the star's temperature and radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Semi-amplitude (`K`):** The maximum speed of the star's \"wobble\" caused by an orbiting planet. For a circular orbit and `sin(i) ≈ 1` (which is a valid assumption for a transiting planet):\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    where `M_p`, `M_star` are the planet and star masses, `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n*   **Doppler Shift (`Δλ`):** The change in wavelength of light due to the star's motion. It is directly proportional to the radial velocity.\n    `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)`\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Simplify the Temperature Ratio:**\n    We need the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star`, `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out from the `T_eq` formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2*a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2*a₂)) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a₂ / a₁`):**\n    We must derive this from the radial velocity data. First, rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\n    `K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)`\n    `a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\n    Now, form the ratio `a₂ / a₁`. The constants `G` and `M_star` will cancel:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]`\n    `a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:**\n    Substitute the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² )`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n\n4.  **Use the Doppler Shift Data:**\n    The ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (`K₁ / K₂`) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`):\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`\n    So, the final formula is:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`\n\n### **3. Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `M_p1 = 7 M_earth`\n*   `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n*   `Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å`\n*   `Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å`\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\nThe decimal value is `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\n### **4.

When taking the ratio for two planets around the same star ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$ are constant) and with the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the formula simplifies significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This simplification is correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The semi-major axis ($a$) is not given directly but can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    A critical piece of information is that the planets were detected by both the transit and RV methods. The transit method requires the orbital inclination ($i$) to be close to 90°, meaning $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\n3.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** By rearranging the formula for K to solve for $a$, we get:\n    $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n    The ratio of the semi-major axes for the two planets is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n    This derivation is also consistently and correctly performed in the candidate answers.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation Formula:** Substituting the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation gives:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n    Since the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$), the ratio $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$ is identical to the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis assumes an orbital inclination `i` of 90° (so sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a valid assumption because the planets were detected by the transit method, which requires a nearly edge-on orbit.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 4. Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁. The terms for the gravitational constant (`G`) and the star's mass (`M_star`) will cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 5. Final Derivation\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (K ∝ Δλ). Therefore, the ratio K₁ / K₂ is equal to the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n### 6.

Simplify the Ratio\nWhen we create the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, several terms cancel out because both planets orbit the same star (T_eff and R_* are constant) and they are stated to have the same albedo (A).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_* / (2a₁))] / [T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_* / (2a₂))]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_* / (2a₁)) / sqrt(R_* / (2a₂))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis is a critical simplification: the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Determine the Semi-Major Axis Ratio\nThe semi-major axis `a` is not given directly, but it can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_*) * sqrt(G * M_* / a)\n\nThis assumes the planet's mass (M_p) is much less than the star's mass (M_*) and that the orbital inclination is ~90° (so sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected by the transit method.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_*²) * (G * M_* / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_* * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁. The terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_*) will cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_* * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_* * K₁²)]\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 4. Combine Formulas and Substitute Data\nThe RV semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for a₂ / a₁ gives:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, we substitute this back into our simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nWe can now plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 6.
