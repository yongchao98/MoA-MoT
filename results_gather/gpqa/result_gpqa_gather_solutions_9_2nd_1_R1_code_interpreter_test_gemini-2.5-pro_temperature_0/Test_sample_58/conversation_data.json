Calculate the initial moles of each species:**\n\n*   **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (L)\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   As a strong acid, HCl dissociates completely into H⁺ and Cl⁻.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = Molarity × Volume (L)\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   As a strong base, Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely into Ba²⁺ and 2OH⁻. It is crucial to note that each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of OH⁻.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = Molarity × Volume (L) × 2\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Perform neutralization reactions:**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons. The reaction with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will occur first, followed by the reaction with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Strong Acid-Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   The 0.180 mol of OH⁻ reacts with the 0.080 mol of H⁺ from HCl.\n    *   Since H⁺ is the limiting reactant, all of it is consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol**\n\n*   **Step 2b: Strong Base-Weak Acid Neutralization**\n    *   The remaining 0.100 mol of OH⁻ reacts with the 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Since CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant in this step, all of it is consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration and pH:**\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of a strong base (OH⁻). This excess strong base will be the primary determinant of the solution's pH.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles:** I will first calculate the number of moles for each of the three substances: the weak acid (CH3COOH), the strong acid (HCl), and the strong base (Ba(OH)2). A critical point here is to remember that one mole of Ba(OH)2 dissociates to produce two moles of hydroxide ions (OH-).\n2.  **Perform Neutralization:** I will simulate the neutralization reactions. The total moles of the base (OH-) will react with the total moles of acid. Since both a strong and a weak acid are present, and they are reacting with a strong base, the reactions will go to completion. The strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n3.  **Determine Excess Reactant:** I will compare the total moles of acid to the total moles of base to determine which one is in excess. The final solution's pH will be dictated by this excess species.\n4.  **Calculate Final Concentration:** I will calculate the total volume of the mixed solution by summing the individual volumes. Then, I'll find the concentration of the excess reactant (H+ or OH-) by dividing its excess moles by the total volume.\n5.  **Calculate pH:** If there is excess OH-, I will first calculate the pOH using the formula pOH = -log[OH-], and then find the pH using the relationship pH = 14 - pOH. If there were excess H+, I would calculate the pH directly using pH = -log[H+].\n6.  **Final Decision:** Based on the calculated pH, I will select the correct option from the choices provided.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define initial conditions and calculate moles\n# CH3COOH (weak acid)\nvol_ch3cooh = 500 / 1000  # 0.500 L\nconc_ch3cooh = 0.1       # M\nmoles_ch3cooh = vol_ch3cooh * conc_ch3cooh\n\n# HCl (strong acid)\nvol_hcl = 400 / 1000  # 0.400 L\nconc_hcl = 0.2       # M\n# HCl is a strong acid, so moles H+ = moles HCl\nmoles_h_strong = vol_hcl * conc_hcl\n\n# Ba(OH)2 (strong base)\nvol_baoh2 = 300 / 1000  # 0.300 L\nconc_baoh2 = 0.3       # M\nmoles_baoh2 = vol_baoh2 * conc_baoh2\n# Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH- per mole of Ba(OH)2\nmoles_oh_strong = 2 * moles_baoh2\n\n# Step 2 & 3: Perform neutralization and find excess reactant\n# The strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons\ntotal_moles_acid = moles_h_strong + moles_ch3cooh\ntotal_moles_base = moles_oh_strong\n\n# Since total_moles_base > total_moles_acid, the base is in excess.\nmoles_oh_excess = total_moles_base - total_moles_acid\n\n# Step 4: Calculate final concentration\n# Calculate the total volume of the solution.\ntotal_volume = vol_ch3cooh + vol_hcl + vol_baoh2\n\n# Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-.\nconc_oh_excess = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final pH\n# Calculate pOH from the concentration of OH-.\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh_excess)\n\n# Calculate pH from pOH (pH + pOH = 14).\npH = 14 - pOH\n\n# Step 6: Print the final result and the options.\nprint(f\"Initial moles of CH3COOH: {moles_ch3cooh:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Initial moles of H+ from HCl: {moles_h_strong:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Initial moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: {moles_oh_strong:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Total moles of acid: {total_moles_acid:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Total moles of base: {total_moles_base:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Excess moles of OH-: {moles_oh_excess:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Total volume: {total_volume:.3f} L\")\nprint(f\"Final [OH-]: {conc_oh_excess:.5f} M\")\nprint(f\"Calculated pOH: {pOH:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated pH: {pH:.2f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(\"A) 8.68\")\nprint(\"B) 12.62\")\nprint(\"C) 1.38\")\nprint(\"D) 8.92\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.050 mol\nInitial moles of H+ from HCl: 0.080 mol\nInitial moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.180 mol\nTotal moles of acid: 0.130 mol\nTotal moles of base: 0.180 mol\nExcess moles of OH-: 0.050 mol\nTotal volume: 1.200 L\nFinal [OH-]: 0.04167 M\nCalculated pOH: 1.38\nCalculated pH: 12.62\n\nChoices:\nA) 8.68\nB) 12.62\nC) 1.38\nD) 8.92\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Perform the Neutralization Reaction**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH). We can sum the total moles of acid and compare them to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles CH3COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Compare total base (0.180 mol) to total acid (0.130 mol).\n    *   Since moles of base > moles of acid, the base is in excess.\n    *   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total Base - Total Acid\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol OH⁻**\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Concentration and pH**\nThe final pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This value (1.38) is the pOH, not the pH.

This corresponds to option A. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most perform the calculation correctly to arrive at 12.62, several select the wrong final letter. The calculation itself is robust and consistently points to 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires us to determine the final pH of a solution created by mixing a weak acid (CH₃COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)₂).

We can sum the total moles of acid and compare them to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Compare the total moles of base (0.180 mol) to the total moles of acid (0.130 mol).\n    *   Since moles of base > moles of acid, the final solution will be basic due to an excess of OH⁻.\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final pH.**\n\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe calculated pH is 12.62.

Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Identify Species:** The solution contains a weak acid (CH₃COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)₂).\n*   **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** A critical point is that Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that dissociates to yield *two* hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every one formula unit. This is a common point of error if missed.\n*   **Reaction Order:** Neutralization reactions between a strong acid and a strong base are effectively instantaneous and go to completion. Therefore, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂) first. Any remaining strong base will then react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Final pH Determinant:** After all neutralization reactions are complete, the pH will be determined by the species present in excess. If a strong acid or strong base is in excess, it will be the primary determinant of the pH. The contribution from any weak acid or weak base formed will be negligible in comparison.\n*   **pOH to pH Conversion:** If excess hydroxide (OH⁻) remains, the calculation will first yield the pOH. A final, crucial step is to convert pOH to pH using the formula: pH = 14 - pOH (at 25°C). Mistaking the pOH for the pH is a frequent mistake.\n\n**2.

Careful Analysis of the Steps**\n\n*   **Point 1: Calculate Initial Moles of Each Species**\n    The first step is to calculate the number of moles of the weak acid (CH₃COOH), the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl), and the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂). A critical point here is to recognize that Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates to yield **two** hydroxide ions for each formula unit.\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.500 L × 0.1 M = **0.050 mol**\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.400 L × 0.2 M = **0.080 mol**\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) = 0.300 L × 0.3 M × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n*   **Point 2: Perform Neutralization Reactions**\n    The strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons. The reaction proceeds until the limiting reactant is consumed. It is conceptually clearest to neutralize the strong acid first, followed by the weak acid.\n    *   **Total moles of acid:** 0.080 mol (strong) + 0.050 mol (weak) = **0.130 mol**\n    *   **Total moles of base:** **0.180 mol**\n    *   Comparing the two, the base is in excess.\n    *   **Moles of excess OH⁻:** 0.180 mol (total base) - 0.130 mol (total acid) = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Point 3: Determine Final Concentration**\n    The pH of the final solution is dictated by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻). The contribution from the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) that was formed is negligible in the presence of a strong base. To find the concentration, we must use the total volume of the mixed solution.\n    *   **Total Volume:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n    *   **Final [OH⁻]:** (0.050 mol) / (1.200 L) ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Point 4: Calculate pH**\n    From the hydroxide concentration, we first calculate the pOH. Then, we find the pH. A common mistake is to report the pOH value as the final answer.\n    *   **pOH:** -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **pH:** 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation, verified across the majority of the provided answers and through independent analysis, consistently yields a final pH of 12.62.

HCl is a strong acid (dissociates completely), CH₃COOH is a weak acid (dissociates partially), and Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base (dissociates completely).\n*   **Stoichiometry of Dissociation:** A common error is to forget that Ba(OH)₂ releases two moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every one mole of Ba(OH)₂.\n*   **Order of Neutralization:** The strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons. The reaction proceeds to completion, first with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and then with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Determining the Final pH:** The final pH is determined by the species in excess. If a strong acid or strong base is in excess, the pH calculation is straightforward. The contribution from any weak species (like the conjugate base CH₃COO⁻ in this case) is negligible compared to the excess strong base.\n*   **pOH vs. pH:** A frequent mistake is to calculate the pOH from the excess [OH⁻] and report that as the final answer, instead of converting it to pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n**2.

    "Based on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and an independent verification of the calculation, here is a step-by-step breakdown and list of crucial points for solving the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles of Acidic and Basic Species:** The first step is to determine the amount (in moles) of all reactive species.\n    *   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n        0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n    *   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n        0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n        0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n2.  **Perform Neutralization:** The total moles of base (OH⁻) are compared against the total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents). The strong base will neutralize all available protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n    *   **Total moles of acid:** 0.050 mol (from CH₃COOH) + 0.080 mol (from HCl) = **0.130 mol**\n    *   **Total moles of base:** **0.180 mol**\n    *   **Determine Excess Reactant:** Since the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130), the strong base is in excess.\n    *   **Moles of excess OH⁻:** 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Concentration:** The concentration of the excess hydroxide ions will determine the final pH. This concentration is found by dividing the excess moles by the total volume of the solution.\n    *   **Total Volume:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n    *   **Final [OH⁻]:** 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate Final pH:** From the hydroxide concentration, we first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n    *   **Calculate pOH:** pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Calculate pH:** pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** A critical point is recognizing that Ba(OH)₂ is a dihydroxide base, meaning each mole provides two moles of OH⁻. Forgetting this factor of 2 is a common mistake.\n*   **Neutralization of Weak Acid:** The strong base (Ba(OH)₂) is strong enough to completely neutralize the weak acid (CH₃COOH) in this context, as the strong base is the excess reactant.\n*   **pOH vs. pH:** A very common error is to calculate the pOH (1.38) and mistake it for the final pH. Option A (1.38) is a classic distractor for this reason. The question asks for the pH, which requires the final conversion step (pH = 14 - pOH).\n*   **Matching Value to Option:** After correctly calculating the pH as 12.62, it is essential to match it to the correct lettered option.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently and unambiguously yields a pH of **12.62**. Comparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1.38\nB) 12.62\nC) 8.92\nD) 8.68\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

A critical point here is to remember that one mole of Ba(OH)2 dissociates to produce two moles of hydroxide ions (OH-).\n2.  **Perform Neutralization:** I will simulate the neutralization reactions. The total moles of the base (OH-) will react with the total moles of acid. Since both a strong and a weak acid are present, and they are reacting with a strong base, the reactions will go to completion. The strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n3.  **Determine Excess Reactant:** I will compare the total moles of acid to the total moles of base to determine which one is in excess. The final solution's pH will be dictated by this excess species.\n4.  **Calculate Final Concentration:** I will calculate the total volume of the mixed solution by summing the individual volumes. Then, I'll find the concentration of the excess reactant (H+ or OH-) by dividing its excess moles by the total volume.\n5.  **Calculate pH:** If there is excess OH-, I will first calculate the pOH using the formula pOH = -log[OH-], and then find the pH using the relationship pH = 14 - pOH.

Identify the Reactants and Their Nature**\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** A weak acid.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** A strong acid. It dissociates completely to H⁺ and Cl⁻.\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide):** A strong base. It dissociates completely to Ba²⁺ and 2OH⁻.\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Moles of Acidic and Basic Species**\nThe first step is to calculate the number of moles of H⁺ ions (from both acids) and OH⁻ ions (from the base).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol H⁺**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   **Careful Point:** Ba(OH)2 is a dihydroxide base, meaning each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH⁻.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH⁻**\n\n**3. Perform the Neutralization Reaction**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH). We can sum the total moles of acid and compare them to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles CH3COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Compare total base (0.180 mol) to total acid (0.130 mol).\n    *   Since moles of base > moles of acid, the base is in excess.\n    *   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total Base - Total Acid\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol OH⁻**\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Concentration and pH**\nThe final pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This value (1.38) is the pOH, not the pH. It is listed as option D, which is a common distractor.\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH is: pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.

We can sum the total moles of acid and compare them to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Compare the total moles of base (0.180 mol) to the total moles of acid (0.130 mol).\n    *   Since moles of base > moles of acid, the final solution will be basic due to an excess of OH⁻.\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final pH.**\n\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe calculated pH is 12.62.

Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Identify Species:** The solution contains a weak acid (CH₃COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)₂).\n*   **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** A critical point is that Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that dissociates to yield *two* hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every one formula unit. This is a common point of error if missed.\n*   **Reaction Order:** Neutralization reactions between a strong acid and a strong base are effectively instantaneous and go to completion. Therefore, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂) first. Any remaining strong base will then react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Final pH Determinant:** After all neutralization reactions are complete, the pH will be determined by the species present in excess. If a strong acid or strong base is in excess, it will be the primary determinant of the pH. The contribution from any weak acid or weak base formed will be negligible in comparison.\n*   **pOH to pH Conversion:** If excess hydroxide (OH⁻) remains, the calculation will first yield the pOH. A final, crucial step is to convert pOH to pH using the formula: pH = 14 - pOH (at 25°C). Mistaking the pOH for the pH is a frequent mistake.\n\n**2.

The contribution of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) formed is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = (Excess moles of OH⁻) / (Total Volume)\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe calculated pH is 12.62, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a systematic approach to determine the final pH of a mixed solution containing a weak acid, a strong acid, and a strong base. The correct method involves calculating the moles of all acidic and basic species, determining the excess reactant after neutralization, and then calculating the pH from the concentration of this excess species.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Moles of Acidic and Basic Species**\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that provides two OH⁻ ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Perform Neutralization**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids. It's simplest to sum the total moles of acid and compare to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺) to be neutralized:**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻) available:**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Compare the total moles of base (0.180 mol) to the total moles of acid (0.130 mol).\n    *   Since moles of base > moles of acid, the base is in excess.\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate Final pH**\n\nThe final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻), as its effect will overwhelm that of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) that was formed.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe calculated pH is 12.62. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 8.92\nB) 8.68\nC) 12.62\nD) 1.38\n\nThe correct choice is C. The calculation is confirmed by the majority of the provided candidate answers, even though many of them selected the incorrect final letter. The python code execution also confirms the result.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the final pH of the solution, we must systematically account for all the acidic and basic species and their reactions.\n\n**1. Careful Points in the Analysis**\n\n*   **Identify Strong vs. Weak Species:** It is crucial to distinguish between strong and weak acids and bases. HCl is a strong acid (dissociates completely), CH₃COOH is a weak acid (dissociates partially), and Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base (dissociates completely).\n*   **Stoichiometry of Dissociation:** A common error is to forget that Ba(OH)₂ releases two moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every one mole of Ba(OH)₂.\n*   **Order of Neutralization:** The strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons. The reaction proceeds to completion, first with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and then with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Determining the Final pH:** The final pH is determined by the species in excess. If a strong acid or strong base is in excess, the pH calculation is straightforward. The contribution from any weak species (like the conjugate base CH₃COO⁻ in this case) is negligible compared to the excess strong base.\n*   **pOH vs. pH:** A frequent mistake is to calculate the pOH from the excess [OH⁻] and report that as the final answer, instead of converting it to pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each species:**\n    *   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n        Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol H⁺**\n    *   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n        Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol CH₃COOH**\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n        Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = **0.180 mol OH⁻**\n\n2.  **Perform neutralization reactions:**\n    *   First, the strong base neutralizes the strong acid:\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol (initial OH⁻) - 0.080 mol (H⁺ from HCl) = **0.100 mol OH⁻**\n    *   Next, the remaining strong base neutralizes the weak acid:\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol (remaining OH⁻) - 0.050 mol (CH₃COOH) = **0.050 mol OH⁻**\n\n3.  **Calculate the final concentration and pH:**\n    *   The final solution has an excess of 0.050 moles of OH⁻.\n    *   **Total volume:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n    *   **Final [OH⁻]:**\n        [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n    *   **Calculate pOH:**\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Calculate pH:**\n        pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe calculated pH is 12.62, which corresponds to option C.
