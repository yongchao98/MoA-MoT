This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The anhydride's spectroscopic data (¹H NMR: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The high degree of symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are appropriate for vinylic protons/carbons and anhydride carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is the sum of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n*   Two stereoisomers are formed: a major and a minor product. In a Diels-Alder reaction, these correspond to the **endo adduct (major, kinetic product)** and the **exo adduct (minor, thermodynamic product)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 3D Structures and Key Spatial Relationships**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We need to determine which protons are close in space in the major (*endo*) isomer but far apart in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are tucked under the diene's π-system. This results in a product where the anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. Crucially, the two protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them H_anhydride) are on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system. The C7 bridge also has protons on the *exo* face (the *anti*-proton) and the *endo* face (the *syn*-proton). Therefore, in the *endo* adduct, the **H_anhydride protons are spatially close to the C7 bridge protons**.\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons are on the *endo* face of the bicyclic system, pointing towards the C=C double bond. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons**.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A NOESY cross-peak indicates spatial proximity (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, this unique interaction in the major (*endo*) product is between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **C7 bridge protons**.\n\n**Step 5: Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Option**\n\nWe need to match the interacting protons to the signals described in the options.\n\n*   **H_anhydride:** These two equivalent protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. They are deshielded and appear as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** These are two diastereotopic protons on a saturated carbon. They couple to each other, appearing as doublets. A chemical shift in the aliphatic region is expected. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these protons.\n*   **Alkene Methyls:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond would be a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons would be a 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm.\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak unique to the major product connects the H_anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton. This corresponds to an interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the information from the provided answers and established chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—is characteristic of the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**. The chemical shifts correspond to the equivalent vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and carbonyl carbons, respectively. All candidate answers correctly identify this reactant.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Major and Minor Products\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder Endo Rule** states that the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product, meaning it forms faster and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable but slower-forming **minor product**.\n*   The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, which correspond to the *endo* and *exo* isomers, respectively.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 3D Structure of the Isomers\nThis is the most critical step and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers. It requires a precise understanding of the stereochemistry of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n\n*   **Proton Assignments:** Based on the problem description and chemical principles, we can assign the signals:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them H_anhydride). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups on the double bond (Me_alkene).\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge (H_bridge). It is a doublet due to coupling with the other bridge proton.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (Me_bridgehead).\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships (NOESY):** The NOESY experiment detects protons that are close in space. We need to find a proximity that exists in the major (*endo*) product but not the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the C7 bridge. This arrangement places the H_anhydride protons on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system. The C7 bridge has two protons: one *syn* to the double bond and one *anti* to the double bond. The *anti*-bridge proton is also on the *exo* face. Therefore, in the *endo* adduct, the **H_anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the *anti*-bridge proton (~1.5 ppm)**.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side from the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons are now on the *endo* face, far from the *anti*-bridge proton. Instead, they become close to the alkene methyl groups.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n*   The question asks for the cross-peak that is present in the **major product** but absent or weak in the minor product.\n*   Based on the correct structural analysis, this unique interaction in the major (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons.\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The molecule's symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent (one ¹H signal) and creates two sets of equivalent carbons (alkene carbons and carbonyl carbons), resulting in two ¹³C signals.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Stereochemistry**\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically favored but **minor product**.\n*   The question asks about a NOESY cross-peak present in the major product, so we must analyze the structure of the *endo* adduct.\n\n**3. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals given in the options:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\nA NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. This geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close spatial proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A NOESY cross-peak between these two is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they are brought close to the **Me_alkene** protons (~1.7 ppm).\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must therefore be the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the anhydride protons and one of the bridge protons. This corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride)\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge)\n\nThis description matches option A.\n\n```python\n# This problem requires chemical reasoning rather than direct calculation.\n# The plan is to logically deduce the answer based on the principles of stereochemistry and NMR spectroscopy.\n\n# 1.

The NMR data (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic signature for **maleic anhydride**. The high symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic for the vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and carbonyl carbons, respectively.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a highly substituted and sterically hindered diene.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   This reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Two stereoisomeric products are possible: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major Product (Stereoselectivity):**\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** states that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. In this case, the diene has four bulky methyl groups on its face. For the *endo* transition state to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a significant steric clash with these methyl groups.\n    *   The *exo* transition state, where the anhydride approaches from the more open side, avoids this steric clash.\n    *   Therefore, it is highly probable that for this specific reaction, the **exo adduct is the major product** because it is formed via a lower-energy transition state (kinetic control). The *endo* adduct would be the minor product.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structures and NOESY Data:**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor product. Based on our analysis, we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *exo* adduct but not the *endo* adduct.\n    *   **Proton Signal Assignments:**\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on the anhydride ring (H_anhydride).

In the *endo* adduct, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the newly formed double bond in the product.\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure of the Major (*endo*) Product for NOESY**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).

Identification of Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data provided (¹H: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The high degree of symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are appropriate for vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and anhydride carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Products and Stereochemistry\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces two stereoisomeric products: a major and a minor one. In the context of a cyclic diene, these are the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the major product formed under kinetic control is the *endo* adduct. This is due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n*   Therefore: **Major Product = *endo* isomer**; **Minor Product = *exo* isomer**.\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis for NOESY Spectroscopy\n*   The core of the problem is to identify a pair of protons that are close in space in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product. This spatial proximity will generate a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum.\n*   Let's visualize the product structure: a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The methyl groups from the diene are now at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C2, C3).\n    *   The protons from maleic anhydride are on the fused anhydride ring (at C5, C6). Let's call these **H_anhydride**.\n    *   The CH₂ group from the cyclopentadiene is now the C7 bridge.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the *endo* (Major) Product:** In the *endo* adduct, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is tucked \"under\" the original diene system. This places the anhydride ring on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. Consequently, the **H_anhydride** protons are brought into close spatial proximity with the methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_alkene**).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the *exo* (Minor) Product:** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring points away from the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **Me_alkene** groups.\n\n### 4. Signal Assignment and Conclusion\n*   The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must arise from the interaction between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n*   Now, we assign the signals described in the options:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the two equivalent **H_anhydride** protons, which are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_alkene**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 bridge.\n*   The key interaction in the major product is between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**. This matches the description in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The anhydride's spectroscopic data includes a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   The high degree of symmetry (one type of proton, two types of carbon) and the characteristic chemical shifts (vinylic proton at 7 ppm, vinylic carbon at 137 ppm, and anhydride carbonyl carbon at 165 ppm) unambiguously identify this compound as **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Given the cyclic nature of the diene, the product will have a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core structure.\n*   The reaction yields a major and a minor product, which correspond to the two possible stereoisomers: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product, meaning it forms faster and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically favored (more stable) but slower-forming **minor product**.\n\n**3. Analyze the 3D Structures and Proton Assignments**\n\n*   **Proton Signals:** Based on the product's structure and the options provided, we can assign the signals:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead carbons. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7). Let's call them **H_bridge**.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity in the Isomers:** The key to solving the problem is understanding the spatial arrangement of these protons in the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) isomers.\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are tucked \"under\" the diene's π-system. In the final product, this geometry places the anhydride ring on the same side as the newly formed double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** protons (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_alkene** protons. Instead, they are brought closer to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n**4. Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space.\n*   The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent or weak in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, the interaction that is unique to the major (*endo*) product is the close proximity between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_alkene** protons.\n*   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak in the major product's spectrum must connect the signals for these two groups.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak connects the resonances for the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons. Matching this to our signal assignments:\n*   The interaction is between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis corresponds directly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of the highly symmetric **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**2. Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, these correspond to the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **major product** is typically the kinetically favored ***endo*** **adduct**. The **minor product** is the thermodynamically favored ***exo*** **adduct**.\n*   **Crucial Point on Stereochemistry:** For Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes like cyclopentadiene, the *endo* position is defined as being on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the longest bridge. In this case, the longest bridge is the C7 methylene (CH₂) bridge. The *exo* position is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Major (*endo*) Product:** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Minor (*exo*) Product:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge.\n\n**3. Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   Based on the correct stereochemistry from Step 2:\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is *syn* to the C7 bridge. This brings the protons on the anhydride ring into close spatial proximity with the protons on the C7 bridge. A NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is *anti* to the C7 bridge. The protons on the anhydride ring are now far from the C7 bridge protons. The NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. (In this isomer, the anhydride protons are close to the alkene methyl groups).\n*   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak observed in the major product connects the anhydride protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n\n**4. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals and Select the Correct Option**\n\n*   We need to match the interacting protons to the signals described in the options.\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** These two equivalent protons are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, making them highly deshielded. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** These are two aliphatic protons on the methylene bridge. They are in a much more shielded environment. The signal described, a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, corresponds to one of these bridge protons (it's a doublet due to coupling with the other bridge proton).\n*   **Other Signals:** The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond. The **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak unique to the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons with one of the C7 bridge protons. This corresponds to an interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. The anhydride's spectroscopic data is:\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons (on a C=C double bond).\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. These correspond to vinylic carbons and carbonyl carbons, respectively. The presence of only two signals confirms a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   This data unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n*   The **Alder endo rule** states that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, which is formed faster (kinetic control). The minor product is the *exo* isomer. The problem confirms the formation of a major and a minor product.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and Spatial Proximity (for NOESY)**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n*   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we must find a spatial relationship that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   **Structure of the *Endo* (Major) Product:** In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride carbonyls) are positioned under the diene's π-system. This results in a product where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond. This geometry brings the protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**) very close to the methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_alkene**).\n*   **Structure of the *Exo* (Minor) Product:** In the *exo* product, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the double bond. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **Me_alkene** groups.\n*   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product must be the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n\n**4. Assign the NMR Signals**\n\n*   We need to match the proton groups to the signals described in the options. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_alkene:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_bridgehead:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are more shielded and correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons:** These are the two protons on the CH₂ bridge. They are non-equivalent and would appear as two separate signals, likely doublets. One of these corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe unique cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the anhydride protons with the alkene methyl groups. Based on the signal assignments, this is the interaction between:\n*   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (Me_alkene)\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride)\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**. The symmetry of the molecule accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic of vinylic protons/carbons and anhydride carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n**2. Determination of Products and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene adduct. The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n*   Two stereoisomers are formed: a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, this corresponds to the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder Endo Rule**, the *endo* adduct is typically the kinetically favored product and thus the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically favored product and thus the **minor product**.\n\n**3. Analysis of 3D Structures and Key Spatial Proximities**\n\nThis is the most critical step for interpreting the NOESY data. It requires a correct visualization of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the original diene system. In the resulting bicyclic product, this means the anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge. The two protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them **H_anhydride**) are on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system, pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond. The C7 bridge has two protons: one pointing towards the double bond (*syn*) and one pointing away from it (*anti*). The *anti*-C7 proton is also on the *exo* face. Therefore, in the major (*endo*) product, the **H_anhydride protons are spatially close to the *anti*-C7 proton**.\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. This places the **H_anhydride** protons on the *endo* face, pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond. In this position, they are far from the C7 bridge protons but are now **spatially close to the methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond**.\n\n**4. Interpretation of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, the interaction that is unique to the major (*endo*) product is the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the ***anti*-C7 bridge proton**. The interaction between H_anhydride and the alkene methyl groups is characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n**5. Assignment of NMR Signals and Selection of the Correct Option**\n\n*   We need to match the interacting protons to the signals described in the options.\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These are the two protons on the anhydride ring. They are equivalent by symmetry and deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   ***anti*-C7 bridge proton:** This is one of the two protons on the methylene bridge. The bridge protons are diastereotopic and couple to each other (geminal coupling), so they appear as two separate signals, each a doublet. An aliphatic proton in a strained ring system would have a chemical shift in the 1-2 ppm range. This corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Alkene methyl groups:** The methyl groups on the double bond correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** The methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n\n*   The unique NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects **H_anhydride** and the ***anti*-C7 bridge proton**. This corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The anhydride's NMR data (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**.

We can assign the signals described in the options based on their expected chemical environment, integration, and multiplicity.\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead carbons. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge. The two bridge protons are non-equivalent (diastereotopic) and couple to each other, appearing as two doublets (or an AB quartet). Let's call this one **H_bridge**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and NOESY Data:**\n    *   The core of the problem is to identify which protons are close in space in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product. This requires correctly visualizing the 3D structures.\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are tucked under the diene's π-system. This results in a final product where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the C7 bridge. This orientation places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) in close proximity to the protons on the **C7 bridge** (~1.5 ppm).\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. Here, the H_anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons. Instead, they are close to the Me_alkene groups (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must be the one that arises from the unique spatial proximity in the *endo* isomer.

Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. Two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** states that the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer, which is formed faster (kinetic product). The *exo* isomer is the minor product.\n*   Therefore: **Major Product = *endo* adduct**; **Minor Product = *exo* adduct**.\n\n**3. Analyze the 3D Structure of the Isomers**\n\nThis is the most critical step. The key is to correctly visualize the spatial arrangement of the protons in each isomer.\n\n*   In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system, the C7 carbon forms a \"bridge\". Substituents on the main six-membered ring can either be *endo* (pointing \"down,\" under the ring and towards the C=C double bond) or *exo* (pointing \"up,\" towards the C7 bridge).\n*   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the transition state leading to this product, the anhydride's electron-withdrawing groups are tucked under the diene. This results in the anhydride ring itself being in the *endo* position. Consequently, the two protons attached to the anhydride part of the backbone (at positions C5 and C6) are forced into the ***exo*** **position**. In this *exo* orientation, they are on the same side as the C7 bridge and are spatially close to the C7 bridge protons. They are far from the methyl groups on the C=C double bond.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is in the *exo* position. This forces the two anhydride protons into the ***endo*** **position**. In this *endo* orientation, they point towards the C=C double bond and are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups. They are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n**4. Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, the spatial proximity unique to the major (*endo*) product is between the **anhydride protons** and the **C7 bridge protons**.\n*   The spatial proximity unique to the minor (*exo*) product is between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl groups**.\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak described in the problem must connect the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals and Select the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** These two equivalent protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups and will be deshielded. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** These are aliphatic protons on the one-carbon bridge. They are diastereotopic and couple to each other, appearing as doublets. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** is the correct assignment for one of these protons.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups on the double bond correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n\nThe cross-peak present only in the major product connects the anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons.

Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The anhydride's NMR data (¹H: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The high degree of symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are appropriate for vinylic protons/carbons and anhydride carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**2. Determine the Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder endo rule** states that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, which is formed faster (kinetic control) due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* isomer is the minor product.\n*   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and Spatial Proximity for NOESY**\n\n*   The key to solving the problem is understanding the three-dimensional structure of the *endo* and *exo* products and what protons are close in space. A NOESY cross-peak indicates spatial proximity (< 5 Å).\n*   The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*endo*) product** but absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n*   Let's visualize the structures:\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring, placing it on the same side (*syn*) as the carbon-carbon double bond.

In this arrangement, the anhydride protons are far from the methyl groups on the double bond.\n*   Conclusion: The NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*endo*) product is the one showing an interaction between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl protons**.\n\n**4. Assign the NMR Signals**\n\n*   We need to match the interacting protons to the signals described in the options. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:** These two equivalent protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups, so they are deshielded. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Alkene Methyl Protons:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached directly to the double bond (vinylic methyls). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are more shielded and correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Bridge Protons:** These are two non-equivalent protons. One of them is described as the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\n*   The analysis shows that the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n*   These protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data (¹H NMR: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) unambiguously identifies this compound as **maleic anhydride**. The high degree of symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic for the vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n### 2. Identification of Products and Stereochemistry\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Two stereoisomers are formed: a major and a minor product.\n*   According to the **Alder Endo Rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer, which is formed faster (kinetic control). The minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n*   Therefore: **Major Product = *endo* adduct**; **Minor Product = *exo* adduct**.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Product Structure and NMR Signals\n*   The NMR signals described in the options (e.g., \"6H singlet,\" \"2H singlet\") imply that the product has a plane of symmetry. While the named diene is technically not symmetric, we will proceed, like the candidate answers, by assuming a symmetric product is formed that gives rise to the simplified signals described.\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them **H_anhydride**). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_alkene**).\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (**Me_bridgehead**).\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (**H_bridge**).\n\n### 4. The Crucial Step: 2D NOESY Analysis and 3D Structure\nThe core of the problem is to identify a pair of protons that are close in space in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product. This requires a correct visualization of the 3D structures.\n\n*   In the bicyclo[2.2.1] system, the *endo* position is on the same side as the C7 bridge, while the *exo* position is on the opposite side.\n*   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** The anhydride ring is in the *endo* position. This means the ring itself is tucked towards the C7 bridge. Consequently, the protons attached to this ring (**H_anhydride**) are in the *exo* position, pointing away from the C7 bridge. In this specific orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the *anti*-proton of the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**). They are far from the alkene methyl groups (**Me_alkene**).\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** The anhydride ring is in the *exo* position. This means the **H_anhydride** protons are in the *endo* position, pointing towards the C7 bridge and underneath the C=C double bond. In this orientation, they are now spatially close to the **Me_alkene** groups but far from the **H_bridge** protons.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe question asks for the cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one.\n\n*   Based on the analysis above, the unique spatial proximity in the major (*endo*) product is between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **H_bridge** proton.\n*   This corresponds to a NOESY cross-peak connecting the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   This matches option D.\n\nA common mistake is to incorrectly assume that in the *endo* product, the anhydride protons are close to the alkene methyls. This is only true for the *exo* product. The answers that correctly identify the stereochemistry (e.g., candidates 1, 5, 11, 15) arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the information and correcting the errors found in the candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data—¹H NMR with a single peak at 7 ppm and ¹³C NMR with two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—is a classic fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**. The high degree of symmetry explains the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic of vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and carbonyl carbons, respectively.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n### **2. Determine the Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** is a fundamental principle of this reaction, stating that the major product formed under kinetic control is the ***endo*** **adduct**. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The ***exo*** **adduct** is the minor product.\n*   Therefore, the question about the **major product** is a question about the structure of the ***endo*** **adduct**.\n\n### **3. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can assign the signals:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead carbons. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). Let's call them **H_bridge**.\n\n### **4. Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Data**\n\nThis is the most critical step and the source of most errors in the candidate answers. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å). We need to find a proximity that is unique to the major (*endo*) product.\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 methylene bridge. This geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close spatial proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they are brought close to the **Me_alkene** protons (~1.7 ppm).\n\nThe cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product** must therefore be the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the anhydride protons and one of the bridge protons. This corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride)\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge)\n\nThis description matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The anhydride's spectroscopic data (¹H NMR: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The high degree of symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are appropriate for vinylic protons/carbons and anhydride carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is the sum of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n*   Two stereoisomers are formed: a major and a minor product. In a Diels-Alder reaction, these correspond to the **endo adduct (major, kinetic product)** and the **exo adduct (minor, thermodynamic product)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 3D Structures and Key Spatial Relationships**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We need to determine which protons are close in space in the major (*endo*) isomer but far apart in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are tucked under the diene's π-system. This results in a product where the anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. Crucially, the two protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them H_anhydride) are on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system. The C7 bridge also has protons on the *exo* face (the *anti*-proton) and the *endo* face (the *syn*-proton). Therefore, in the *endo* adduct, the **H_anhydride protons are spatially close to the C7 bridge protons**.\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons are on the *endo* face of the bicyclic system, pointing towards the C=C double bond. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons**.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A NOESY cross-peak indicates spatial proximity (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, this unique interaction in the major (*endo*) product is between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **C7 bridge protons**.\n\n**Step 5: Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Option**\n\nWe need to match the interacting protons to the signals described in the options.\n\n*   **H_anhydride:** These two equivalent protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. They are deshielded and appear as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** These are two diastereotopic protons on a saturated carbon. They couple to each other, appearing as doublets. A chemical shift in the aliphatic region is expected. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these protons.\n*   **Alkene Methyls:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond would be a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons would be a 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm.\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak unique to the major product connects the H_anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton. This corresponds to an interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the information from the provided answers and established chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—is characteristic of the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**. The chemical shifts correspond to the equivalent vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and carbonyl carbons, respectively. All candidate answers correctly identify this reactant.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Major and Minor Products\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder Endo Rule** states that the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product, meaning it forms faster and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable but slower-forming **minor product**.\n*   The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, which correspond to the *endo* and *exo* isomers, respectively.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 3D Structure of the Isomers\nThis is the most critical step and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers. It requires a precise understanding of the stereochemistry of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n\n*   **Proton Assignments:** Based on the problem description and chemical principles, we can assign the signals:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them H_anhydride). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups on the double bond (Me_alkene).\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge (H_bridge). It is a doublet due to coupling with the other bridge proton.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (Me_bridgehead).\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships (NOESY):** The NOESY experiment detects protons that are close in space. We need to find a proximity that exists in the major (*endo*) product but not the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the C7 bridge. This arrangement places the H_anhydride protons on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system. The C7 bridge has two protons: one *syn* to the double bond and one *anti* to the double bond. The *anti*-bridge proton is also on the *exo* face. Therefore, in the *endo* adduct, the **H_anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the *anti*-bridge proton (~1.5 ppm)**.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side from the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons are now on the *endo* face, far from the *anti*-bridge proton. Instead, they become close to the alkene methyl groups.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n*   The question asks for the cross-peak that is present in the **major product** but absent or weak in the minor product.\n*   Based on the correct structural analysis, this unique interaction in the major (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons.\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

The NMR data (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The molecule's symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent (one ¹H signal) and creates two sets of equivalent carbons (alkene carbons and carbonyl carbons), resulting in two ¹³C signals.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Stereochemistry**\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically favored but **minor product**.\n*   The question asks about a NOESY cross-peak present in the major product, so we must analyze the structure of the *endo* adduct.\n\n**3. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals given in the options:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\nA NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å).

A NOESY cross-peak between these two is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they are brought close to the **Me_alkene** protons (~1.7 ppm).\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must therefore be the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the anhydride protons and one of the bridge protons.

This is a highly substituted and sterically hindered diene.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   This reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Two stereoisomeric products are possible: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major Product (Stereoselectivity):**\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** states that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. In this case, the diene has four bulky methyl groups on its face. For the *endo* transition state to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a significant steric clash with these methyl groups.\n    *   The *exo* transition state, where the anhydride approaches from the more open side, avoids this steric clash.\n    *   Therefore, it is highly probable that for this specific reaction, the **exo adduct is the major product** because it is formed via a lower-energy transition state (kinetic control). The *endo* adduct would be the minor product.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structures and NOESY Data:**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor product.

The anhydride's spectroscopic data is:\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    The high degree of symmetry (one type of proton, two types of carbon) and the characteristic chemical shifts (vinylic proton, vinylic carbon, and carbonyl carbon) unambiguously identify this compound as **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and its Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. In a Diels-Alder reaction under kinetic control, these correspond to the ***endo*** and ***exo*** stereoisomers.\n*   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the major product is the *endo* isomer, which is formed faster due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n*   **Major Product = *Endo* isomer**\n*   **Minor Product = *Exo* isomer**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 3D Structures and Spatial Proximities for NOESY**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n*   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We must therefore find a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n\n*   **Proton Signal Assignments:** Based on typical chemical shifts for this type of structure:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (H_anhydride). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The four equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (Me_alkene).\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (Me_bridgehead).\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (H_bridge).\n\n*   **Spatial Analysis:**\n    *   **In the major (*endo*) product:** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the C=C double bond. It is \"tucked under\" this double bond. This geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the **Me_alkene** groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **In the minor (*exo*) product:** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C double bond. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **Me_alkene** groups. The NOESY cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak. (Instead, in the *exo* isomer, the H_anhydride protons are close to the H_bridge protons).\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product is the one that arises from the unique spatial proximity in the *endo* isomer.

The NMR data (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of the highly symmetric **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n**2. Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. Two stereoisomers are formed: a major and a minor product.\n*   In a Diels-Alder reaction, the major product is typically the ***endo*** **adduct** (the kinetic product), and the minor product is the ***exo*** **adduct** (the thermodynamic product).\n*   The key to solving the problem is understanding the three-dimensional structure of the major (*endo*) product. In the *endo* adduct, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the newly formed double bond in the product.\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure of the Major (*endo*) Product for NOESY**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n*   The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor product. This must correspond to a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C double bond of the bicyclic system. This geometry brings the protons on the anhydride ring into close spatial proximity with the methyl groups attached to that C=C double bond.\n*   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C=C double bond. The anhydride protons are now far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n*   Therefore, the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons**.\n\n**4. Assign the NMR Signals**\n\nWe must now assign the signals described in the options to the protons in the molecule. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the two equivalent **anhydride protons**. They are deshielded because they are on carbons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the two equivalent **vinylic methyl groups** attached to the C=C double bond.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the two equivalent **bridgehead methyl groups**. They are on saturated carbons and are more shielded.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the **CH₂ bridge**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product is due to the spatial proximity of the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons. Based on the signal assignments:\n\n*   This connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (anhydride protons) with the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (vinylic methyl protons).\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data provided (¹H: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The high degree of symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are appropriate for vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and anhydride carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Products and Stereochemistry\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces two stereoisomeric products: a major and a minor one. In the context of a cyclic diene, these are the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the major product formed under kinetic control is the *endo* adduct. This is due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n*   Therefore: **Major Product = *endo* isomer**; **Minor Product = *exo* isomer**.\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis for NOESY Spectroscopy\n*   The core of the problem is to identify a pair of protons that are close in space in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product. This spatial proximity will generate a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum.\n*   Let's visualize the product structure: a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The methyl groups from the diene are now at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C2, C3).\n    *   The protons from maleic anhydride are on the fused anhydride ring (at C5, C6). Let's call these **H_anhydride**.\n    *   The CH₂ group from the cyclopentadiene is now the C7 bridge.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the *endo* (Major) Product:** In the *endo* adduct, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is tucked \"under\" the original diene system. This places the anhydride ring on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. Consequently, the **H_anhydride** protons are brought into close spatial proximity with the methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_alkene**).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the *exo* (Minor) Product:** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring points away from the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **Me_alkene** groups.\n\n### 4. Signal Assignment and Conclusion\n*   The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must arise from the interaction between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n*   Now, we assign the signals described in the options:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the two equivalent **H_anhydride** protons, which are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_alkene**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 bridge.\n*   The key interaction in the major product is between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**. This matches the description in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The anhydride's spectroscopic data includes a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   The high degree of symmetry (one type of proton, two types of carbon) and the characteristic chemical shifts (vinylic proton at 7 ppm, vinylic carbon at 137 ppm, and anhydride carbonyl carbon at 165 ppm) unambiguously identify this compound as **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Given the cyclic nature of the diene, the product will have a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core structure.\n*   The reaction yields a major and a minor product, which correspond to the two possible stereoisomers: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product, meaning it forms faster and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically favored (more stable) but slower-forming **minor product**.\n\n**3. Analyze the 3D Structures and Proton Assignments**\n\n*   **Proton Signals:** Based on the product's structure and the options provided, we can assign the signals:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead carbons. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7). Let's call them **H_bridge**.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity in the Isomers:** The key to solving the problem is understanding the spatial arrangement of these protons in the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) isomers.\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are tucked \"under\" the diene's π-system. In the final product, this geometry places the anhydride ring on the same side as the newly formed double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** protons (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_alkene** protons. Instead, they are brought closer to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n**4. Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space.\n*   The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent or weak in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, the interaction that is unique to the major (*endo*) product is the close proximity between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_alkene** protons.\n*   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak in the major product's spectrum must connect the signals for these two groups.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak connects the resonances for the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons. Matching this to our signal assignments:\n*   The interaction is between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis corresponds directly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, these correspond to the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **major product** is typically the kinetically favored ***endo*** **adduct**. The **minor product** is the thermodynamically favored ***exo*** **adduct**.\n*   **Crucial Point on Stereochemistry:** For Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes like cyclopentadiene, the *endo* position is defined as being on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the longest bridge. In this case, the longest bridge is the C7 methylene (CH₂) bridge. The *exo* position is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Major (*endo*) Product:** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Minor (*exo*) Product:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge.\n\n**3. Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   Based on the correct stereochemistry from Step 2:\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is *syn* to the C7 bridge. This brings the protons on the anhydride ring into close spatial proximity with the protons on the C7 bridge. A NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is *anti* to the C7 bridge. The protons on the anhydride ring are now far from the C7 bridge protons. The NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. (In this isomer, the anhydride protons are close to the alkene methyl groups).\n*   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak observed in the major product connects the anhydride protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n\n**4. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals and Select the Correct Option**\n\n*   We need to match the interacting protons to the signals described in the options.\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** These two equivalent protons are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, making them highly deshielded. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** These are two aliphatic protons on the methylene bridge. They are in a much more shielded environment. The signal described, a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, corresponds to one of these bridge protons (it's a doublet due to coupling with the other bridge proton).\n*   **Other Signals:** The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond. The **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak unique to the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons with one of the C7 bridge protons. This corresponds to an interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

The anhydride's spectroscopic data is:\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons (on a C=C double bond).\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. These correspond to vinylic carbons and carbonyl carbons, respectively. The presence of only two signals confirms a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   This data unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n*   The **Alder endo rule** states that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, which is formed faster (kinetic control). The minor product is the *exo* isomer. The problem confirms the formation of a major and a minor product.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and Spatial Proximity (for NOESY)**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n*   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we must find a spatial relationship that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   **Structure of the *Endo* (Major) Product:** In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride carbonyls) are positioned under the diene's π-system. This results in a product where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond. This geometry brings the protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**) very close to the methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_alkene**).\n*   **Structure of the *Exo* (Minor) Product:** In the *exo* product, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the double bond. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **Me_alkene** groups.\n*   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product must be the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n\n**4. Assign the NMR Signals**\n\n*   We need to match the proton groups to the signals described in the options.

This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_alkene:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_bridgehead:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are more shielded and correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons:** These are the two protons on the CH₂ bridge. They are non-equivalent and would appear as two separate signals, likely doublets. One of these corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe unique cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the anhydride protons with the alkene methyl groups. Based on the signal assignments, this is the interaction between:\n*   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (Me_alkene)\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride)\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

The NMR data (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**. The symmetry of the molecule accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic of vinylic protons/carbons and anhydride carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n**2. Determination of Products and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene adduct. The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n*   Two stereoisomers are formed: a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, this corresponds to the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder Endo Rule**, the *endo* adduct is typically the kinetically favored product and thus the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically favored product and thus the **minor product**.\n\n**3. Analysis of 3D Structures and Key Spatial Proximities**\n\nThis is the most critical step for interpreting the NOESY data. It requires a correct visualization of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the original diene system. In the resulting bicyclic product, this means the anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge. The two protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them **H_anhydride**) are on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system, pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond. The C7 bridge has two protons: one pointing towards the double bond (*syn*) and one pointing away from it (*anti*). The *anti*-C7 proton is also on the *exo* face. Therefore, in the major (*endo*) product, the **H_anhydride protons are spatially close to the *anti*-C7 proton**.\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. This places the **H_anhydride** protons on the *endo* face, pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond. In this position, they are far from the C7 bridge protons but are now **spatially close to the methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond**.\n\n**4. Interpretation of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, the interaction that is unique to the major (*endo*) product is the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the ***anti*-C7 bridge proton**. The interaction between H_anhydride and the alkene methyl groups is characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n**5. Assignment of NMR Signals and Selection of the Correct Option**\n\n*   We need to match the interacting protons to the signals described in the options.\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These are the two protons on the anhydride ring. They are equivalent by symmetry and deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   ***anti*-C7 bridge proton:** This is one of the two protons on the methylene bridge. The bridge protons are diastereotopic and couple to each other (geminal coupling), so they appear as two separate signals, each a doublet. An aliphatic proton in a strained ring system would have a chemical shift in the 1-2 ppm range. This corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Alkene methyl groups:** The methyl groups on the double bond correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** The methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n\n*   The unique NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects **H_anhydride** and the ***anti*-C7 bridge proton**. This corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid.

The high symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic of vinylic protons/carbons and anhydride carbonyl carbons.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   This reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene adduct. Two stereoisomers are possible: *endo* and *exo*.\n    *   The **Alder endo rule** states that the major product is the kinetically favored **endo adduct**. The minor product is the thermodynamically favored **exo adduct**.\n\n3.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry. We can assign the signals described in the options based on their expected chemical environment, integration, and multiplicity.\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead carbons. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge. The two bridge protons are non-equivalent (diastereotopic) and couple to each other, appearing as two doublets (or an AB quartet). Let's call this one **H_bridge**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and NOESY Data:**\n    *   The core of the problem is to identify which protons are close in space in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product. This requires correctly visualizing the 3D structures.\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are tucked under the diene's π-system. This results in a final product where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the C7 bridge. This orientation places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) in close proximity to the protons on the **C7 bridge** (~1.5 ppm).\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. Here, the H_anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons. Instead, they are close to the Me_alkene groups (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must be the one that arises from the unique spatial proximity in the *endo* isomer. This is the interaction between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **H_bridge** proton.\n\n5.  **Match to the Correct Option:**\n    *   The interaction is between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride) and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge).\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**. The symmetry of the molecule accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic of the vinylic protons and the alkene/carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n**2. Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. Two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** states that the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer, which is formed faster (kinetic product). The *exo* isomer is the minor product.\n*   Therefore: **Major Product = *endo* adduct**; **Minor Product = *exo* adduct**.\n\n**3. Analyze the 3D Structure of the Isomers**\n\nThis is the most critical step. The key is to correctly visualize the spatial arrangement of the protons in each isomer.\n\n*   In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system, the C7 carbon forms a \"bridge\". Substituents on the main six-membered ring can either be *endo* (pointing \"down,\" under the ring and towards the C=C double bond) or *exo* (pointing \"up,\" towards the C7 bridge).\n*   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the transition state leading to this product, the anhydride's electron-withdrawing groups are tucked under the diene. This results in the anhydride ring itself being in the *endo* position. Consequently, the two protons attached to the anhydride part of the backbone (at positions C5 and C6) are forced into the ***exo*** **position**. In this *exo* orientation, they are on the same side as the C7 bridge and are spatially close to the C7 bridge protons. They are far from the methyl groups on the C=C double bond.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is in the *exo* position. This forces the two anhydride protons into the ***endo*** **position**. In this *endo* orientation, they point towards the C=C double bond and are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups. They are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n**4. Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our structural analysis, the spatial proximity unique to the major (*endo*) product is between the **anhydride protons** and the **C7 bridge protons**.\n*   The spatial proximity unique to the minor (*exo*) product is between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl groups**.\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak described in the problem must connect the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals and Select the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** These two equivalent protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups and will be deshielded. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** These are aliphatic protons on the one-carbon bridge. They are diastereotopic and couple to each other, appearing as doublets. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** is the correct assignment for one of these protons.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups on the double bond correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n\nThe cross-peak present only in the major product connects the anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons. This corresponds to an interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The anhydride's NMR data (¹H: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The high degree of symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are appropriate for vinylic protons/carbons and anhydride carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**2. Determine the Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder endo rule** states that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, which is formed faster (kinetic control) due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* isomer is the minor product.\n*   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and Spatial Proximity for NOESY**\n\n*   The key to solving the problem is understanding the three-dimensional structure of the *endo* and *exo* products and what protons are close in space. A NOESY cross-peak indicates spatial proximity (< 5 Å).\n*   The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*endo*) product** but absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n*   Let's visualize the structures:\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring, placing it on the same side (*syn*) as the carbon-carbon double bond. This geometry brings the protons on the anhydride ring very close to the methyl groups attached to that double bond.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the double bond. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons are far from the methyl groups on the double bond.\n*   Conclusion: The NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*endo*) product is the one showing an interaction between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl protons**.\n\n**4. Assign the NMR Signals**\n\n*   We need to match the interacting protons to the signals described in the options. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:** These two equivalent protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups, so they are deshielded. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Alkene Methyl Protons:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached directly to the double bond (vinylic methyls). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are more shielded and correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Bridge Protons:** These are two non-equivalent protons. One of them is described as the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\n*   The analysis shows that the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n*   These protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data (¹H NMR: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) unambiguously identifies this compound as **maleic anhydride**. The high degree of symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic for the vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n### 2. Identification of Products and Stereochemistry\n*   The reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Two stereoisomers are formed: a major and a minor product.\n*   According to the **Alder Endo Rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer, which is formed faster (kinetic control). The minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n*   Therefore: **Major Product = *endo* adduct**; **Minor Product = *exo* adduct**.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Product Structure and NMR Signals\n*   The NMR signals described in the options (e.g., \"6H singlet,\" \"2H singlet\") imply that the product has a plane of symmetry. While the named diene is technically not symmetric, we will proceed, like the candidate answers, by assuming a symmetric product is formed that gives rise to the simplified signals described.\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them **H_anhydride**). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_alkene**).\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (**Me_bridgehead**).\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (**H_bridge**).\n\n### 4. The Crucial Step: 2D NOESY Analysis and 3D Structure\nThe core of the problem is to identify a pair of protons that are close in space in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product. This requires a correct visualization of the 3D structures.\n\n*   In the bicyclo[2.2.1] system, the *endo* position is on the same side as the C7 bridge, while the *exo* position is on the opposite side.\n*   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** The anhydride ring is in the *endo* position. This means the ring itself is tucked towards the C7 bridge. Consequently, the protons attached to this ring (**H_anhydride**) are in the *exo* position, pointing away from the C7 bridge. In this specific orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the *anti*-proton of the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**). They are far from the alkene methyl groups (**Me_alkene**).\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** The anhydride ring is in the *exo* position. This means the **H_anhydride** protons are in the *endo* position, pointing towards the C7 bridge and underneath the C=C double bond. In this orientation, they are now spatially close to the **Me_alkene** groups but far from the **H_bridge** protons.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe question asks for the cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one.\n\n*   Based on the analysis above, the unique spatial proximity in the major (*endo*) product is between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **H_bridge** proton.\n*   This corresponds to a NOESY cross-peak connecting the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   This matches option D.\n\nA common mistake is to incorrectly assume that in the *endo* product, the anhydride protons are close to the alkene methyls. This is only true for the *exo* product. The answers that correctly identify the stereochemistry (e.g., candidates 1, 5, 11, 15) arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
