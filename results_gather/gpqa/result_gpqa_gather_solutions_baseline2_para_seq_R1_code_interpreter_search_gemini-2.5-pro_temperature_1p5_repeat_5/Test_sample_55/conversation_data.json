This means it's a cascade decay:\n    |3,0,0> → intermediate state → |1,0,0>\n\n2.  **Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For a transition from an initial state |n, l, m> to a final state |n', l', m'>, the following rules must be satisfied:\n    *   **Parity change:** The parity of the state, given by (-1)^l, must change. This implies that Δl = l' - l must be an odd integer. For one-photon E1 transitions, this simplifies to Δl = ±1.\n    *   **Angular momentum projection:** The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1. (Δm = 0 corresponds to a π-polarized photon, and Δm = ±1 corresponds to σ±-polarized photons).\n    *   **Principal quantum number:** The change in the principal quantum number, Δn, can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), we must have E_initial > E_final, which generally means n_initial > n_final.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    *   **First transition:** from |i> = |3, 0, 0> to |int>.\n        *   l_i = 0. According to the Δl = ±1 rule, the intermediate state must have l_int = 1.\n        *   m_i = 0. According to the Δm = 0, ±1 rule, the intermediate state can have m_int = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The problem implies the cascade goes via the n=2 shell, so the intermediate states are of the form |2, 1, m_int>.\n    *   **Second transition:** from |int> = |2, 1, m_int> to |f> = |1, 0, 0>.\n        *   l_int = 1. The final state has l_f = 0. The change is Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n        *   m_f = 0. The change is Δm = 0 - m_int. For this to be allowed (Δm = 0, ±1), the initial m_int must be 0, +1, or -1. This is consistent with our finding for the first transition.\n\n    Therefore, there are three possible cascade routes, distinguished by the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate |2,1,m> state:\n    *   **Path -1:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Path 0:**  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Path +1:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In the context of branching processes, this is the branching ratio for that specific path. The probability of a cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    P(path m) = BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) × BR(|2,1,m> → |1,0,0>)\n\n    *   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sublevels |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are equally probable.\n        Let Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) be the transition rate to a specific sublevel m. Due to rotational symmetry:\n        Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Let's call this rate Γ₀.\n        The total decay rate of the |3,0,0> state is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. The only allowed E1 decay from 3s is to a 2p state (since 1p does not exist).\n        Γ_total(|3,0,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 3Γ₀\n        The branching ratio for the transition into a specific sublevel 'm' is:\n        BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) = Γ₀ / (3Γ₀) = 1/3.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for |2,1,m> → |1,0,0>**\n        Once the atom is in a state |2,1,m> (a 2p state), it will decay. The only energetically lower state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the |1,0,0> state (1s), as Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 is allowed. There are no other allowed E1 decay channels.\n        Therefore, the probability of a |2,1,m> state decaying to |1,0,0> is 1.\n        BR(|2,1,m> → |1,0,0>) = 1.\n\n    *   **Overall Probability for a Specific Path:**\n        P(path m) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Each of the three possible cascade routes has a probability of 1/3. Now we check the given options:\n    A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    B) |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    C) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 1/3. (Correct route and probability)\n    D) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step decay (a cascade) of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** The rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   Parity must change. The parity of a state is given by $(-1)^l$. Since $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, parity is automatically changed, so this rule is redundant with the $\\Delta l$ rule.\n    *   For emission, the energy of the final state must be lower than the initial state, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state(s):**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$\n        *   Initial state: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_{int} = 1$.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m_{int}$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n            *   $n_{int} < n_i = 3$. Also, we must have $n_{int} \\ge l_{int} + 1 = 1+1=2$. The only possible value for $n_{int}$ is 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Initial intermediate state: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle = |2, 1, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n        *   Final state: $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check the selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$. For this to be $0, \\pm 1$, $m_{int}$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This is consistent with the possible intermediate states we found.\n        *   The transition from any of the $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The \"probability\" of a certain transition route refers to its branching ratio. The branching ratio for a specific decay channel is the rate of that channel divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n\n    *   **First transition probability:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$\n        The rate of spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n        $W_{i \\rightarrow f} \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$.\n\n        The initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, the atom has no preferred orientation in space. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the final magnetic sublevels $|f_m\\rangle = |2,1,m\\rangle$ must be the same, regardless of the value of $m$.\n        So, the transition rates are equal:\n        $W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n\n        The state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ can only decay via E1 transition to a $|n,1,m\\rangle$ state. Since $n$ must be less than 3, the only possible destination is the $n=2$ level. Thus, the total decay rate of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the sum of the rates to these three intermediate states:\n        $W_{total} = W_{m=-1} + W_{m=0} + W_{m=1}$.\n        Since the three rates are equal, let's call them $W_m$. Then $W_{total} = 3 W_m$.\n\n        The probability (branching ratio) of decaying into a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{W_{m=0}}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_m}{3W_m} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n        Similarly, the probability of decaying into $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $1/3$, and into $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n\n    *   **Second transition probability:** $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        Once the atom is in one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$, it needs to decay further. The only state with lower energy is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition to this state is allowed by E1 selection rules. Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this transition occurring is 1 (or 100%).\n        $P(|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total probability of the cascade:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    Let's consider the route proposed in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability of this route is:\n    $P_{route} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    $P_{route} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $1/3$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $1/3$. Incorrect probability.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition. This means there is an intermediate state, and each of the two steps must obey the E1 selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay, the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   From the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$, we have $l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   For the principal quantum number $n'$, it must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second Transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   To reach the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, we have $l_{final}=0, m_{final}=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This implies $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first step.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This implies $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, also consistent.\n    *   The energy of the intermediate state must be between the initial and final states. Since $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$, we must have $E_3 < E_{n'} < E_1$, which means $1 < n' < 3$. Thus, $n'$ must be 2.\n\n    Combining these results, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means there are three possible transition routes. All options A, B, C, and D propose valid intermediate states according to the selection rules. We need to determine the probability.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of each Route**\n    The probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios of each step in the cascade.\n\n    **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric.\n    *   The decay rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$, where the square indicates a sum over the components: $|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   Because the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric, the total decay rates to each of the degenerate final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal due to rotational invariance. Let's call this rate $\\Gamma_1$.\n    *   The total decay rate from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state via E1 transition is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. The only states accessible from 3s via a single E1 transition are the $np$ states with $n<3$. The only such state is the 2p level. So, the total E1 decay rate is $\\Gamma_{tot,1} = \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,-1) + \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,0) + \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,1) = \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 = 3\\Gamma_1$.\n    *   The branching ratio (probability) for the atom to take a specific path to one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is:\n        $BR_1(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{tot,1}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_1}{3\\Gamma_1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   So, the atom has a 1/3 probability of landing in any of the three intermediate states.\n\n    **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state).\n    *   We need to find the decay channels from this state. According to the E1 selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$), a 2p state ($l=1$) can only decay to an s-state ($l=0$). The only lower-energy s-state is the 1s state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$).\n    *   Since this is the only possible decay channel for the 2p state, any atom in a 2p state will eventually decay to the 1s state with 100% probability.\n    *   Therefore, the branching ratio for this second step is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n        $BR_2(m') = 1$.\n\n    **Overall Probability**\n    The total probability for a specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,m'\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the branching ratios for each step:\n    $P(\\text{route through } m') = BR_1(m') \\times BR_2(m') = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options**\n    This result shows that all three possible routes have the same probability of 1/3.\n    *   Route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n\n    Now we check the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n    Only option D presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.

To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = m \\pm (0,1) = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options provided in the question suggest that the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is also the most probable transition.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Initial intermediate state has $l'=1$.

Allowed.\n        *   All three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Determine the possible decay routes:**\n    Based on the selection rules, there are three possible cascade routes through the $n=2$ shell:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability (branching ratio) for each route:**\n    The probability of a particular route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step. This is because the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ has only one possible decay channel via a single dipole transition (to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state), so the branching ratio for the second step is 1 for all three routes.\n\n    The branching ratio for the first step, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$, is the ratio of the partial decay rate for that specific channel to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The decay rate for a transition $|i\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    Rate$(|i\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle) \\propto \\omega^3 |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = \\omega^3 (|\\langle f|x|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|y|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|z|i\\rangle|^2)$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). In spontaneous emission from a spherically symmetric state, there is no preferred direction. Therefore, the emission populates the magnetic sublevels of the final state equally.\n\n    Let's verify this by calculation. The rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ depends on the radial integral $\\mathcal{R} = \\int R_{21}(r) r^3 R_{30}(r) dr$ and an angular part.\n    *   **Rate for $m'=0$:** The transition is $\\Delta m=0$, governed by the $z$ operator ($z=r\\cos\\theta$). The squared angular matrix element is $|\\langle Y_{1,0} | \\cos\\theta | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 = 1/3$.\n    *   **Rate for $m'=\\pm 1$:** The transitions are $\\Delta m=\\pm 1$, governed by the $x$ and $y$ operators ($x \\pm iy = r\\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}$). The sum of squared angular matrix elements is $|\\langle Y_{1,\\pm 1} | x | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle Y_{1,\\pm 1} | y | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 = 1/3$.\n\n    So, the decay rates for transitions to each of the three intermediate states are equal:\n    Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle$)\n\n    Let this rate be $A_0$. The total decay rate (to the $n=2, l=1$ level) is the sum of these three rates:\n    $A_{total} = A_0 + A_0 + A_0 = 3A_0$.\n\n    The probability (branching ratio) for any one of these paths is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } m') = \\frac{\\text{Rate to } |2,1,m'\\rangle}{A_{total}} = \\frac{A_0}{3A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

(Incorrect probability, though the route is valid)\n\n    The only option that matches our derivation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom's |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state. The process is a cascade decay:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Dipole Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer (for decay, $n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n    For the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   From the options, the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is a valid decay.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow l' = 1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply Dipole Selection Rules for the Second Transition:**\n    For the second transition, $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state: $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   This confirms that all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. All routes shown in the options are physically allowed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of the Cascade:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    $P(\\text{path}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n    $P(\\text{path via } m') = \\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times \\text{BR}(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Branching Ratio for Step 1:**\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is the rate of that transition divided by the total decay rate from the initial state.\n    *   The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. This state has $l=0$ and is therefore spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the decay must proceed to each of the three magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state with equal probability.\n    *   This can be shown formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the transition rate is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $|\\langle l_i, m_i, 1, q | l_f, m_f \\rangle|^2$. For the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$, we have $l_i=0, m_i=0, l_f=1, m_f=m', q=m'$. The coefficient is $|\\langle 0,0,1,m'|1,m' \\rangle|^2 = 1$ for all $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since the rates are equal, and there are three possible channels, the probability for each is $1/3$.\n    *   So, $\\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Branching Ratio for Step 2:**\n    *   The intermediate state is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. We need to find all possible E1 decay channels from this state.\n    *   The selection rules require $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. So the final state must have $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n_{final} < 2$. The only possibility is $n_{final}=1$.\n    *   For $n=1$, the only possible value for orbital angular momentum is $l=0$.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible decay channel for the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state via a single dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n    *   Since this is the only decay path, its branching ratio is 1.\n    *   $\\text{BR}(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Probability and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   The probability for any of the three complete cascade paths is:\n        $P(\\text{path via } m') = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   This means each of the three routes is equally likely, with a probability of $1/3$.\n    *   Now, let's examine the options:\n        A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n    Option D presents one of the three valid routes and provides the correctly calculated probability of $1/3$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. It explicitly states that this occurs via \"two dipole transition\", which implies a cascade decay involving an intermediate state. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State using Selection Rules:** We apply the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions to find the allowed intermediate state(s) $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    The selection rules are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ must decrease for a decay process ($\\Delta n$ can be any integer).\n\n    *   **First Transition:** From $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Since this is a decay, $n' < n_i = 3$. Also, for a given $n'$, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, the smallest possible $n'$ is 2. So, $n'$ must be 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is true for all our possible intermediate states.\n        *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is also an allowed decay.\n    *   **Conclusion on Routes:** All three intermediate states provide a valid decay path. The three possible routes are:\n        1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        The options A, B, and D all list valid routes. To distinguish between them, we must calculate the associated probabilities.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, this is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The atom in the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has three possible decay channels to the $n=2$ level. The probability of following a specific channel is the ratio of the partial decay rate for that channel to the total decay rate.\n\n    Branching Ratio for channel $m'$ = $\\frac{\\text{Rate}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} \\text{Rate}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n\n    The spontaneous emission rate (Einstein A coefficient) is proportional to the square of the dipole transition matrix element:\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle n_f, l_f, m_f | e\\mathbf{r} | n_i, l_i, m_i \\rangle|^2$\n\n    We need to calculate this for the first transition: $|\\langle 2,1,m' | e\\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (it's an s-state, with $l=0$).\n    *   The final states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy in the non-relativistic H-atom model without external fields.\n    *   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the interaction Hamiltonian (when averaged over all directions and polarizations of the emitted photon), the transition probability is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$.\n\n    This can be shown formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element $\\langle n' l' m' | T_q^{(k)} | n l m \\rangle$ separates into a geometric part (a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) and a physical part (the reduced matrix element), which is independent of the magnetic quantum numbers.\n    For a transition from $l=0$ to $l'=1$, the squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are identical for all three possible final states $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n    Therefore, the transition rates to each of the three states are equal:\n    Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$)\n\n    Let's call this rate $R$. The total rate is $R+R+R = 3R$.\n    The branching ratio for any specific channel $m'$ is:\n    Branching Ratio = $\\frac{R}{3R} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. So the probability of the second step is 1.\n    The overall probability for a given cascade path is thus the branching ratio of the first step, which is $1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our result.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

Incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n\n    Therefore, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks for a possible decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. The notation is $|n, l, m\\rangle$, representing the principal, orbital angular momentum, and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively.\n\n### **2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions**\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules, which dictate which transitions are \"allowed\". For a transition from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the rules are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0$ or $\\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, is not restricted by a selection rule, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### **3. Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\n\nThe decay is a two-step process:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nLet's find the quantum numbers of the allowed intermediate state(s) by applying the selection rules to both steps.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l_{int} = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m_{int} = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n*   From the options provided, the intermediate principal quantum number is $n_{int}=2$. This is a valid decay since $2 < 3$.\n*   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Let's check if the transitions from our possible intermediate states are allowed:\n    *   Intermediate state candidates: $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ where $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Applying the rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$.\n            *   If $m_{int}=-1$, $\\Delta m = 1$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m_{int}=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m_{int}=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   All three intermediate states lead to an allowed transition to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Thus, there are three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability corresponding to a given route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The atom starts in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state and can decay into any of the three $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states. We need to find the relative probability of these three initial decay channels.\n\n*   The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator, $\\mathbf{d}$.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wave function is spherically symmetric. In such a case, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   The electric dipole operator has components corresponding to the three possible changes in $m$:\n    *   $d_z \\propto r \\cos\\theta$ (for $\\Delta m = 0$)\n    *   $d_x \\pm i d_y \\propto r \\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}$ (for $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$)\n*   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state, the system has no preference for emitting a photon that changes $m$ by $-1, 0,$ or $+1$. Therefore, the transition probabilities to the three degenerate final states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) must be equal.\n\n**Formal Argument (using Wigner-Eckart Theorem):**\nThe transition probability from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to $|\\langle n'l'm'|\\mathbf{d}|nlm\\rangle|^2$. According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, this matrix element can be separated into a physical part (the reduced matrix element) and a geometric part (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient).\n\nFor the first transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n$P(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | d_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2 \\cdot |\\langle 2,1 || d || 3,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nWhere $q=m'$. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$ are equal to 1 for all $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. The reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1 || d || 3,0 \\rangle$ is independent of $m'$.\nTherefore, the probabilities are equal for all three transitions:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nSince these are the only three possible intermediate states for the $n=2$ level, their probabilities must sum to 1. If there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of each one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,0\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,1\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThe second step of the cascade ($|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is guaranteed to happen once the atom is in the intermediate state, so the probability of the entire route is just the probability of the first step.\n\n### **5.

In this decay process, n decreases.\n\n2.  **Determine the First Transition Step:**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0>.\n    *   For the first transition, we apply the selection rules:\n        *   Δl = ±1: Since the initial l=0, the orbital quantum number of the intermediate state must be l'=1.\n        *   Δn < 0: The principal quantum number n must decrease. The lowest possible state with l=1 is n=2 (since l < n). So the intermediate state must have n'=2.\n        *   Δm = 0, ±1: Starting from m=0, the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', can be -1, 0, or +1.\n    *   Therefore, the first transition must be from |3,0,0> to one of the |2,1,m'> states, where m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   The problem implies the decay happens via the n=2 level as it is the only possible intermediate p-state (l=1) for a decay cascade from 3s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Transition Step:**\n    *   Intermediate state: |2,1,m'>.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0>.\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for this step:\n        *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n        *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0 - m'. To satisfy the Δm=0, ±1 rule, m' must be -1, 0, or 1, which it is.\n    *   Thus, any of the intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1> can decay to the final state |1,0,0>. The transition route must be of the form |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>. This confirms that the routes presented in options A, C, and D are all physically allowed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    We now need to find the probability of a specific cascade occurring. This is a product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step (P₁):**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> is a 3s state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external polarizing fields, there is no preferred direction of decay. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the available final m' sublevels.\n        The possible final states for the first step are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. There are three such states.\n        The 3s state can only decay via E1 to a p-state. The only energetically accessible p-state is the 2p state (|2,1,m'>). Therefore, the total probability of decay from 3s to 2p is 1. This probability is split equally among the three m' sublevels.\n        So, the probability of decaying into any specific sublevel is:\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = 1/3, for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step (P₂):**\n        The intermediate state is |2,1,m'> (a 2p state). It needs to decay to a lower energy state. According to E1 selection rules (Δl=±1), it can decay to an s-state (l=0) or a d-state (l=2). Since n must be less than 2, the only available state is the n=1 state, which requires l=0 (1s state, |1,0,0>). A 1d state does not exist.\n        Therefore, the 2p state has only one possible E1 decay channel: the 1s state.\n        This means that once the atom is in any |2,1,m'> state, it will decay to |1,0,0> with a probability of 1.\n        P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1, for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability of a specific cascade:**\n        The total probability for a specific route is P_total = P₁ * P₂.\n        Let's calculate this for the route given in option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.\n        P_total = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) * P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)\n        P_total = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}. This matches our calculation. The route is valid and the probability is correct.\n    *   B) Route is garbled, but the probability of 2/3 is incorrect for a single cascade path.\n    *   C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The route is valid, but the calculated probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n    *   D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The route is valid, but the calculated probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial and final states and the process:**\n    *   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This corresponds to the 3s orbital of the hydrogen atom.\n    *   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the ground state, the 1s orbital.\n    *   Process: The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|int\\rangle$. The path is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |int\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    The selection rules for quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$ in an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer change (for decay, $\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n3.  **Determine the possible intermediate state(s):**\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   Since it is a decay, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n        *   For a valid hydrogen atom state, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, the smallest possible value for $n'$ is 2. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n        *   A transition to $n'=1$ is not possible for the first step, because if $n'=1$, then $l'$ must be 0. This would violate the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   For the magnetic quantum number, the initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means that $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   Combining these findings, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state for this step has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n        *   The final state has $m_f=0$. Let's check the $\\Delta m$ rule for each possible intermediate state:\n            *   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$. Allowed.\n            *   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$. Allowed.\n            *   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$. Allowed.\n        *   Therefore, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. In fact, the 2p state's only allowed dipole decay channel is to the 1s state.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. Since the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ must proceed through one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability of populating a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The transition rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    We need to compare the rates of transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay process cannot have a preferred orientation for the resulting angular momentum of the atom. This physical intuition implies that the three final states $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, which are distinguished only by their orientation in space (the value of $m'$), must be populated with equal probability.\n\n    A more formal argument using the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the transition probability from an unpolarized $l=0$ state to an $l'=1$ state is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$. The matrix elements for these transitions are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$, which are all equal to 1. Thus, the transition rates are equal:\n    $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$.\n\n    Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the intermediate state, the probability for any single one is $1/3$.\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with probability 1 (since this is the only available dipole decay channel).\n    Therefore, the probability of the entire cascade following a specific route is simply the probability of the first step. For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct route and probability**)\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0>. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means there must be an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Transition Selection Rules:** For an electric dipole transition between states |n,l,m> and |n',l',m'>, the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Determine Possible Intermediate States (First Transition):**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n    *   For the first E1 transition, l must change by ±1. Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   The principal quantum number n must decrease for a decay. A common intermediate state would be n'=2. So the intermediate state is of the form |2,1,m'>.\n    *   For the magnetic quantum number m, the change Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m' must be 0, ±1.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are:\n        *   |2,1,0> (for Δm=0)\n        *   |2,1,1> (for Δm=+1)\n        *   |2,1,-1> (for Δm=-1)\n\n4.  **Verify the Second Transition:**\n    *   From each possible intermediate state |2,1,m'>, we check if a transition to the final state |1,0,0> is allowed.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n    *   Consider the transition from |2,1,m'> to |1,0,0>:\n        *   Δn = 1-2 = -1 (allowed).\n        *   Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed).\n        *   Δm = 0-m'. For this to be allowed, m' must be 0 or ±1. All three of our possible intermediate states satisfy this.\n    *   So, all three routes are possible:\n        *   Route 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 2: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 3: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios) for Each Route:**\n    The probability of a particular cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state has only one significant decay channel (which is the case here, decaying to |1,0,0>).\n    The branching ratio B(i→f) is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition Γ(i→f) to the total decay rate from the initial state, Γ_tot(i).\n    B(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) / Γ_total\n\n    The total decay rate from |3,0,0> is the sum of the rates to the three possible intermediate states:\n    Γ_total = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>)\n\n    The spontaneous emission rate Γ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, |<f|**r**|i>|².\n    Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) ∝ |<2,1,m'| **r** |3,0,0>|²\n\n    We need to calculate the relative values of these matrix elements. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the probability of populating each of the m' sublevels of the l'=1 state must be equal.\n\n    Let's verify this with a calculation. The rate is proportional to:\n    *   For m'=0: |<2,1,0|z|3,0,0>|²\n    *   For m'=1: |<2,1,1|x|3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,1|y|3,0,0>|²\n    *   For m'=-1: |<2,1,-1|x|3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,-1|y|3,0,0>|²\n\n    The calculation using spherical harmonics (as detailed in the thought process) shows that these three quantities are equal. The radial part of the integral is common to all three, and the angular part gives:\n    *   Rate(→ m'=0) ∝ (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n    *   Rate(→ m'=1) ∝ (1/6 + 1/6) × |Radial Integral|² = (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n    *   Rate(→ m'=-1) ∝ (1/6 + 1/6) × |Radial Integral|² = (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n\n    Since the rates are equal, let's call the rate for each channel Γ_0.\n    Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>) = Γ_0\n    The total rate is Γ_total = Γ_0 + Γ_0 + Γ_0 = 3Γ_0.\n\n    The branching ratio for any specific route, say via |2,1,0>, is:\n    B = Γ_0 / (3Γ_0) = 1/3.\n\n    Thus, each of the three possible routes has a probability of 1/3.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4.

Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step photon emission process, where a hydrogen atom in the $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ state decays to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The selection rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   Change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   The principal quantum number $n$ must change ($\\Delta n \\neq 0$), and for decay (emission), energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**2. Analyze the First Transition**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** Let this be $|int\\rangle = |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n\nApplying the selection rules for the first transition:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we have $l_{int} = 1$.\n*   $\\Delta n = n_{int} - n_i < 0 \\implies n_{int} < 3$. Since $l_{int}=1$, we must have $n_{int} \\geq 2$. So, the only possibility is $n_{int} = 2$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = m_{int} = 0, \\pm 1$. So, $m_{int}$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All options correctly identify one of these as part of a potential route.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Transition**\n\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n\nApplying the selection rules for the second transition from any of the possible intermediate states:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int} = -m_{int}$. For this to be allowed, we need $-m_{int}$ to be in $\\{0, \\pm 1\\}$, which is true for all possible $m_{int} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n*   $\\Delta n = n_f - n_{int} = 1-2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\nThus, all three decay routes are possible:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nThe probability of a particular decay path is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n\n*   **Branching Ratio for the first step ($B_1$)**:\n    The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a $3s$ orbital), which is spherically symmetric. When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, the emission is isotropic (the same in all directions). This means there is no preferred orientation for the final state's angular momentum. As a result, the atom has an equal probability of landing in any of the available magnetic substates of the intermediate level. Since there are three possible intermediate states ($m_{int}=-1,0,1$), the probability of transitioning to any specific one is the same.\n    $B_1 = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of $m_{int} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    (This can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the transition rate is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_i, m_i; 1, q | l_f, m_f \\rangle^2$. For the transition from $l=0$ to $l=1$, this coefficient's squared value is independent of the final $m_f$.)\n\n*   **Branching Ratio for the second step ($B_2$)**:\n    The atom is now in an intermediate state $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ (a $2p$ orbital). We need to find the probability that it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's consider what other decay channels are available from the $2p$ state. According to the dipole selection rules, the atom can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. For energy to be released, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($n<2$). The only available state that meets these criteria is the $n=1, l=0$ state (the $1s$ ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$). There is no $n=1, l=2$ state.\n    Therefore, the decay from any $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ state *must* proceed to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. There are no other competing E1 decay channels.\n    Thus, the branching ratio for the second step is 1.\n    $B_2 = P(|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n*   **Total Probability**:\n    The total probability for any of the three complete decay routes is the product of the branching ratios:\n    $P_{route} = B_1 \\times B_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

Understand the Problem:**\nThe question asks about a two-step electric dipole transition in a non-relativistic Hydrogen atom. The atom decays from the initial state `|3,0,0>` to the final state `|1,0,0>` through an intermediate state. We need to identify a valid transition route and the probability associated with that specific path. The notation used is `|n, l, m>`, where `n` is the principal quantum number, `l` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m` is the magnetic quantum number.\n\n**2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions:**\nFor a transition to be allowed under the electric dipole approximation, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be `Δl = ±1`.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, `Δn`, can be any integer (`Δn = 0, ±1, ±2, ...`).\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition Step:**\nThe atom transitions from the initial state `|i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩` to an intermediate state `|int⟩ = |n',l',m'⟩`.\n*   **Initial State:** `n=3, l=0, m=0`.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   `Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1`  implies that the intermediate state must have `l' = 1`.\n    *   `Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1` implies that the intermediate state can have `m' = -1, 0, or 1`.\n*   The options provided suggest that the intermediate state has `n' = 2`. This is an allowed change (`Δn = 2 - 3 = -1`).\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition Step:**\nThe atom transitions from the intermediate state `|int⟩ = |2,1,m'⟩` to the final state `|f⟩ = |1,0,0⟩`.\n*   **Intermediate State:** `n'=2, l'=1, m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n*   **Final State:** `n''=1, l''=0, m''=0`.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   `Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the `Δl = ±1` rule.\n    *   `Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'`. For `Δm` to be `0` or `±1`, we require `m'` to be `0` or `±1`.\n*   This confirms that all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final `|1,0,0⟩` state. All the transition routes listed in the options are physically allowed.\n\n**5. Determine the Probability of Each Route:**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, the total process branches out at the first step. The probability of following a specific path is determined by the **branching ratio** of that first decay.\n\n*   The three possible first-step transitions are:\n    1.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩`\n    2.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩`\n    3.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩`\n\n*   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment `|<final|**d**|initial>|^2`. For spontaneous emission, we consider the rates for these three channels.\n\n*   A key physical insight is required here: The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is an s-state, which is **spherically symmetric**. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Since the atom in its initial state has no preferred direction, and spontaneous emission is an isotropic process (it occurs with equal probability in all directions), there can be no preference for which of the three `m'` sublevels of the `l'=1` state is populated.\n\n*   Therefore, the probabilities of decaying into each of the three `m'` states must be equal.\n    *   `P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)`\n\n*   Since these three paths are the only possible outcomes for the first decay (to the `n=2, l=1` manifold), their probabilities must sum to 1.\n    *   `P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1`\n    *   `3 × P(any single m') = 1`\n    *   `P(any single m') = 1/3`\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options:**\nNow we compare this calculated probability with the values given in the options.\n\n*   A) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`.

The option gives `1/3`. **Correct.**\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The problem states this happens via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it is a cascade decay involving an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nA single-step transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules, as we will see below.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):** $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number (m):** $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number (n):** $\\Delta n$ can be any integer value ($\\Delta n = n' - n \\neq 0$). For a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (so $n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $E_{n'} < E_3$. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, energy only depends on $n$: $E_n = -E_R/n^2$, where $E_R$ is the Rydberg energy. $E_{n'} < E_3$ means $-E_R/n'^2 < -E_R/3^2$, which simplifies to $1/n'^2 > 1/9$, or $n'^2 < 9$. This implies $n' < 3$. So possible values for $n'$ are 1 and 2.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ (so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$).\n*   The intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ is the initial state for this transition. We found above that $l'=1$ and $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This is satisfied for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $E_{n'} > E_1$. This means $-E_R/n'^2 > -E_R/1^2$, which implies $1/n'^2 < 1$, or $n' > 1$.\n\n**Combining the conditions for n':**\nFrom the first transition, we found $n' \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\nFrom the second transition, we found $n' > 1$.\nThe only integer value that satisfies both conditions is $n' = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the intermediate state must be of the form $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$, where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n### 4. Identifying the Possible Transition Routes\nBased on the allowed intermediate states, there are three possible cascade routes:\n*   **Route 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 2:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 3:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll the routes listed in options A, C, and D are valid possible pathways according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the \"corresponding probability\". In the context of multiple decay paths, this refers to the branching ratio of the first transition. The total decay probability for the atom in the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to decay to the level $n=2$ is split among the three possible $m'$ sublevels of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state.\n\nThe transition probability from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$.\nFor the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric.\n*   Due to the rotational invariance of the electromagnetic interaction and the spherical symmetry of the initial state, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ sublevels must be the same, regardless of the value of $m'$. This is a direct consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n*   Since there are three possible and equally likely final states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n\nSo, the branching ratio for each channel is:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state with probability 1 (as this is the only allowed E1 decay channel from the 2p state). Therefore, the probability associated with each entire cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\n*   **B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The initial state is missing (typographical error), but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\nOnly option A provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two electric dipole transitions. We must follow the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:\n    *   Change in the principal quantum number, `n`: `Δn` can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), `n` decreases.\n    *   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, `l`: `Δl = ±1`.\n    *   Change in the magnetic quantum number, `m`: `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial, Intermediate, and Final States**\n    *   Initial state: `|i⟩ = |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩` (a `3s` state).\n    *   Final state: `|f⟩ = |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩` (a `1s` state).\n    *   The transition from `l=0` to `l=0` directly is forbidden because `Δl=0`. It must proceed through an intermediate state `|int⟩ = |n', l', m'⟩` in a two-step process:\n        `|3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n\n3.  **Determine the Properties of the Intermediate State**\n    *   **First Transition:** `|3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩`\n        *   `Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1`. Since `l'` must be non-negative, we must have `l' = 1`. The intermediate state must be a `p` state.\n        *   `Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m'`. The selection rule is `Δm = 0, ±1`, so `m'` can be `0, 1, -1`.\n        *   The principal quantum number `n'` must be less than 3 for a decay process. The options provided suggest `n'=2`. So the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, and `|2,1,-1⟩`. These are the `2p` orbitals.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** `|n', l', m'⟩ = |2, 1, m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        *   `Δl = l_final - l' = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the `Δl = ±1` rule.\n        *   `Δm = m_final - m' = 0 - m'`. This must be `0` or `±1`.\n        *   If `m' = 0`, then `Δm = 0`. Allowed.\n        *   If `m' = 1`, then `Δm = -1`. Allowed.\n        *   If `m' = -1`, then `Δm = 1`. Allowed.\n    *   So, all three potential intermediate states (`|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, `|2,1,-1⟩`) can decay to the final state `|1,0,0⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Branching Ratios (Probabilities)**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that path compared to all other possible paths. The overall process is the cascade `3s → 2p → 1s`. We need to find the probability of the atom taking a specific intermediate `2p` state.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`\n        The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is a `3s` state, which is spherically symmetric (`l=0`). When it decays, there is no preferred direction in space (unless an external field is applied, which is not stated). Therefore, the emission process populates the three possible final `m'` states (`m'=-1, 0, 1`) with equal probability.\n        Let `W(i→f)` be the transition rate. The rates `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩)`, `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩)`, and `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩)` are equal due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state.\n        Let the total rate of decay from `3s` to `2p` be `W_{total}`.\n        `W_{total} = W(m'=-1) + W(m'=0) + W(m'=1)`\n        Since `W(m'=-1) = W(m'=0) = W(m'=1)`, the probability (branching ratio) of transitioning to any single `m'` state is:\n        `P(3s → 2p, specific m') = W(m') / W_{total} = 1/3`.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** `|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say `|2,1,0⟩`, it will decay again. The only dipole-allowed transition to a lower energy level is to the `|1,0,0⟩` (`1s`) state. (There are no `n=1, l=0` or `n=1, l=2` states to decay to). Therefore, the probability of this second step, given that the atom is in a `2p` state, is 1.\n        `P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1` for any `m'`.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for a specific path**\n        The probability of a complete cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n        Let's take the path given in option A: `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`.\n        `P(path A) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)`\n        `P(path A) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   **A) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/3`**\n        This matches our calculation. The path is valid, and the probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\n    *   **B) `... → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `2/3`**\n        The probability is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`**\n        The path is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n\n    *   **D) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`**\n        The path is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n\nTherefore, option A provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Process:** A hydrogen atom decays from an initial state to a final state.\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s orbital).\n*   **Final State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state).\n*   **Mechanism:** The decay happens via **two** consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.

Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules**\n\nFor an E1 transition from state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the following must be true:\n*   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For spontaneous decay, energy must be released, meaning the principal quantum number `n` must decrease ($n' < n$).\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l_{int} = 1$.\n    *   Initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   For decay, $n_{int} < 3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Final state has $l=0$. The transition from the intermediate state with $l_{int}=1$ satisfies $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   For decay, the final state's energy must be lower, so $E_1 < E_{n_{int}}$. This means $n_{int} > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining constraints on `n`:** From the first step, $n_{int} < 3$. From the second, $n_{int} > 1$. The only possible integer is $n_{int}=2$.\n\n*   **Conclusion for the intermediate state:** The intermediate state must be of the form $|2, 1, m_{int}\\rangle$, where $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. This means there are three possible decay routes through the $n=2$ level. All the routes shown in the options are physically allowed by these selection rules.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific decay route is the branching ratio of the first step multiplied by the branching ratio of the second step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: ($|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n    Once the atom is in a $2p$ state ($|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$), it must decay to a lower energy state. The only state accessible via a single E1 transition is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Therefore, this transition is guaranteed to happen. The probability (branching ratio) for this step is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$)**\n    The probability for this step is the branching ratio, which is the rate of decay to one specific intermediate state divided by the total decay rate.\n    A crucial point, as identified by nearly all successful agents, is the symmetry of the initial state. The $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state has $l=0$ and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n    Because the initial state and the electromagnetic interaction (responsible for spontaneous decay) are spherically symmetric, the outcome cannot have a preferred orientation. This means the transitions to the three possible intermediate magnetic substates ($m_{int} = -1, 0, 1$) must occur with equal probability.\n    Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first decay, their probabilities must sum to 1. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any *one* specific state is **1/3**.\n\n*   **Total Probability for one cascade route:**\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5.

(Δm = 0 corresponds to a π-polarized photon, and Δm = ±1 corresponds to σ±-polarized photons).\n    *   **Principal quantum number:** The change in the principal quantum number, Δn, can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), we must have E_initial > E_final, which generally means n_initial > n_final.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    *   **First transition:** from |i> = |3, 0, 0> to |int>.\n        *   l_i = 0. According to the Δl = ±1 rule, the intermediate state must have l_int = 1.\n        *   m_i = 0. According to the Δm = 0, ±1 rule, the intermediate state can have m_int = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The problem implies the cascade goes via the n=2 shell, so the intermediate states are of the form |2, 1, m_int>.\n    *   **Second transition:** from |int> = |2, 1, m_int> to |f> = |1, 0, 0>.\n        *   l_int = 1. The final state has l_f = 0. The change is Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n        *   m_f = 0. The change is Δm = 0 - m_int. For this to be allowed (Δm = 0, ±1), the initial m_int must be 0, +1, or -1. This is consistent with our finding for the first transition.\n\n    Therefore, there are three possible cascade routes, distinguished by the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate |2,1,m> state:\n    *   **Path -1:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Path 0:**  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Path +1:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In the context of branching processes, this is the branching ratio for that specific path. The probability of a cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    P(path m) = BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) × BR(|2,1,m> → |1,0,0>)\n\n    *   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sublevels |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are equally probable.\n        Let Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) be the transition rate to a specific sublevel m. Due to rotational symmetry:\n        Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Let's call this rate Γ₀.\n        The total decay rate of the |3,0,0> state is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. The only allowed E1 decay from 3s is to a 2p state (since 1p does not exist).\n        Γ_total(|3,0,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 3Γ₀\n        The branching ratio for the transition into a specific sublevel 'm' is:\n        BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m>) = Γ₀ / (3Γ₀) = 1/3.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for |2,1,m> → |1,0,0>**\n        Once the atom is in a state |2,1,m> (a 2p state), it will decay. The only energetically lower state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the |1,0,0> state (1s), as Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 is allowed. There are no other allowed E1 decay channels.\n        Therefore, the probability of a |2,1,m> state decaying to |1,0,0> is 1.\n        BR(|2,1,m> → |1,0,0>) = 1.\n\n    *   **Overall Probability for a Specific Path:**\n        P(path m) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Each of the three possible cascade routes has a probability of 1/3. Now we check the given options:\n    A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    B) |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    C) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 1/3. (Correct route and probability)\n    D) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe only option that provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step decay (a cascade) of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** The rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   Parity must change. The parity of a state is given by $(-1)^l$. Since $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, parity is automatically changed, so this rule is redundant with the $\\Delta l$ rule.\n    *   For emission, the energy of the final state must be lower than the initial state, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state(s):**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$\n        *   Initial state: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_{int} = 1$.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m_{int}$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n            *   $n_{int} < n_i = 3$. Also, we must have $n_{int} \\ge l_{int} + 1 = 1+1=2$. The only possible value for $n_{int}$ is 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Initial intermediate state: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle = |2, 1, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n        *   Final state: $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check the selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$. For this to be $0, \\pm 1$, $m_{int}$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This is consistent with the possible intermediate states we found.\n        *   The transition from any of the $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The \"probability\" of a certain transition route refers to its branching ratio. The branching ratio for a specific decay channel is the rate of that channel divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n\n    *   **First transition probability:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$\n        The rate of spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n        $W_{i \\rightarrow f} \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$.\n\n        The initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, the atom has no preferred orientation in space. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the final magnetic sublevels $|f_m\\rangle = |2,1,m\\rangle$ must be the same, regardless of the value of $m$.\n        So, the transition rates are equal:\n        $W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n\n        The state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ can only decay via E1 transition to a $|n,1,m\\rangle$ state. Since $n$ must be less than 3, the only possible destination is the $n=2$ level. Thus, the total decay rate of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the sum of the rates to these three intermediate states:\n        $W_{total} = W_{m=-1} + W_{m=0} + W_{m=1}$.\n        Since the three rates are equal, let's call them $W_m$. Then $W_{total} = 3 W_m$.\n\n        The probability (branching ratio) of decaying into a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{W_{m=0}}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_m}{3W_m} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n        Similarly, the probability of decaying into $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $1/3$, and into $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n\n    *   **Second transition probability:** $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        Once the atom is in one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$, it needs to decay further. The only state with lower energy is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition to this state is allowed by E1 selection rules. Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this transition occurring is 1 (or 100%).\n        $P(|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total probability of the cascade:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    Let's consider the route proposed in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability of this route is:\n    $P_{route} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    $P_{route} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $1/3$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $1/3$. Incorrect probability.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition. This means there is an intermediate state, and each of the two steps must obey the E1 selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay, the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   From the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$, we have $l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   For the principal quantum number $n'$, it must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second Transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   To reach the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, we have $l_{final}=0, m_{final}=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This implies $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first step.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This implies $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, also consistent.\n    *   The energy of the intermediate state must be between the initial and final states. Since $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$, we must have $E_3 < E_{n'} < E_1$, which means $1 < n' < 3$. Thus, $n'$ must be 2.\n\n    Combining these results, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means there are three possible transition routes. All options A, B, C, and D propose valid intermediate states according to the selection rules. We need to determine the probability.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of each Route**\n    The probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios of each step in the cascade.\n\n    **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric.\n    *   The decay rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$, where the square indicates a sum over the components: $|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   Because the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric, the total decay rates to each of the degenerate final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal due to rotational invariance. Let's call this rate $\\Gamma_1$.\n    *   The total decay rate from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state via E1 transition is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. The only states accessible from 3s via a single E1 transition are the $np$ states with $n<3$. The only such state is the 2p level. So, the total E1 decay rate is $\\Gamma_{tot,1} = \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,-1) + \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,0) + \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,1) = \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 = 3\\Gamma_1$.\n    *   The branching ratio (probability) for the atom to take a specific path to one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is:\n        $BR_1(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{tot,1}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_1}{3\\Gamma_1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   So, the atom has a 1/3 probability of landing in any of the three intermediate states.\n\n    **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state).\n    *   We need to find the decay channels from this state. According to the E1 selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$), a 2p state ($l=1$) can only decay to an s-state ($l=0$). The only lower-energy s-state is the 1s state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$).\n    *   Since this is the only possible decay channel for the 2p state, any atom in a 2p state will eventually decay to the 1s state with 100% probability.\n    *   Therefore, the branching ratio for this second step is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n        $BR_2(m') = 1$.\n\n    **Overall Probability**\n    The total probability for a specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,m'\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the branching ratios for each step:\n    $P(\\text{route through } m') = BR_1(m') \\times BR_2(m') = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options**\n    This result shows that all three possible routes have the same probability of 1/3.\n    *   Route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n\n    Now we check the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n    Only option D presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there is an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    *   Change in principal quantum number $\\Delta n$: any integer.\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   Initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = m \\pm (0,1) = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options provided in the question suggest that the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is also the most probable transition.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Initial intermediate state has $l'=1$. Final state has $l=0$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n        *   For each possible $m'$, we check $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$.\n            *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n            *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n            *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n        *   All three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Determine the possible decay routes:**\n    Based on the selection rules, there are three possible cascade routes through the $n=2$ shell:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability (branching ratio) for each route:**\n    The probability of a particular route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step. This is because the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ has only one possible decay channel via a single dipole transition (to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state), so the branching ratio for the second step is 1 for all three routes.\n\n    The branching ratio for the first step, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$, is the ratio of the partial decay rate for that specific channel to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The decay rate for a transition $|i\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    Rate$(|i\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle) \\propto \\omega^3 |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = \\omega^3 (|\\langle f|x|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|y|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|z|i\\rangle|^2)$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). In spontaneous emission from a spherically symmetric state, there is no preferred direction. Therefore, the emission populates the magnetic sublevels of the final state equally.\n\n    Let's verify this by calculation. The rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ depends on the radial integral $\\mathcal{R} = \\int R_{21}(r) r^3 R_{30}(r) dr$ and an angular part.\n    *   **Rate for $m'=0$:** The transition is $\\Delta m=0$, governed by the $z$ operator ($z=r\\cos\\theta$). The squared angular matrix element is $|\\langle Y_{1,0} | \\cos\\theta | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 = 1/3$.\n    *   **Rate for $m'=\\pm 1$:** The transitions are $\\Delta m=\\pm 1$, governed by the $x$ and $y$ operators ($x \\pm iy = r\\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}$). The sum of squared angular matrix elements is $|\\langle Y_{1,\\pm 1} | x | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle Y_{1,\\pm 1} | y | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 = 1/3$.\n\n    So, the decay rates for transitions to each of the three intermediate states are equal:\n    Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle$)\n\n    Let this rate be $A_0$.

This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state. The process is a cascade decay:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Dipole Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer (for decay, $n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n    For the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   From the options, the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is a valid decay.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow l' = 1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply Dipole Selection Rules for the Second Transition:**\n    For the second transition, $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state: $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   This confirms that all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. All routes shown in the options are physically allowed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of the Cascade:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n    $P(\\text{path}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n    $P(\\text{path via } m') = \\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times \\text{BR}(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Branching Ratio for Step 1:**\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is the rate of that transition divided by the total decay rate from the initial state.\n    *   The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. This state has $l=0$ and is therefore spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the decay must proceed to each of the three magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state with equal probability.\n    *   This can be shown formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the transition rate is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $|\\langle l_i, m_i, 1, q | l_f, m_f \\rangle|^2$. For the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$, we have $l_i=0, m_i=0, l_f=1, m_f=m', q=m'$. The coefficient is $|\\langle 0,0,1,m'|1,m' \\rangle|^2 = 1$ for all $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since the rates are equal, and there are three possible channels, the probability for each is $1/3$.\n    *   So, $\\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Branching Ratio for Step 2:**\n    *   The intermediate state is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. We need to find all possible E1 decay channels from this state.\n    *   The selection rules require $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. So the final state must have $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n_{final} < 2$. The only possibility is $n_{final}=1$.\n    *   For $n=1$, the only possible value for orbital angular momentum is $l=0$.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible decay channel for the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state via a single dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n    *   Since this is the only decay path, its branching ratio is 1.\n    *   $\\text{BR}(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Probability and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   The probability for any of the three complete cascade paths is:\n        $P(\\text{path via } m') = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   This means each of the three routes is equally likely, with a probability of $1/3$.\n    *   Now, let's examine the options:\n        A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n        D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n    Option D presents one of the three valid routes and provides the correctly calculated probability of $1/3$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. It explicitly states that this occurs via \"two dipole transition\", which implies a cascade decay involving an intermediate state. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State using Selection Rules:** We apply the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions to find the allowed intermediate state(s) $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    The selection rules are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ must decrease for a decay process ($\\Delta n$ can be any integer).\n\n    *   **First Transition:** From $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Since this is a decay, $n' < n_i = 3$. Also, for a given $n'$, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, the smallest possible $n'$ is 2. So, $n'$ must be 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is true for all our possible intermediate states.\n        *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is also an allowed decay.\n    *   **Conclusion on Routes:** All three intermediate states provide a valid decay path. The three possible routes are:\n        1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        The options A, B, and D all list valid routes. To distinguish between them, we must calculate the associated probabilities.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, this is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The atom in the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has three possible decay channels to the $n=2$ level. The probability of following a specific channel is the ratio of the partial decay rate for that channel to the total decay rate.\n\n    Branching Ratio for channel $m'$ = $\\frac{\\text{Rate}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} \\text{Rate}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n\n    The spontaneous emission rate (Einstein A coefficient) is proportional to the square of the dipole transition matrix element:\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle n_f, l_f, m_f | e\\mathbf{r} | n_i, l_i, m_i \\rangle|^2$\n\n    We need to calculate this for the first transition: $|\\langle 2,1,m' | e\\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (it's an s-state, with $l=0$).\n    *   The final states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy in the non-relativistic H-atom model without external fields.\n    *   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the interaction Hamiltonian (when averaged over all directions and polarizations of the emitted photon), the transition probability is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$.\n\n    This can be shown formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element $\\langle n' l' m' | T_q^{(k)} | n l m \\rangle$ separates into a geometric part (a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) and a physical part (the reduced matrix element), which is independent of the magnetic quantum numbers.\n    For a transition from $l=0$ to $l'=1$, the squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are identical for all three possible final states $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n    Therefore, the transition rates to each of the three states are equal:\n    Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$)\n\n    Let's call this rate $R$. The total rate is $R+R+R = 3R$.\n    The branching ratio for any specific channel $m'$ is:\n    Branching Ratio = $\\frac{R}{3R} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. So the probability of the second step is 1.\n    The overall probability for a given cascade path is thus the branching ratio of the first step, which is $1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our result.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n    *   C) Malformed option, but probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n\n    Therefore, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks for a possible decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. The notation is $|n, l, m\\rangle$, representing the principal, orbital angular momentum, and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively.\n\n### **2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions**\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules, which dictate which transitions are \"allowed\". For a transition from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the rules are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0$ or $\\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, is not restricted by a selection rule, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### **3. Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\n\nThe decay is a two-step process:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nLet's find the quantum numbers of the allowed intermediate state(s) by applying the selection rules to both steps.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l_{int} = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m_{int} = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n*   From the options provided, the intermediate principal quantum number is $n_{int}=2$. This is a valid decay since $2 < 3$.\n*   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Let's check if the transitions from our possible intermediate states are allowed:\n    *   Intermediate state candidates: $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ where $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Applying the rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$.\n            *   If $m_{int}=-1$, $\\Delta m = 1$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m_{int}=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. This is allowed.\n            *   If $m_{int}=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   All three intermediate states lead to an allowed transition to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Thus, there are three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability corresponding to a given route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The atom starts in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state and can decay into any of the three $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states. We need to find the relative probability of these three initial decay channels.\n\n*   The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator, $\\mathbf{d}$.\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wave function is spherically symmetric. In such a case, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   The electric dipole operator has components corresponding to the three possible changes in $m$:\n    *   $d_z \\propto r \\cos\\theta$ (for $\\Delta m = 0$)\n    *   $d_x \\pm i d_y \\propto r \\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}$ (for $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$)\n*   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state, the system has no preference for emitting a photon that changes $m$ by $-1, 0,$ or $+1$. Therefore, the transition probabilities to the three degenerate final states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) must be equal.\n\n**Formal Argument (using Wigner-Eckart Theorem):**\nThe transition probability from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to $|\\langle n'l'm'|\\mathbf{d}|nlm\\rangle|^2$. According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, this matrix element can be separated into a physical part (the reduced matrix element) and a geometric part (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient).\n\nFor the first transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n$P(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | d_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2 \\cdot |\\langle 2,1 || d || 3,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nWhere $q=m'$. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$ are equal to 1 for all $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. The reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1 || d || 3,0 \\rangle$ is independent of $m'$.\nTherefore, the probabilities are equal for all three transitions:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nSince these are the only three possible intermediate states for the $n=2$ level, their probabilities must sum to 1. If there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of each one is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,0\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   Prob (path via $|2,1,1\\rangle$) = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThe second step of the cascade ($|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is guaranteed to happen once the atom is in the intermediate state, so the probability of the entire route is just the probability of the first step.\n\n### **5.

In this decay process, n decreases.\n\n2.  **Determine the First Transition Step:**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0>.\n    *   For the first transition, we apply the selection rules:\n        *   Δl = ±1: Since the initial l=0, the orbital quantum number of the intermediate state must be l'=1.\n        *   Δn < 0: The principal quantum number n must decrease. The lowest possible state with l=1 is n=2 (since l < n). So the intermediate state must have n'=2.\n        *   Δm = 0, ±1: Starting from m=0, the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', can be -1, 0, or +1.\n    *   Therefore, the first transition must be from |3,0,0> to one of the |2,1,m'> states, where m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   The problem implies the decay happens via the n=2 level as it is the only possible intermediate p-state (l=1) for a decay cascade from 3s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Transition Step:**\n    *   Intermediate state: |2,1,m'>.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0>.\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for this step:\n        *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n        *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0 - m'. To satisfy the Δm=0, ±1 rule, m' must be -1, 0, or 1, which it is.\n    *   Thus, any of the intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1> can decay to the final state |1,0,0>. The transition route must be of the form |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>. This confirms that the routes presented in options A, C, and D are all physically allowed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    We now need to find the probability of a specific cascade occurring. This is a product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step (P₁):**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> is a 3s state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external polarizing fields, there is no preferred direction of decay. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the available final m' sublevels.\n        The possible final states for the first step are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. There are three such states.\n        The 3s state can only decay via E1 to a p-state. The only energetically accessible p-state is the 2p state (|2,1,m'>). Therefore, the total probability of decay from 3s to 2p is 1. This probability is split equally among the three m' sublevels.\n        So, the probability of decaying into any specific sublevel is:\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = 1/3, for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step (P₂):**\n        The intermediate state is |2,1,m'> (a 2p state). It needs to decay to a lower energy state. According to E1 selection rules (Δl=±1), it can decay to an s-state (l=0) or a d-state (l=2). Since n must be less than 2, the only available state is the n=1 state, which requires l=0 (1s state, |1,0,0>). A 1d state does not exist.\n        Therefore, the 2p state has only one possible E1 decay channel: the 1s state.\n        This means that once the atom is in any |2,1,m'> state, it will decay to |1,0,0> with a probability of 1.\n        P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1, for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability of a specific cascade:**\n        The total probability for a specific route is P_total = P₁ * P₂.\n        Let's calculate this for the route given in option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.\n        P_total = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) * P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)\n        P_total = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}. This matches our calculation. The route is valid and the probability is correct.\n    *   B) Route is garbled, but the probability of 2/3 is incorrect for a single cascade path.\n    *   C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The route is valid, but the calculated probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n    *   D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The route is valid, but the calculated probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial and final states and the process:**\n    *   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This corresponds to the 3s orbital of the hydrogen atom.\n    *   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the ground state, the 1s orbital.\n    *   Process: The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|int\\rangle$. The path is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |int\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    The selection rules for quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$ in an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer change (for decay, $\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n3.  **Determine the possible intermediate state(s):**\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   Since it is a decay, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n        *   For a valid hydrogen atom state, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, the smallest possible value for $n'$ is 2. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n        *   A transition to $n'=1$ is not possible for the first step, because if $n'=1$, then $l'$ must be 0. This would violate the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   For the magnetic quantum number, the initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ means that $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   Combining these findings, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state for this step has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n        *   The final state has $m_f=0$. Let's check the $\\Delta m$ rule for each possible intermediate state:\n            *   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$. Allowed.\n            *   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$. Allowed.\n            *   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$. Allowed.\n        *   Therefore, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. In fact, the 2p state's only allowed dipole decay channel is to the 1s state.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. Since the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ must proceed through one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability of populating a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The transition rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    We need to compare the rates of transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay process cannot have a preferred orientation for the resulting angular momentum of the atom. This physical intuition implies that the three final states $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, which are distinguished only by their orientation in space (the value of $m'$), must be populated with equal probability.\n\n    A more formal argument using the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the transition probability from an unpolarized $l=0$ state to an $l'=1$ state is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$. The matrix elements for these transitions are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$, which are all equal to 1. Thus, the transition rates are equal:\n    $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$.\n\n    Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the intermediate state, the probability for any single one is $1/3$.\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with probability 1 (since this is the only available dipole decay channel).\n    Therefore, the probability of the entire cascade following a specific route is simply the probability of the first step. For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct route and probability**)\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0>. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means there must be an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Transition Selection Rules:** For an electric dipole transition between states |n,l,m> and |n',l',m'>, the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Determine Possible Intermediate States (First Transition):**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n    *   For the first E1 transition, l must change by ±1. Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   The principal quantum number n must decrease for a decay. A common intermediate state would be n'=2. So the intermediate state is of the form |2,1,m'>.\n    *   For the magnetic quantum number m, the change Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m' must be 0, ±1.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are:\n        *   |2,1,0> (for Δm=0)\n        *   |2,1,1> (for Δm=+1)\n        *   |2,1,-1> (for Δm=-1)\n\n4.  **Verify the Second Transition:**\n    *   From each possible intermediate state |2,1,m'>, we check if a transition to the final state |1,0,0> is allowed.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n    *   Consider the transition from |2,1,m'> to |1,0,0>:\n        *   Δn = 1-2 = -1 (allowed).\n        *   Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed).\n        *   Δm = 0-m'. For this to be allowed, m' must be 0 or ±1. All three of our possible intermediate states satisfy this.\n    *   So, all three routes are possible:\n        *   Route 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 2: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Route 3: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios) for Each Route:**\n    The probability of a particular cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state has only one significant decay channel (which is the case here, decaying to |1,0,0>).\n    The branching ratio B(i→f) is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition Γ(i→f) to the total decay rate from the initial state, Γ_tot(i).\n    B(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) / Γ_total\n\n    The total decay rate from |3,0,0> is the sum of the rates to the three possible intermediate states:\n    Γ_total = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>)\n\n    The spontaneous emission rate Γ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, |<f|**r**|i>|².\n    Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) ∝ |<2,1,m'| **r** |3,0,0>|²\n\n    We need to calculate the relative values of these matrix elements. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the probability of populating each of the m' sublevels of the l'=1 state must be equal.\n\n    Let's verify this with a calculation. The rate is proportional to:\n    *   For m'=0: |<2,1,0|z|3,0,0>|²\n    *   For m'=1: |<2,1,1|x|3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,1|y|3,0,0>|²\n    *   For m'=-1: |<2,1,-1|x|3,0,0>|² + |<2,1,-1|y|3,0,0>|²\n\n    The calculation using spherical harmonics (as detailed in the thought process) shows that these three quantities are equal. The radial part of the integral is common to all three, and the angular part gives:\n    *   Rate(→ m'=0) ∝ (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n    *   Rate(→ m'=1) ∝ (1/6 + 1/6) × |Radial Integral|² = (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n    *   Rate(→ m'=-1) ∝ (1/6 + 1/6) × |Radial Integral|² = (1/3) × |Radial Integral|²\n\n    Since the rates are equal, let's call the rate for each channel Γ_0.\n    Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>) = Γ_0\n    The total rate is Γ_total = Γ_0 + Γ_0 + Γ_0 = 3Γ_0.\n\n    The branching ratio for any specific route, say via |2,1,0>, is:\n    B = Γ_0 / (3Γ_0) = 1/3.\n\n    Thus, each of the three possible routes has a probability of 1/3.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4.

Incorrect probability.\n    *   D) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. Incorrect probability.\n\n    The only correct option is B.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step photon emission process, where a hydrogen atom in the $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ state decays to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The selection rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   Change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   The principal quantum number $n$ must change ($\\Delta n \\neq 0$), and for decay (emission), energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**2. Analyze the First Transition**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** Let this be $|int\\rangle = |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n\nApplying the selection rules for the first transition:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we have $l_{int} = 1$.\n*   $\\Delta n = n_{int} - n_i < 0 \\implies n_{int} < 3$. Since $l_{int}=1$, we must have $n_{int} \\geq 2$. So, the only possibility is $n_{int} = 2$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = m_{int} = 0, \\pm 1$. So, $m_{int}$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All options correctly identify one of these as part of a potential route.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Transition**\n\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n\nApplying the selection rules for the second transition from any of the possible intermediate states:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int} = -m_{int}$. For this to be allowed, we need $-m_{int}$ to be in $\\{0, \\pm 1\\}$, which is true for all possible $m_{int} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n*   $\\Delta n = n_f - n_{int} = 1-2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\nThus, all three decay routes are possible:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nThe probability of a particular decay path is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n\n*   **Branching Ratio for the first step ($B_1$)**:\n    The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a $3s$ orbital), which is spherically symmetric. When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, the emission is isotropic (the same in all directions). This means there is no preferred orientation for the final state's angular momentum. As a result, the atom has an equal probability of landing in any of the available magnetic substates of the intermediate level. Since there are three possible intermediate states ($m_{int}=-1,0,1$), the probability of transitioning to any specific one is the same.\n    $B_1 = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of $m_{int} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    (This can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the transition rate is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_i, m_i; 1, q | l_f, m_f \\rangle^2$. For the transition from $l=0$ to $l=1$, this coefficient's squared value is independent of the final $m_f$.)\n\n*   **Branching Ratio for the second step ($B_2$)**:\n    The atom is now in an intermediate state $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ (a $2p$ orbital). We need to find the probability that it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's consider what other decay channels are available from the $2p$ state. According to the dipole selection rules, the atom can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. For energy to be released, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($n<2$). The only available state that meets these criteria is the $n=1, l=0$ state (the $1s$ ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$). There is no $n=1, l=2$ state.\n    Therefore, the decay from any $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ state *must* proceed to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. There are no other competing E1 decay channels.\n    Thus, the branching ratio for the second step is 1.\n    $B_2 = P(|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n*   **Total Probability**:\n    The total probability for any of the three complete decay routes is the product of the branching ratios:\n    $P_{route} = B_1 \\times B_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with its correct corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nThe question asks about a two-step electric dipole transition in a non-relativistic Hydrogen atom. The atom decays from the initial state `|3,0,0>` to the final state `|1,0,0>` through an intermediate state. We need to identify a valid transition route and the probability associated with that specific path. The notation used is `|n, l, m>`, where `n` is the principal quantum number, `l` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m` is the magnetic quantum number.\n\n**2. Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions:**\nFor a transition to be allowed under the electric dipole approximation, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be `Δl = ±1`.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, `Δn`, can be any integer (`Δn = 0, ±1, ±2, ...`).\n\n**3. Analyze the First Transition Step:**\nThe atom transitions from the initial state `|i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩` to an intermediate state `|int⟩ = |n',l',m'⟩`.\n*   **Initial State:** `n=3, l=0, m=0`.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   `Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1`  implies that the intermediate state must have `l' = 1`.\n    *   `Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1` implies that the intermediate state can have `m' = -1, 0, or 1`.\n*   The options provided suggest that the intermediate state has `n' = 2`. This is an allowed change (`Δn = 2 - 3 = -1`).\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Transition Step:**\nThe atom transitions from the intermediate state `|int⟩ = |2,1,m'⟩` to the final state `|f⟩ = |1,0,0⟩`.\n*   **Intermediate State:** `n'=2, l'=1, m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n*   **Final State:** `n''=1, l''=0, m''=0`.\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   `Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the `Δl = ±1` rule.\n    *   `Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'`. For `Δm` to be `0` or `±1`, we require `m'` to be `0` or `±1`.\n*   This confirms that all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final `|1,0,0⟩` state. All the transition routes listed in the options are physically allowed.\n\n**5. Determine the Probability of Each Route:**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, the total process branches out at the first step. The probability of following a specific path is determined by the **branching ratio** of that first decay.\n\n*   The three possible first-step transitions are:\n    1.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩`\n    2.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩`\n    3.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩`\n\n*   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment `|<final|**d**|initial>|^2`. For spontaneous emission, we consider the rates for these three channels.\n\n*   A key physical insight is required here: The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is an s-state, which is **spherically symmetric**. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Since the atom in its initial state has no preferred direction, and spontaneous emission is an isotropic process (it occurs with equal probability in all directions), there can be no preference for which of the three `m'` sublevels of the `l'=1` state is populated.\n\n*   Therefore, the probabilities of decaying into each of the three `m'` states must be equal.\n    *   `P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)`\n\n*   Since these three paths are the only possible outcomes for the first decay (to the `n=2, l=1` manifold), their probabilities must sum to 1.\n    *   `P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1`\n    *   `3 × P(any single m') = 1`\n    *   `P(any single m') = 1/3`\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options:**\nNow we compare this calculated probability with the values given in the options.\n\n*   A) Route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`. The probability for this route is `1/3`.

Understanding the Process\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The problem states this happens via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it is a cascade decay involving an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nA single-step transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules, as we will see below.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nFor an electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):** $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number (m):** $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number (n):** $\\Delta n$ can be any integer value ($\\Delta n = n' - n \\neq 0$). For a decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (so $n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $E_{n'} < E_3$. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, energy only depends on $n$: $E_n = -E_R/n^2$, where $E_R$ is the Rydberg energy. $E_{n'} < E_3$ means $-E_R/n'^2 < -E_R/3^2$, which simplifies to $1/n'^2 > 1/9$, or $n'^2 < 9$. This implies $n' < 3$. So possible values for $n'$ are 1 and 2.\n\n**Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ (so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$).\n*   The intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ is the initial state for this transition. We found above that $l'=1$ and $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This is satisfied for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $E_{n'} > E_1$. This means $-E_R/n'^2 > -E_R/1^2$, which implies $1/n'^2 < 1$, or $n' > 1$.\n\n**Combining the conditions for n':**\nFrom the first transition, we found $n' \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\nFrom the second transition, we found $n' > 1$.\nThe only integer value that satisfies both conditions is $n' = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the intermediate state must be of the form $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$, where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n### 4. Identifying the Possible Transition Routes\nBased on the allowed intermediate states, there are three possible cascade routes:\n*   **Route 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 2:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Route 3:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll the routes listed in options A, C, and D are valid possible pathways according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the \"corresponding probability\". In the context of multiple decay paths, this refers to the branching ratio of the first transition. The total decay probability for the atom in the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to decay to the level $n=2$ is split among the three possible $m'$ sublevels of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state.\n\nThe transition probability from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$.\nFor the first transition, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric.\n*   Due to the rotational invariance of the electromagnetic interaction and the spherical symmetry of the initial state, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ sublevels must be the same, regardless of the value of $m'$. This is a direct consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n*   Since there are three possible and equally likely final states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them.\n\nSo, the branching ratio for each channel is:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state with probability 1 (as this is the only allowed E1 decay channel from the 2p state). Therefore, the probability associated with each entire cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\n*   **B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The initial state is missing (typographical error), but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid.\n    *   The probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\nOnly option A provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two electric dipole transitions. We must follow the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:\n    *   Change in the principal quantum number, `n`: `Δn` can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), `n` decreases.\n    *   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, `l`: `Δl = ±1`.\n    *   Change in the magnetic quantum number, `m`: `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial, Intermediate, and Final States**\n    *   Initial state: `|i⟩ = |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩` (a `3s` state).\n    *   Final state: `|f⟩ = |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩` (a `1s` state).\n    *   The transition from `l=0` to `l=0` directly is forbidden because `Δl=0`. It must proceed through an intermediate state `|int⟩ = |n', l', m'⟩` in a two-step process:\n        `|3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n\n3.  **Determine the Properties of the Intermediate State**\n    *   **First Transition:** `|3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩`\n        *   `Δl = l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1`. Since `l'` must be non-negative, we must have `l' = 1`. The intermediate state must be a `p` state.\n        *   `Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m'`. The selection rule is `Δm = 0, ±1`, so `m'` can be `0, 1, -1`.\n        *   The principal quantum number `n'` must be less than 3 for a decay process. The options provided suggest `n'=2`. So the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, and `|2,1,-1⟩`. These are the `2p` orbitals.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** `|n', l', m'⟩ = |2, 1, m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        *   `Δl = l_final - l' = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the `Δl = ±1` rule.\n        *   `Δm = m_final - m' = 0 - m'`. This must be `0` or `±1`.\n        *   If `m' = 0`, then `Δm = 0`. Allowed.\n        *   If `m' = 1`, then `Δm = -1`. Allowed.\n        *   If `m' = -1`, then `Δm = 1`. Allowed.\n    *   So, all three potential intermediate states (`|2,1,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩`, `|2,1,-1⟩`) can decay to the final state `|1,0,0⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Branching Ratios (Probabilities)**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that path compared to all other possible paths. The overall process is the cascade `3s → 2p → 1s`. We need to find the probability of the atom taking a specific intermediate `2p` state.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`\n        The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is a `3s` state, which is spherically symmetric (`l=0`). When it decays, there is no preferred direction in space (unless an external field is applied, which is not stated). Therefore, the emission process populates the three possible final `m'` states (`m'=-1, 0, 1`) with equal probability.\n        Let `W(i→f)` be the transition rate. The rates `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩)`, `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩)`, and `W(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩)` are equal due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state.\n        Let the total rate of decay from `3s` to `2p` be `W_{total}`.\n        `W_{total} = W(m'=-1) + W(m'=0) + W(m'=1)`\n        Since `W(m'=-1) = W(m'=0) = W(m'=1)`, the probability (branching ratio) of transitioning to any single `m'` state is:\n        `P(3s → 2p, specific m') = W(m') / W_{total} = 1/3`.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** `|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n        Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say `|2,1,0⟩`, it will decay again. The only dipole-allowed transition to a lower energy level is to the `|1,0,0⟩` (`1s`) state. (There are no `n=1, l=0` or `n=1, l=2` states to decay to). Therefore, the probability of this second step, given that the atom is in a `2p` state, is 1.\n        `P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1` for any `m'`.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for a specific path**\n        The probability of a complete cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n        Let's take the path given in option A: `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`.\n        `P(path A) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)`\n        `P(path A) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   **A) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/3`**\n        This matches our calculation. The path is valid, and the probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\n    *   **B) `... → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `2/3`**\n        The probability is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`**\n        The path is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n\n    *   **D) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`**\n        The path is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n\nTherefore, option A provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
