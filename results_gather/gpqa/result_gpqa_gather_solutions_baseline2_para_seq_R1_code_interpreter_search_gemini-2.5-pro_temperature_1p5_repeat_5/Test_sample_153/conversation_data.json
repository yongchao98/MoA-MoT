Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a second peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern, with a ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1), is a distinctive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance), which results in this characteristic peak ratio.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that strongly indicates the presence of an O-H bond involved in hydrogen bonding. The extreme broadness is the hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **D) Phenyl chloroformate**, which is an ester and would lack the broad O-H peak.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is a singlet (s) integrating to one proton (1H). Its chemical shift is far downfield, which is highly characteristic of an acidic proton from a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   They are both doublets (d), meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   They each integrate to two protons (2H), for a total of four aromatic protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic indicator of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted)** benzene ring. This substitution pattern creates a high degree of symmetry, where the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two on the other side.\n\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, which would produce a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with three distinct aromatic signals, not two doublets. It also lacks a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl), which matches the MS data.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data.\n    *   **Substitution:** It has a para- (1,4-) substitution pattern, which perfectly explains the ¹H NMR signals (two doublets of 2H each). The carboxylic acid proton explains the singlet at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho- (1,2-) disubstituted ring. This would result in four unique aromatic protons and a much more complex ¹H NMR splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester, not a carboxylic acid, and is inconsistent with the IR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound, using the most common isotopes, is 156 g/mol.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. Its intensity is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a distinctive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formula of the options. All proposed structures (A, B, C, D) are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Nominal Mass Calculation: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   This confirms that all options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, such as a carboxylic acid attached to a benzene ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid derivative without an O-H group) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenol O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but the O-H peak is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We see two signals in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm): 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (like -COOH and -Cl), there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are identical, and they couple with their neighbors, creating a doublet. The same applies to the other pair of protons.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The aromatic substitution pattern is *para*.\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted. It would show a more complex pattern for its 4 distinct aromatic protons.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed \"two doublets of 2H each\" signal. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the -Cl atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the spectral data, we can confidently identify the compound.\n*   MS shows a molecule with formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   IR identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and establishes a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nThe only option that fits all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The intensity ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which is very close to 3:1. This pattern is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight using the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl) is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. The molecular weight using the ³⁷Cl isotope is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158. All four options have this formula, so the MS data is consistent with any of them.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence allows us to eliminate option B (an aldehyde and a phenol) and option C (a chloroformate, which is an acid chloride derivative and would lack the broad O-H peak). We are left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region, at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm.\n        *   The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), which is consistent with a disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n        *   The splitting pattern is crucial. We see two doublets. This symmetric pattern is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. Each set splits the other into a doublet.\n        *   Option A, **4-chlorobenzoic acid**, is a 1,4-disubstituted ring and would produce this exact two-doublet pattern. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be at 7.72 ppm.\n        *   Option D, **2-chlorobenzoic acid**, is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) ring. This structure lacks the symmetry of the para isomer. It would have four chemically distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four different multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the combined evidence, the only structure that fits all the spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and presence of chlorine. The IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most importantly, the para substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires integrating information from multiple spectroscopic techniques. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the data provided.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak, has a relative abundance of about 32% (100% for 156, 32% for 158). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive signature for the presence of a single **chlorine atom** in the molecule. (Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of ~75% and ~25%, respectively).\n\nSo, we are looking for a chlorine-containing compound with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl). My calculation confirmed all four options have the correct molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) and molecular weight to match the mass spectrometry data. Therefore, we must rely on the other spectra to distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\nThis IR evidence strongly suggests the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options A (an aldehyde/phenol) and C (a chloroformate), which would not show the broad O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. We are now left with options B and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (highly deshielded) is typical for an acidic proton. A chemical shift around 10-13 ppm is classic for a **carboxylic acid proton**. The 's' indicates it's a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with), and '1H' means it corresponds to one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The key information here is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each integrating to two protons (2H). Each signal is a doublet ('d'), meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   This symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. In such a ring, there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent.\n\nLet's examine the remaining options:\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly the symmetrical pattern observed: two doublets, each for 2H.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2- (ortho) substituted benzene ring. This structure is not symmetrical and would have four unique aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern (likely four distinct multiplets), not two clean doublets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the spectral data:\n*   **MS** tells us the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **IR** identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals a 1,4-disubstituted (para) aromatic ring structure.\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a strong indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed structures, assuming one chlorine atom. The formula for all options A, B, C, and D is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight (using ³⁵Cl) = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + (1 * 35.45) + (2 * 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. The integer mass is 156.\n    *   Molecular Weight (using ³⁷Cl) = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + (1 * 37.45) + (2 * 16.00) ≈ 158.5 g/mol. The integer mass is 158.\n    *   All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is right in the range for a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (typically 1710-1680 cm⁻¹).\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This rules out option A (aldehyde/phenol) and option D (chloroformate), as they would not have the characteristic broad O-H peak of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (highly deshielded) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (due to rapid exchange and no adjacent protons) confirms this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a *para*- (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the ring makes the two protons on one side equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n        *   This pattern eliminates 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B), which is *ortho*-disubstituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern with four unique aromatic protons.\n        *   This pattern perfectly matches 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C). The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom are at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   The MS data indicates a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n    *   The IR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid proton and indicates a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C) is consistent with all three pieces of spectral data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of chlorine, ³⁵Cl.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the same chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This evidence rules out Phenyl chloroformate (A), which is an acid chloride, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D), which is an aldehyde and a phenol. Phenolic -OH peaks are typically broad but usually don't extend as low as 2700 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ = 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is definitively a proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This further confirms the IR analysis and rules out options A and D. The signal is a singlet because carboxylic acid protons are acidic and typically do not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange.\n    *   **δ = 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and δ = 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H). This highly symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals.\n    *   Comparing the remaining options, 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B) has an *ortho* substitution pattern, which would result in four distinct aromatic proton signals with more complex splitting (not two simple doublets).\n    *   4-chlorobenzoic acid (C) has a *para* substitution pattern. This perfectly matches the observed NMR data, giving two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom. The IR and ¹H NMR confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The ¹H NMR aromatic region pattern confirms a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher than the molecular ion peak, is called the M+2 peak. The relative intensity of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This specific 3:1 ratio is a tell-tale sign for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule, as chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (approx. 75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (approx. 25% abundance).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (containing ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position, coupled with the O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. The conjugation with an aromatic ring slightly lowers the frequency to this range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. It is a singlet because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with and often exchanges too rapidly to show coupling. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4 aromatic protons. This means the benzene ring is disubstituted.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of **1,4-disubstitution (para-substitution)** on a benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to the two on the other, giving two signals. They appear as doublets because each proton is split by its single ortho neighbor.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesis and Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **From the data:** We are looking for a para-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a benzoic acid (has -COOH) with a chlorine atom at the para (4) position.\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of 156 for the ³⁵Cl isotope. (Correct)\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. (Correct)\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a -COOH proton and a para-disubstituted ring, which would give two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. (Correct)\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is ortho-substituted. The ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two doublets. (Incorrect)\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the -COOH proton at ~11 ppm and would not show the very broad IR stretch from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. (Incorrect)\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloroformate. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group, so it would not have the IR peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11 ppm. (Incorrect)\n\nThe only structure that perfectly matches all pieces of spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotope of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is another peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). The ratio of the intensities of the M⁺ to M⁺+2 peaks is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine (Cl) atom, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%) isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (11.0 ppm):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** The signal corresponds to one proton.\n    *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** Carboxylic acid protons are acidic and typically exchange rapidly, so they do not show coupling to adjacent protons, appearing as a singlet.\n    *   This signal confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region:** Both signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic sign of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution creates two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (at 8.02 ppm).\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   Each set of protons is split into a doublet by its neighbors.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring in a *para* (1,4) arrangement.\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\nThe evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points to a single structure:\n*   From MS: MW = 156, contains one Cl.\n*   From IR & ¹H NMR: Contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR: The -COOH and -Cl groups are in a *para* arrangement on a benzene ring.\n\nThis structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group required by the IR and the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Correct. The molecular weight (C₇H₅ClO₂ gives MW=156 for ³⁵Cl), functional groups (carboxylic acid), and substitution pattern (*para*) all perfectly match the provided data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. While it has the correct formula and functional groups, its *ortho* substitution would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic signals, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\nThe most reasonable structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound based on its most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the molecular ion peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options, using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl):\n        *   All four options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   The M+2 peak would be from the ³⁷Cl isotope: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 158 g/mol.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. This eliminates none of the options, but confirms the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This value is typical for an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This strongly supports options A and D, and rules out options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride/ester which lacks the O-H group) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde/phenol, which would have a different C=O stretch and a phenolic O-H stretch, not the very broad carboxylic acid O-H).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The singlet multiplicity is also expected. This further supports options A and D.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region is crucial. Having only two signals, both of which are doublets and integrate to 2 protons each, indicates a highly symmetric, para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring's axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two on the other side.\n        *   **Structure A (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly this pattern: two doublets, each representing 2 protons.\n        *   **Structure D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. All four aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments relative to the two different substituents. This would result in a more complex pattern, likely with four separate signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H. It would not produce two doublets of 2H each.\n\n*   **Final Synthesis:**\n    *   The MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine.\n    *   The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The aromatic region of the NMR (two doublets of 2H each) confirms a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (A) fits all of these spectral data points.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires combining information from multiple spectroscopic techniques. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue is 156 g/mol.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   There is a very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimerization.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This immediately makes options B (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates, while ruling out A (phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and D (3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Peak at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-CO**O**H). The integration confirms it is a single proton (1H). It is a singlet because acidic protons typically do not couple with other protons. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Peaks in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm):** There are two distinct signals.\n        *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** A signal for two equivalent aromatic protons. The doublet multiplicity means they are coupled to one neighboring proton.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** A signal for two other equivalent aromatic protons. The doublet multiplicity also indicates they are coupled to one neighboring proton.\n    *   This pattern—two doublets, each integrating to two protons—is a classic signature for a *para*- (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the ring makes the two protons on one side equivalent to the two protons on the other.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Ruled out by IR and NMR (no carboxylic acid).\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid, consistent with IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. This lack of symmetry means there would be four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid.\n        *   **MS:** Molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. Let's calculate the MW: (7*12) + (5*1) + 35 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches. It contains Cl, also a match.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. This matches.\n        *   **NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm). It has a *para*-disubstituted ring, which would produce the observed symmetrical pattern of two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm). This is a perfect match for all the data.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Ruled out by IR and NMR (it's an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the aromatic NMR pattern would be different).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak), which is about one-third (32%) the intensity of the M+ peak.\n    *   This characteristic M:M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale sign for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ~75.8% for ³⁵Cl and ~24.2% for ³⁷Cl).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options for the ³⁵Cl isotope:\n        *   All options (2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, Phenyl chloroformate) have the same molecular formula: C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   The molecular weight is calculated as: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   For the ³⁷Cl isotope, the weight would be 158 g/mol.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak stretching from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, where the broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) group stretch. This value falls squarely in the range for the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid (typically 1710-1680 cm⁻¹), often slightly higher due to conjugation or electron-withdrawing substituents.\n    *   Based on these two key peaks, the compound must be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This allows us to eliminate option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is a phenol and an aldehyde. While it has an O-H and C=O group, the O-H stretch of a phenol is typically less broad (~3600-3200 cm⁻¹), and the very broad peak down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is the classic sign of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   We can also eliminate option D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an acid chloride/ester hybrid. It has a C=O bond but no O-H group, so it would not show the broad peak in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ region.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is a carboxylic acid, narrowing the choices down to A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is in the far downfield region, which is characteristic of the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms one such proton. This is consistent with both remaining options A and B.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are key to determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. We see two distinct signals:\n        *   8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n        *   7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n    *   This pattern, two doublets each integrating to two protons, indicates a highly symmetric, 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent to each other.\n    *   Let's examine the remaining structures:\n        *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). It has no such plane of symmetry. All four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments and would give rise to a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals. This does not match the data.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,4-disubstituted (para). It possesses the required symmetry. The two protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to the -COOH group) are equivalent. The two protons at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to the -Cl group) are equivalent. This structure would produce exactly two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. The protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm). This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The MS data indicates a formula of C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   The IR data identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data establishes a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   Combining all the evidence, the only structure that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes. So, the molecular mass is 156 u.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 with an abundance of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a hallmark signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. The two major isotopes of chlorine are ³⁵Cl (~75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2% abundance). The molecule containing ³⁵Cl has a mass of 156 u, and the one containing ³⁷Cl has a mass of 158 u. The ratio of their abundances (~76:24) is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 u and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The wide range is due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that occurs in carboxylic acid dimers.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Specifically, a carbonyl in a conjugated aromatic carboxylic acid appears around 1720-1680 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both the very broad O-H and the C=O stretch strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). Its integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment. It is a singlet because acidic protons typically do not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange with trace amounts of water.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. In such a symmetrical ring, the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side. This creates two sets of equivalent protons, which split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data:**\n\n1.  **MS** tells us the compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (Molecular Mass = 7\\*12 + 5\\*1 + 35 + 2\\*16 = 156).\n2.  **IR** tells us the compound has a carboxylic acid functional group.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and tells us the benzene ring is para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this synthesis:\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** Chlorine and carboxylic acid are at the 1 and 4 (para) positions on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Fits MS:** Yes, M=156 with one Cl.\n    *   **Fits IR:** Yes, it is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Fits NMR:** Yes, it has the acidic proton (~11 ppm) and the para-substitution pattern (two doublets, each 2H). This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid, and the 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring would give a more complex NMR signal (three distinct aromatic protons), not two doublets.\n\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted isomer. The lack of symmetry would result in four unique aromatic proton signals, creating a complex multiplet, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester/acid chloride. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. It also lacks the acidic proton, so it would not have the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 amu (using the most abundant isotopes).\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158 is the M+2 peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which simplifies to approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75.8% for ³⁵Cl and 24.2% for ³⁷Cl.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the proposed structures. The molecular formula for all options (A, B, C, D) is C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass is (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. All options are consistent with the MS data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group. This rules out Phenyl chloroformate (C), which lacks an O-H group, and makes 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D) less likely, as a phenolic O-H is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)** is in the typical chemical shift range for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its high chemical shift (downfield) is due to deshielding, and it appears as a singlet because acidic protons often do not couple with neighboring protons due to rapid chemical exchange. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid and rules out options C and D. We are now left with A (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (2-chlorobenzoic acid).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**. This pattern is crucial for determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two distinct doublets.\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is para-substituted. This structure would exhibit this exact NMR pattern.\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is ortho-substituted. This would result in four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Combining all the evidence, the compound must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. It has the correct molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern (MS), the characteristic functional groups of a carboxylic acid (IR), and the specific NMR pattern of a para-substituted aromatic ring attached to a carboxylic acid (¹H NMR).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (natural abundance: ~75% ³⁵Cl, ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weight for the proposed structures using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl):\n*   Formula for A, B, and D (C₇H₅ClO₂): (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n*   Formula for C (C₇H₅ClO₂): Same as above, 156 g/mol.\nAll options are consistent with the molecular weight and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is expected around 1725-1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This immediately makes options C (Phenyl chloroformate, an ester/acid halide) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde/phenol) highly unlikely. The evidence strongly points toward a chlorobenzoic acid (A or B).\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH). The 's' (singlet) indicates it has no adjacent protons to couple with, which is expected. The integration '1H' confirms it represents one proton. This further supports the conclusion that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We see two distinct signals, both of which are doublets ('d'). The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H on the aromatic ring. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons.\n\n**4. Final Structure Determination:**\n\n*   Based on all the data, the compound is a carboxylic acid containing one chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring.\n*   The NMR data specifically indicates a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   Let's compare the remaining options:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern, which would produce two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has an *ortho* (1,2) substitution pattern. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern with four unique aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, all evidence points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with its most common isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is the M+2 peak. The intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak is 32/100, which is approximately 1:3.\n    *   This characteristic M+ to M+2 ratio of 3:1 is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has a molecular formula with a mass of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. The python code confirmed that all options have a molecular weight of 156.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch, and its position is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   These two features together strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid group. This eliminates options C (Phenyl chloroformate) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm** is in the far downfield region, which is characteristic of the highly acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration (1H) confirms it is a single proton. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are key. There are two signals, one at **8.02 ppm** and another at **7.72 ppm**.\n    *   Each signal is a doublet (d), meaning the protons giving rise to that signal are adjacent to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to two protons (2H), meaning there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons next to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons next to the other substituent also equivalent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring substituted with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The NMR data tells us the substitution pattern is para (1,4).\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nLet's check the options again:\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted carboxylic acid. It fits all the data perfectly.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is ortho-substituted. It would give a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region (four separate signals), not two doublets.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is not a carboxylic acid. It would not show the IR or NMR signals for the -COOH group.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. The spectral data would be different.\n\nThe only structure consistent with all the provided evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct structure from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There's a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of a single **chlorine atom**. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl, leading to this 3:1 ratio for molecules containing one chlorine atom.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 (with ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom. A quick check of all options reveals they have the formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which matches a mass of 156 amu.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is the hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen together with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (an aldehyde/phenol) and **D) Phenyl chloroformate** (an acid chloride/ester). The remaining candidates are 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift this far downfield (>10 ppm) is definitive for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and its singlet nature is expected. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern is key:\n    *   There are only two signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   Each signal is a doublet, meaning the corresponding protons are split by one neighbor.\n    *   Each signal represents two protons.\n    *   This simple, symmetrical pattern of two doublets for four protons is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chlorine atom and the carboxylic acid group are arranged in a *para* (1,4) fashion on the benzene ring.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid. It fits all the spectral data perfectly: it's a carboxylic acid with a mass of 156 (containing one Cl atom), and its *para* arrangement would produce the symmetrical \"two doublets of 2H each\" pattern in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzoic acid. While it is a carboxylic acid, its lack of symmetry would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four distinct aromatic signals, which contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that is consistent with all the provided evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a second peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern, with a ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1), is a distinctive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom.

Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that strongly indicates the presence of an O-H bond involved in hydrogen bonding. The extreme broadness is the hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.

Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, which would produce a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with three distinct aromatic signals, not two doublets. It also lacks a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl), which matches the MS data.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data.\n    *   **Substitution:** It has a para- (1,4-) substitution pattern, which perfectly explains the ¹H NMR signals (two doublets of 2H each). The carboxylic acid proton explains the singlet at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho- (1,2-) disubstituted ring. This would result in four unique aromatic protons and a much more complex ¹H NMR splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester, not a carboxylic acid, and is inconsistent with the IR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound, using the most common isotopes, is 156 g/mol.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. Its intensity is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a distinctive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formula of the options. All proposed structures (A, B, C, D) are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Nominal Mass Calculation: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   This confirms that all options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, such as a carboxylic acid attached to a benzene ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid derivative without an O-H group) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenol O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but the O-H peak is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We see two signals in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm): 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (like -COOH and -Cl), there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are identical, and they couple with their neighbors, creating a doublet. The same applies to the other pair of protons.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The aromatic substitution pattern is *para*.\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted. It would show a more complex pattern for its 4 distinct aromatic protons.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed \"two doublets of 2H each\" signal. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the -Cl atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the spectral data, we can confidently identify the compound.\n*   MS shows a molecule with formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   IR identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and establishes a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nThe only option that fits all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The intensity ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which is very close to 3:1. This pattern is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight using the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl) is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. The molecular weight using the ³⁷Cl isotope is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158. All four options have this formula, so the MS data is consistent with any of them.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence allows us to eliminate option B (an aldehyde and a phenol) and option C (a chloroformate, which is an acid chloride derivative and would lack the broad O-H peak). We are left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region, at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm.\n        *   The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), which is consistent with a disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n        *   The splitting pattern is crucial. We see two doublets. This symmetric pattern is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. Each set splits the other into a doublet.\n        *   Option A, **4-chlorobenzoic acid**, is a 1,4-disubstituted ring and would produce this exact two-doublet pattern. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be at 7.72 ppm.\n        *   Option D, **2-chlorobenzoic acid**, is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) ring. This structure lacks the symmetry of the para isomer. It would have four chemically distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four different multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the combined evidence, the only structure that fits all the spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and presence of chlorine. The IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most importantly, the para substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires integrating information from multiple spectroscopic techniques. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the data provided.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak, has a relative abundance of about 32% (100% for 156, 32% for 158). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive signature for the presence of a single **chlorine atom** in the molecule. (Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of ~75% and ~25%, respectively).\n\nSo, we are looking for a chlorine-containing compound with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl). My calculation confirmed all four options have the correct molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) and molecular weight to match the mass spectrometry data. Therefore, we must rely on the other spectra to distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\nThis IR evidence strongly suggests the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options A (an aldehyde/phenol) and C (a chloroformate), which would not show the broad O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. We are now left with options B and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (highly deshielded) is typical for an acidic proton. A chemical shift around 10-13 ppm is classic for a **carboxylic acid proton**. The 's' indicates it's a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with), and '1H' means it corresponds to one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The key information here is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each integrating to two protons (2H). Each signal is a doublet ('d'), meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   This symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. In such a ring, there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent.\n\nLet's examine the remaining options:\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly the symmetrical pattern observed: two doublets, each for 2H.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2- (ortho) substituted benzene ring. This structure is not symmetrical and would have four unique aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern (likely four distinct multiplets), not two clean doublets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the spectral data:\n*   **MS** tells us the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **IR** identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals a 1,4-disubstituted (para) aromatic ring structure.\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a strong indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed structures, assuming one chlorine atom. The formula for all options A, B, C, and D is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight (using ³⁵Cl) = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + (1 * 35.45) + (2 * 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. The integer mass is 156.\n    *   Molecular Weight (using ³⁷Cl) = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + (1 * 37.45) + (2 * 16.00) ≈ 158.5 g/mol. The integer mass is 158.\n    *   All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is right in the range for a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (typically 1710-1680 cm⁻¹).\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This rules out option A (aldehyde/phenol) and option D (chloroformate), as they would not have the characteristic broad O-H peak of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (highly deshielded) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (due to rapid exchange and no adjacent protons) confirms this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a *para*- (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the ring makes the two protons on one side equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n        *   This pattern eliminates 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B), which is *ortho*-disubstituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern with four unique aromatic protons.\n        *   This pattern perfectly matches 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C).

This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of chlorine, ³⁵Cl.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the same chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This evidence rules out Phenyl chloroformate (A), which is an acid chloride, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D), which is an aldehyde and a phenol. Phenolic -OH peaks are typically broad but usually don't extend as low as 2700 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ = 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is definitively a proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This further confirms the IR analysis and rules out options A and D. The signal is a singlet because carboxylic acid protons are acidic and typically do not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange.\n    *   **δ = 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and δ = 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H). This highly symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals.\n    *   Comparing the remaining options, 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B) has an *ortho* substitution pattern, which would result in four distinct aromatic proton signals with more complex splitting (not two simple doublets).\n    *   4-chlorobenzoic acid (C) has a *para* substitution pattern. This perfectly matches the observed NMR data, giving two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom. The IR and ¹H NMR confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The ¹H NMR aromatic region pattern confirms a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher than the molecular ion peak, is called the M+2 peak. The relative intensity of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This specific 3:1 ratio is a tell-tale sign for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule, as chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (approx. 75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (approx. 25% abundance).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (containing ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position, coupled with the O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. The conjugation with an aromatic ring slightly lowers the frequency to this range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. It is a singlet because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with and often exchanges too rapidly to show coupling. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4 aromatic protons. This means the benzene ring is disubstituted.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of **1,4-disubstitution (para-substitution)** on a benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to the two on the other, giving two signals. They appear as doublets because each proton is split by its single ortho neighbor.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesis and Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **From the data:** We are looking for a para-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a benzoic acid (has -COOH) with a chlorine atom at the para (4) position.\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of 156 for the ³⁵Cl isotope. (Correct)\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. (Correct)\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a -COOH proton and a para-disubstituted ring, which would give two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. (Correct)\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is ortho-substituted. The ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two doublets. (Incorrect)\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the -COOH proton at ~11 ppm and would not show the very broad IR stretch from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. (Incorrect)\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloroformate. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group, so it would not have the IR peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11 ppm.

The ratio of the intensities of the M⁺ to M⁺+2 peaks is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine (Cl) atom, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%) isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (11.0 ppm):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** The signal corresponds to one proton.\n    *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** Carboxylic acid protons are acidic and typically exchange rapidly, so they do not show coupling to adjacent protons, appearing as a singlet.\n    *   This signal confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region:** Both signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic sign of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution creates two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (at 8.02 ppm).\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   Each set of protons is split into a doublet by its neighbors.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring in a *para* (1,4) arrangement.\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\nThe evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points to a single structure:\n*   From MS: MW = 156, contains one Cl.\n*   From IR & ¹H NMR: Contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR: The -COOH and -Cl groups are in a *para* arrangement on a benzene ring.\n\nThis structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group required by the IR and the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Correct. The molecular weight (C₇H₅ClO₂ gives MW=156 for ³⁵Cl), functional groups (carboxylic acid), and substitution pattern (*para*) all perfectly match the provided data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. While it has the correct formula and functional groups, its *ortho* substitution would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic signals, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\nThe most reasonable structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound based on its most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the molecular ion peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options, using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl):\n        *   All four options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   The M+2 peak would be from the ³⁷Cl isotope: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 158 g/mol.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. This eliminates none of the options, but confirms the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This value is typical for an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This strongly supports options A and D, and rules out options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride/ester which lacks the O-H group) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde/phenol, which would have a different C=O stretch and a phenolic O-H stretch, not the very broad carboxylic acid O-H).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The singlet multiplicity is also expected. This further supports options A and D.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region is crucial. Having only two signals, both of which are doublets and integrate to 2 protons each, indicates a highly symmetric, para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring's axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two on the other side.\n        *   **Structure A (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly this pattern: two doublets, each representing 2 protons.\n        *   **Structure D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. All four aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments relative to the two different substituents. This would result in a more complex pattern, likely with four separate signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H. It would not produce two doublets of 2H each.\n\n*   **Final Synthesis:**\n    *   The MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine.\n    *   The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The aromatic region of the NMR (two doublets of 2H each) confirms a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (A) fits all of these spectral data points.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires combining information from multiple spectroscopic techniques. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue is 156 g/mol.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   There is a very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimerization.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This immediately makes options B (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates, while ruling out A (phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and D (3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Peak at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-CO**O**H). The integration confirms it is a single proton (1H). It is a singlet because acidic protons typically do not couple with other protons. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Peaks in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm):** There are two distinct signals.\n        *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** A signal for two equivalent aromatic protons. The doublet multiplicity means they are coupled to one neighboring proton.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** A signal for two other equivalent aromatic protons. The doublet multiplicity also indicates they are coupled to one neighboring proton.\n    *   This pattern—two doublets, each integrating to two protons—is a classic signature for a *para*- (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the ring makes the two protons on one side equivalent to the two protons on the other.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Ruled out by IR and NMR (no carboxylic acid).\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid, consistent with IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. This lack of symmetry means there would be four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid.\n        *   **MS:** Molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. Let's calculate the MW: (7*12) + (5*1) + 35 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches. It contains Cl, also a match.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. This matches.\n        *   **NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm). It has a *para*-disubstituted ring, which would produce the observed symmetrical pattern of two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm). This is a perfect match for all the data.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Ruled out by IR and NMR (it's an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the aromatic NMR pattern would be different).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak), which is about one-third (32%) the intensity of the M+ peak.\n    *   This characteristic M:M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale sign for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ~75.8% for ³⁵Cl and ~24.2% for ³⁷Cl).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options for the ³⁵Cl isotope:\n        *   All options (2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, Phenyl chloroformate) have the same molecular formula: C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   The molecular weight is calculated as: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   For the ³⁷Cl isotope, the weight would be 158 g/mol.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak stretching from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, where the broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) group stretch. This value falls squarely in the range for the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid (typically 1710-1680 cm⁻¹), often slightly higher due to conjugation or electron-withdrawing substituents.\n    *   Based on these two key peaks, the compound must be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This allows us to eliminate option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is a phenol and an aldehyde. While it has an O-H and C=O group, the O-H stretch of a phenol is typically less broad (~3600-3200 cm⁻¹), and the very broad peak down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is the classic sign of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   We can also eliminate option D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an acid chloride/ester hybrid. It has a C=O bond but no O-H group, so it would not show the broad peak in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ region.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is a carboxylic acid, narrowing the choices down to A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is in the far downfield region, which is characteristic of the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms one such proton. This is consistent with both remaining options A and B.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are key to determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. We see two distinct signals:\n        *   8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n        *   7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n    *   This pattern, two doublets each integrating to two protons, indicates a highly symmetric, 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent to each other.\n    *   Let's examine the remaining structures:\n        *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). It has no such plane of symmetry. All four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments and would give rise to a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals. This does not match the data.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,4-disubstituted (para). It possesses the required symmetry. The two protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to the -COOH group) are equivalent. The two protons at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to the -Cl group) are equivalent. This structure would produce exactly two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. The protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm). This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The MS data indicates a formula of C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   The IR data identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data establishes a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   Combining all the evidence, the only structure that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes. So, the molecular mass is 156 u.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 with an abundance of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a hallmark signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. The two major isotopes of chlorine are ³⁵Cl (~75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2% abundance). The molecule containing ³⁵Cl has a mass of 156 u, and the one containing ³⁷Cl has a mass of 158 u. The ratio of their abundances (~76:24) is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 u and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The wide range is due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that occurs in carboxylic acid dimers.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Specifically, a carbonyl in a conjugated aromatic carboxylic acid appears around 1720-1680 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both the very broad O-H and the C=O stretch strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). Its integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment. It is a singlet because acidic protons typically do not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange with trace amounts of water.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. In such a symmetrical ring, the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side. This creates two sets of equivalent protons, which split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data:**\n\n1.  **MS** tells us the compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (Molecular Mass = 7\\*12 + 5\\*1 + 35 + 2\\*16 = 156).\n2.  **IR** tells us the compound has a carboxylic acid functional group.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and tells us the benzene ring is para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this synthesis:\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** Chlorine and carboxylic acid are at the 1 and 4 (para) positions on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Fits MS:** Yes, M=156 with one Cl.\n    *   **Fits IR:** Yes, it is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Fits NMR:** Yes, it has the acidic proton (~11 ppm) and the para-substitution pattern (two doublets, each 2H). This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid, and the 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring would give a more complex NMR signal (three distinct aromatic protons), not two doublets.\n\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted isomer. The lack of symmetry would result in four unique aromatic proton signals, creating a complex multiplet, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester/acid chloride. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. It also lacks the acidic proton, so it would not have the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 amu (using the most abundant isotopes).\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158 is the M+2 peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which simplifies to approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75.8% for ³⁵Cl and 24.2% for ³⁷Cl.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the proposed structures. The molecular formula for all options (A, B, C, D) is C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass is (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. All options are consistent with the MS data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group. This rules out Phenyl chloroformate (C), which lacks an O-H group, and makes 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D) less likely, as a phenolic O-H is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)** is in the typical chemical shift range for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its high chemical shift (downfield) is due to deshielding, and it appears as a singlet because acidic protons often do not couple with neighboring protons due to rapid chemical exchange. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid and rules out options C and D. We are now left with A (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (2-chlorobenzoic acid).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**. This pattern is crucial for determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two distinct doublets.\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is para-substituted. This structure would exhibit this exact NMR pattern.\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is ortho-substituted. This would result in four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Combining all the evidence, the compound must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. It has the correct molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern (MS), the characteristic functional groups of a carboxylic acid (IR), and the specific NMR pattern of a para-substituted aromatic ring attached to a carboxylic acid (¹H NMR).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (natural abundance: ~75% ³⁵Cl, ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weight for the proposed structures using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl):\n*   Formula for A, B, and D (C₇H₅ClO₂): (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n*   Formula for C (C₇H₅ClO₂): Same as above, 156 g/mol.\nAll options are consistent with the molecular weight and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is expected around 1725-1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This immediately makes options C (Phenyl chloroformate, an ester/acid halide) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde/phenol) highly unlikely. The evidence strongly points toward a chlorobenzoic acid (A or B).\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH). The 's' (singlet) indicates it has no adjacent protons to couple with, which is expected. The integration '1H' confirms it represents one proton. This further supports the conclusion that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We see two distinct signals, both of which are doublets ('d'). The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H on the aromatic ring. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons.\n\n**4. Final Structure Determination:**\n\n*   Based on all the data, the compound is a carboxylic acid containing one chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring.\n*   The NMR data specifically indicates a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   Let's compare the remaining options:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern, which would produce two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has an *ortho* (1,2) substitution pattern. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern with four unique aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, all evidence points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with its most common isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is the M+2 peak. The intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak is 32/100, which is approximately 1:3.\n    *   This characteristic M+ to M+2 ratio of 3:1 is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has a molecular formula with a mass of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. The python code confirmed that all options have a molecular weight of 156.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch, and its position is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   These two features together strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid group. This eliminates options C (Phenyl chloroformate) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm** is in the far downfield region, which is characteristic of the highly acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration (1H) confirms it is a single proton. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are key. There are two signals, one at **8.02 ppm** and another at **7.72 ppm**.\n    *   Each signal is a doublet (d), meaning the protons giving rise to that signal are adjacent to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to two protons (2H), meaning there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons next to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons next to the other substituent also equivalent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring substituted with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The NMR data tells us the substitution pattern is para (1,4).\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nLet's check the options again:\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted carboxylic acid. It fits all the data perfectly.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is ortho-substituted. It would give a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region (four separate signals), not two doublets.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is not a carboxylic acid. It would not show the IR or NMR signals for the -COOH group.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. The spectral data would be different.\n\nThe only structure consistent with all the provided evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
