Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the initial NN system is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and Particle X\nThe process is `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`. The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`, relative to the final NN system.\n*   **Final NN state (`NN_f`)**: It is described by a term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`. The problem states we should assume its total isospin is `T_{NN_f} = 0`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Governing Rules\nThe reaction must obey several conservation laws and principles. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of them.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics (as given)**\n    The problem provides a specific condition from the generalized Pauli exclusion principle: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are told to assume the final NN state has `T_{NN_f} = 0`. Plugging this into the formula:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**. Any final NN state where `S_f + L_f` is even will violate this condition and is therefore not permitted.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be the same before and after the reaction.\n    `P_i = P_f`\n    `P_i = +1` (from the initial `1S0` state).\n    The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    So, `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n    This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum `J` must be conserved. `J_i = J_f`.\n    `J_i = 0`. So, the total angular momentum of the final system must be `J_f = 0`.\n    The final angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`), the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`), and its spin (`s_X`): `vec{J_f} = vec{J_{NN_f}} + vec{l_X} + vec{s_X}`.\n    For `J_f` to be zero, it must be possible to combine these three vectors to get zero. This is a broad condition, but it can be checked for each case. A simpler check, assuming `s_X=0`, would be `J_{NN_f} = l_X`. We will see if this assumption is necessary.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of States**\n    The quantum states themselves must be physically possible. For a system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions), the total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet).\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's create a table to check each option against the rules.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`S_f, L_f, J_f`) | Particle X (`l_X`) | Rule 1: `S_f+L_f` (must be odd?) | Rule 2: `L_f+l_X` (must be odd?) | Rule 4: `S_f` possible? |\n|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A) `7D1` | S=3, L=2, J=1 | p (l=1) | 3+2 = 5 (**OK**) | 2+1 = 3 (**OK**) | `S=3` (**Forbidden**) |\n| B) `3D3` | S=1, L=2, J=3 | f (l=3) | 1+2 = 3 (**OK**) | 2+3 = 5 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n| C) `3S1` | S=1, L=0, J=1 | p (l=1) | 1+0 = 1 (**OK**) | 0+1 = 1 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n| D) `3P0` | S=1, L=1, J=0 | s (l=0) | 1+1 = 2 (**Forbidden**) | 1+0 = 1 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nFrom the analysis, we find two forbidden reactions:\n\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3` (`2S+1=7`). This is impossible, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`.\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics condition given in the problem. For the final state to have `T=0`, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be odd. For the `3P0` state, `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f + L_f = 2`, which is even.\n\nWhen a multiple-choice question has two seemingly correct answers, it's often because one violates a condition explicitly provided in the problem statement, which is intended to be the primary focus. The problem explicitly gives the Pauli condition and the requirement that `T(NN_f)=0`. Option D is the only one that fails this specific test. The impossibility of state `7D1` in Option A relies on general background knowledge not explicitly written in the problem's rule set. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the test set up by the problem itself.\n\nThe state `3P0` is a valid NN state, but it must have T=1. The problem asks to consider a hypothetical transition to a `T=0` state. Since a `3P0` state cannot have `T=0`, the transition is forbidden.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Conservation Laws\n\nWe need to check which of the proposed reactions is forbidden. A reaction is forbidden if it violates a fundamental conservation law or a given physical principle. The relevant principles here are:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The final two-nucleon (NN) state must be consistent with the Pauli principle. The problem provides a specific condition for this.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   The initial state is a two-nucleon system (NN) in a **1S0** state.\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_initial = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Parity of the initial state:** The parity of a system with orbital angular momentum L is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n    *   `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   The final state consists of the final NN system and the emitted particle X.\n*   The reaction is: `NN_initial (1S0) -> NN_final + X`.\n\n**A. Conservation of Parity**\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_final` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_final`, where `L_final` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n    *   `P(X)_intrinsic = -1` (given in the problem).\n    *   `P(X)_orbital = (-1)^l_X`, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   Putting it together:\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_final + l_X)`\n*   This equation is satisfied only if `(-1)^(L_final + l_X) = -1`, which means the exponent `(L_final + l_X)` must be **odd**.\n\n**B. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n*   `J_initial = J_final`\n*   `J_initial = 0`.\n*   `J_final` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_final(NN)`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`J_X`).\n*   The problem does not specify the spin of particle X. A common simplification in such problems is to assume X is spinless (like a pion). If `s_X = 0`, then `J_X = l_X`.\n*   The total final angular momentum is the vector sum `J_final = J_final(NN) + l_X`.\n*   For `J_final` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_final(NN) = l_X`.\n\n**C. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\n*   The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the following condition must hold:\n    `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`:\n    `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   This implies that `(S_final + L_final)` must be **odd**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each option against these three conditions:\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final` must be odd.\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = l_X`.\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X` must be odd.\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 0`, `J_final(NN) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 1`, `J_final(NN) = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the condition. **FORBIDDEN.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 0`, `l_X = 0`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n---\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final(NN) = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 3`, `l_X = 3`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S_final = 3`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final(NN) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Note:** A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 (antiparallel) or S=1 (parallel). S=3 is physically impossible for this system. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed. However, let's check the transition rules as requested by the problem structure.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: The transition itself obeys all the conservation laws. The reaction is forbidden only because the final product `7D1` is not a possible state for two nucleons.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nComparing the options, option B is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle condition explicitly provided in the problem statement. Option D is forbidden for a different reason: the final state itself is unphysical. In the context of such problems, one should primarily focus on applying the given rules and conservation laws to the transition process. Option B fails one of these explicit checks, making it the most direct and intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system (`NN_i`).\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` denotes the orbital angular momentum, so `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` denotes the total angular momentum, so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The initial system emits a particle X: `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `l_X`.\n        *   `s`: `l_X = 0`\n        *   `p`: `l_X = 1`\n        *   `f`: `l_X = 3`\n\n*   **Final State:** A final two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and particle X.\n    *   The final NN system has isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Selection Rules (Conservation Laws)\n\nWe need to check three conditions for each proposed reaction. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of these rules.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final NN State**\n    *   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN_f) = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this into the rule gives: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation is true only if `S_f + L_f` is an odd number.\n    *   **Condition 1:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    *   The total angular momentum of the initial system (`J_i = 0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final system.\n    *   The final system's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). (We assume particle X has no spin, which is standard for particles like pions denoted by `s, p, ...` states).\n    *   The conservation law is `vec{J_i} = vec{J_f} + vec{l_X}`.\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, this implies `vec{J_f} + vec{l_X} = 0`, which can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n    *   **Condition 2:** `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Parity**\n    *   The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state: `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final state's parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`.\n        *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n        *   `P(X) = -1` (given intrinsic parity).\n        *   `P_orbital = (-1)^{l_X}` (parity from the relative motion of X).\n    *   So, the conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`, or `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n    *   This requires the exponent to be odd.\n    *   **Condition 3:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nNow we apply these three conditions to each of the given reactions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` state): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Check Condition 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   The reaction is not permitted.\n\nSince we have already found a violation, this is the answer. For completeness, let's check the other options.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` state): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` implies `S_f = 3`. A two-nucleon system is made of two spin-1/2 particles, so its total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for two nucleons. Therefore, this reaction is forbidden because the final state cannot exist.\n*   However, if we mechanically apply the selection rules as requested:\n    *   `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n    *   `l_X = 1`.\n    *   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n    *   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n    *   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n*   The process itself obeys all the given selection rules, but it leads to an impossible state. The question asks which *partial wave* is not permitted based on the given rules. Option A is the only one that violates one of those rules directly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state, which requires `S_f + L_f` to be odd. In this case, `1 + 1 = 2`, which is even.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers for this state:\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that the sum `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where T is the isospin. For the initial state, we have `L_i = 0` and `S_i = 0`, so `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This requires the isospin of the initial state to be `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, for the initial state `1S0`: `J_i = 0`, `P_i = +1`, `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: It has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. The problem does not specify the spin of X. A common particle emitted in such decays is a pion (π), which has spin `S_X = 0`. We will assume `S_X = 0`, which is standard for this type of problem unless specified otherwise. The orbital angular momentum of X is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`), which corresponds to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3` respectively.\n*   **Final NN state**: It has isospin `T_f = 0`. Its quantum numbers are given by the term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n\nWe must check three conservation laws and one statistical rule:\n\n**A. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle X's total angular momentum `J_X`. `vec{J}_{final} = vec{J}_f + vec{J}_X`.\n*   With `S_X = 0`, `vec{J}_X = vec{l}_X + vec{S}_X = vec{l}_X`, so `J_X = l_X`.\n*   For `vec{J}_{final}` to be zero, we must be able to couple `vec{J}_f` and `vec{l}_X` to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**B. Conservation of Parity:**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the final particles and the parity from their relative orbital motion: `P_{final} = P_{NN_f} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n*   `P_{NN_f} = (-1)^{L_f}` and `P_X = -1`.\n*   So, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n*   For this equation to hold, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**C. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\nThe problem explicitly states the condition from Pauli statistics: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n*   This, in turn, implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\nA transition is \"not permitted\" if it violates any of these three conditions.\n\n### 3.

Although it satisfies the conservation of angular momentum and parity, it violates the Pauli principle for the final two-nucleon state. For the final state `3P0`, we have `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f + L_f = 2` (even). According to the Pauli principle for a `T_f=0` state, `S_f + L_f` must be odd. Therefore, a `3P0` state with `T=0` cannot exist for a two-nucleon system, and the transition is forbidden.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe system starts as a bound state of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`, we have `2S+1 = 1`, which means the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` means the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n*   The particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The particle X is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X`. The lowercase letters denote this: `s` (l=0), `p` (l=1), `d` (l=2), `f` (l=3).\n*   The final NN state has quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must apply three conservation laws and constraints:\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state is `J_i = 0`. The total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the total to be conserved (`J_final = J_i = 0`), we must have `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:**\n    The parity of the initial state is `P_i = +1`. The parity of the final state is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(relative motion)`.\n    `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that `T_f = 0`. Substituting this in, we get:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This equation holds if and only if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against the three derived conditions:\n1.  `J_f = l_X`\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd\n\n| Option | Reaction               | NN Final State (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) | X State (`l_X`) | `J_f = l_X`? | `L_f + l_X` is odd? | `S_f + L_f` is odd? | Permitted? |\n| :----: | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------- | :------------------ | :------------------ | :--------- |\n| **A)** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`       | S=1, L=1, J=0                        | l=0             | 0 = 0 (Yes)  | 1 + 0 = 1 (Yes)     | 1 + 1 = 2 (**No**)  | **No**     |\n| **B)** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`       | S=1, L=2, J=3                        | l=3             | 3 = 3 (Yes)  | 2 + 3 = 5 (Yes)     | 1 + 2 = 3 (Yes)     | Yes        |\n| **C)** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`       | S=3, L=2, J=1                        | l=1             | 1 = 1 (Yes)  | 2 + 1 = 3 (Yes)     | 3 + 2 = 5 (Yes)     | Yes*       |\n| **D)** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`       | S=1, L=0, J=1                        | l=1             | 1 = 1 (Yes)  | 0 + 1 = 1 (Yes)     | 1 + 0 = 1 (Yes)     | Yes        |\n\n\\*Note on Option C: The final state `7D1` implies a spin `S=3` for the two-nucleon system. Since nucleons are spin-1/2 particles, their total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. Thus, the state `7D1` is physically impossible. However, when strictly applying the rules *given in the problem*, this transition is formally allowed. The question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave based on the provided conservation laws and Pauli condition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, reaction A is the only one that violates one of the conditions explicitly derived from the problem statement. It fails the Pauli statistics requirement that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` final state.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers using the notation `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is 'S' => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is '0' => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe intrinsic parity of the initial NN system is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nThe generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule: `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, where `T` is the total isospin. For the initial `1S0` state (`L_i=0, S_i=0`), we have `(-1)^(0+0+T_i) = -1`, which means `(-1)^(T_i) = -1`. This requires `T_i` to be odd. The lowest possible value is `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nThe system decays as `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must apply several rules to determine if a transition is permitted.\n\n**Constraint 1: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt also specifies that the final NN state has `T(NN, final) = 0`.\nSubstituting `T=0` into the given rule:\n`0 = S(NN, final) + L(NN, final) + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis means that `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final) + 1` must be an even number.\nThis is equivalent to requiring `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final)` to be an **odd** number.\n\n**Constraint 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n`J_i = J_f`\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\nThe final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system, `J(NN, final)`, and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `L(X)`.\nSo, `J_f = J(NN, final) + L(X)`.\nFor `J_f` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN, final) = L(X)`.\n\n**Constraint 3: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity `P` must be conserved.\n`P_i = P_f`\nThe initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\nThe final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN, final) * P(X) * (-1)^(L(X))`.\n*   `P(NN, final) = (-1)^(L(NN, final))`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `(-1)^(L(X))` is the parity associated with the relative orbital motion of X.\n\nSo, the conservation equation is:\n`+1 = (-1)^(L(NN, final)) * (-1) * (-1)^(L(X))`\n`+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN, final) + L(X))`\n`-1 = (-1)^(L(NN, final) + L(X))`\nThis requires the exponent `L(NN, final) + L(X)` to be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\nWe now apply these three constraints to each proposed final state. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these constraints. The lowercase letters (s, p, f) denote `L(X)`: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L(X)=0`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). The sum must be odd. **This rule is VIOLATED.**\n*   Constraint 2 (J conservation): `J(NN)=0`, `L(X)=0`. `0=0`. (Satisfied).\n*   Constraint 3 (P conservation): `L(NN) + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nSince the Pauli principle is violated, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L(X)=3`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 2 (J conservation):** `J(NN)=3`, `L(X)=3`. `3=3`. (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 3 (P conservation):** `L(NN) + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: This notation implies `2S+1=7`, which means `S=3`.\n*   A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their spins can only combine to a total spin `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). It is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system to have `S=3`.\n*   Therefore, the final state `7D1` does not exist for this system, and the transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 2 (J conservation):** `J(NN)=1`, `L(X)=1`. `1=1`. (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 3 (P conservation):** `L(NN) + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe have identified two \"not permitted\" transitions:\n*   A) is not permitted because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final state.\n*   C) is not permitted because the proposed final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, a physically impossible state like `7D1` is almost always a typo. The question is designed to test the application of conservation laws and symmetry principles to the dynamics of the decay. Option A represents a transition between two valid states that is forbidden by one of these specific principles given in the problem. This is a much more likely intended answer than one that relies on identifying a typo. Assuming `C` was a typo for a valid state like `3D1` (which would be a permitted transition), then `A` is the unique answer that is not permitted due to the violation of the physical laws governing the interaction.\n\nTherefore, the intended answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => The total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` => The initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` => The total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`. This is consistent since `J_i` must be between `|L_i - S_i|` and `L_i + S_i`, which is just 0.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Reaction and Final State\nThe reaction is the emission of a particle X: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`, is denoted by a lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN State:** Represented by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n*   **Final System:** `NN(final) + X`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nWe need to check three conditions for the reaction to be permitted.\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n*   `J_initial` = `J_i` = 0.\n*   `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`. So, `J_final` can range from `|J_f - l_X|` to `J_f + l_X`.\n*   For `J_final` to be equal to `J_initial = 0`, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    **`J_f = l_X`** (C1)\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n*   `P_initial` = Parity of the NN(1S0) state = `(-1)^L_i` = `(-1)^0` = `+1`.\n*   `P_final` = `P_NN(final) * P_X(emitted)`.\n    *   `P_NN(final)` = `(-1)^L_f`.\n    *   `P_X(emitted)` = `P_X(intrinsic) * (-1)^l_X` = `(-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   The conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X` = `(-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This implies that:\n    **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.** (C2)\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem provides a specific constraint derived from the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state, assuming its total isospin is `T_f = 0`.\n*   Given: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   Substituting `T_f = 0`: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This can be rearranged to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This means that:\n    **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.** (C3)\n\nA reaction is \"not permitted\" if it violates at least one of these three conditions.\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (3S1): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (p): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Check Conditions:\n    *   C1: `J_f = l_X`?  => `1 = 1`.

Two nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions, so their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). It is impossible for two nucleons to form an `S=3` state. Therefore, this reaction is not permitted because the final state cannot exist. However, let's check the given selection rules for completeness.\n*   Particle X (p): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Check Conditions:\n    *   C1: `J_f = l_X`?  => `1 = 1`.

(**✗**)\n*   **Result: Not permitted.** This reaction violates the Pauli statistics constraint given in the problem statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have identified two forbidden reactions:\n*   **C** is forbidden because the final NN state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **D** is forbidden because it violates one of the specific rules provided in the question (the Pauli constraint).\n\nThe question asks us to identify the non-permitted partial wave by making use of the conservation laws and the specific Pauli statistics rule. Reaction D is the one that is disallowed specifically by these rules. Reaction C is disallowed for a more fundamental reason (the composition of the NN system) that precedes the application of the reaction rules. Therefore, the most direct answer to the question as posed is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_initial + 1 = 1`  => `S_initial = 0` (Total spin of the two nucleons is 0, a singlet state).\n*   `L = S` => `L_initial = 0` (Total orbital angular momentum of the two nucleons is 0).\n*   `J = 0` => `J_initial = 0` (Total angular momentum of the initial NN system).\n*   **Parity of the initial NN state (`P_initial_NN`)**: The parity of a two-particle system is given by `(-1)^L`. So, `P_initial_NN = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`. We need to check several rules for each proposed final state.\n\n*   **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**: The problem explicitly states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are also given that the final state has isospin `T_final = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T_final = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_final + L_final + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_final + L_final` must be an **odd number**. This is a critical selection rule for the final NN state.\n\n*   **Parity Conservation**: The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `P_initial_total = P_final_total`\n    *   `P_initial_total` is the parity of the initial `1S0` NN state, which is `+1`.\n    *   `P_final_total = P_final_NN * P_X * P_orbital`.\n        *   `P_final_NN = (-1)^L_final` (parity of the final NN internal state).\n        *   `P_X = -1` (intrinsic parity of particle X, given).\n        *   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the relative motion between X and the final NN system, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of X).\n    *   The conservation equation is: `+1 = ((-1)^L_final) * (-1) * ((-1)^l_X)`.\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^(L_final + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This implies that the exponent `L_final + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `L_final + l_X` must be an **odd number**.\n\n*   **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial_total = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_initial_total = J_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the angular momenta in the final state: the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_final`) and the total angular momentum of particle X.\n    *   The total angular momentum of X is `j_X`, which is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `s_X`.\n    *   The conservation law is `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final) + vec(j_X)` or `0 = vec(J_final) + vec(l_X) + vec(s_X)`.\n    *   This means the three vectors `vec(J_final)`, `vec(l_X)`, and `vec(s_X)` must form a closed triangle (their vector sum is zero). A consequence of this is the triangle inequality: `|J_final - l_X| <= s_X <= J_final + l_X`.\n    *   A common simplification occurs if particle X is spinless (`s_X=0`), like a pion (`π`). In that case, `vec(J_final) + vec(l_X) = 0`, which implies `J_final = l_X`. We will check this simpler case first, but the general case allows for a range of `s_X`.\n\n*   **Fundamental Constraints on NN states**: A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). Any other value of S is impossible.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these rules. The final state is `(2S+1)L(J) + l_X`.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_final=1`, `L_final=2`, `J_final=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S=1` is a valid spin for an NN system.\n    2.  **Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)**: `1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n    3.  **Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)**: `2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n    4.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_final=3`, `l_X=3`. We need `|3 - 3| <= s_X <= 3 + 3`, so `0 <= s_X <= 6`. This is possible if X has spin `s_X` in this range (e.g., `s_X=0, 1, 2, ...`).\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S_final=3`. `L_final=2`, `J_final=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S_final=3` is **not possible** for a two-nucleon system. The maximum spin is `1/2 + 1/2 = 1`.\n*   Conclusion: **Not Permitted**. The final NN state is unphysical.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_final=1`, `L_final=0`, `J_final=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S=1` is valid.\n    2.  **Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)**: `1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n    3.  **Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)**: `0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n    4.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_final=1`, `l_X=1`. We need `|1 - 1| <= s_X <= 1 + 1`, so `0 <= s_X <= 2`. This is possible if X has spin `s_X=0, 1, or 2`.\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_final=1`, `L_final=1`, `J_final=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S=1` is valid.\n    2.  **Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)**: `1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_final+L_final` must be odd for `T_final=0`.\n    3.  **Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)**: `1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n    4.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_final=0`, `l_X=0`. We need `|0 - 0| <= s_X <= 0 + 0`, so `s_X = 0`. This is only possible if particle X has spin 0.\n*   Conclusion: **Not Permitted**. This violates the generalized Pauli principle as specified in the problem.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have identified two \"not permitted\" reactions: B and D.\n*   **B is not permitted** because the proposed final state (`7D1`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   **D is not permitted** because it violates the specific selection rule (`T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`) that the problem instructed us to use for a `T_final=0` state.\n\nSince the problem explicitly provides the Pauli statistics rule and the condition `T(NN)=0`, it is highly probable that the question is designed to test the application of this specific rule. Option D is the one that fails this test. While option B is also impossible, it's due to a more fundamental property of nucleons not explicitly mentioned in the problem prompt. The key violation in D relates directly to the information provided.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0` (singlet state).\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State\nThe final state consists of the NN system and an emitted particle X.\n`NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN system is `l_X`, denoted by the lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n    *   Unless specified otherwise, we can assume particle X is spinless (`s_X = 0`), so its total angular momentum is `j_X = l_X`.\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   Its quantum numbers are denoted `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f`.\n    *   We are given that its total isospin is `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Its parity is `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n\n### 3. Apply the Conservation Laws and Given Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for each potential reaction:\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's angular momentum (`j_X`).\n*   `J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum).\n*   Since `J_i = 0`, `J_f` and `j_X` must be coupled to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n*   Assuming `s_X = 0`, we have `j_X = l_X`. So, the condition simplifies to **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities and the orbital parity: `P_f(total) = P_f(NN) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n*   `P(orbital)` is the parity associated with the relative orbital motion of the final particles, which is `(-1)^(l_X)`.\n*   So, `P_f(total) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   The conservation law is `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   This implies the exponent must be even: `L_f + l_X + 1 = 2n`.\n*   This simplifies to the condition that **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states a specific requirement for the final NN state:\n*   `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   We are given `T_f = 0`.\n*   So, `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   For this equation to hold, `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n*   This means **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f = 3` (from `2S+1=7`), `L_f = 2` (D), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `1 = 1`.

(✓)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `0 = 0`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. **(✗ This is an even number, which violates the condition.)**\n*   This reaction is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final state.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is 'S' => Total initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is '0' => Total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity of the NN system is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The system emits a particle X. The reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of X is denoted by `l_X` (where s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n    *   We assume particle X is a meson (like a pion), which has intrinsic spin `s_X = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** A final NN state described by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` and particle X.\n    *   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Conservation Laws and Selection Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for the transition to be permitted:\n\n**a) Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n*   Since we assume `s_X=0`, `j_X = l_X`.\n*   So, `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n*   For `J_i = 0`, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**b) Conservation of Parity (P):**\n*   The initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is `P_f = P_f(NN) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n*   `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n*   `P_intrinsic(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^(l_X)`.\n*   So, `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n*   For parity to be conserved, `P_i = P_f`, so `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n*   This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n**c) Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final State:**\n*   The problem provides the rule for the final NN state: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This means `T_f` and `S_f + L_f + 1` must have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n*   The problem states that we must suppose `T_f = 0` (even).\n*   Therefore, `S_f + L_f + 1` must also be even.\n*   For `S_f + L_f + 1` to be even, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n### 3.

Analyze the Initial State and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system.\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   Initial parity `P_i` depends on the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction:** `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   A particle `X` with intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` is emitted.\n    *   The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes the orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `l_x`.\n    *   s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3.\n\n*   **Final State:** The final NN state `NN(final)` has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n**2. Identify the Governing Rules (Conservation Laws and Statistics)**\n\nWe need to check three conditions for any potential reaction to be allowed.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_x`). For the initial and final total angular momenta to be equal:\n    `J_i = J_f + l_x` (vector sum)\n    `0 = J_f + l_x`\n    This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_x`.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be conserved. The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_x`\n    So, the conservation equation is: `P_i = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x`.\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`\n    For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_x + 1` must be an even number. This implies that the sum `L_f + l_x` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that `T_f = 0`. Substituting this into the rule:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This simplifies to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Therefore, the sum of the final spin and final orbital angular momentum, `S_f + L_f`, must be **odd**.\n\n**3. Test Each Option Against the Rules**\n\nWe will check each option to see if it violates any of these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_x=1`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `1 = 1`.

However, the state `7D1` requires `S=3`. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, making the transition forbidden.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_x=1`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **L_f + l_x = odd?** `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **S_f + L_f = odd?** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n    *This transition is permitted by all rules.*\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_x=3`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **L_f + l_x = odd?** `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **S_f + L_f = odd?** `1 + 2 = 3`.

(VIOLATED)\n    *The sum `S_f + L_f` is even, which violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final state.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe transition in option D) violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly provided in the question for a final state with `T(NN)=0`. Although the final state in option A) is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons, option D) is the one that fails the specific calculation based on the given constraints of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L_J`:\n*   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is 'S', which corresponds to orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is 0, so the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nFrom these quantum numbers, we can determine the parity and isospin of the initial state.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of a system with orbital angular momentum `L` is `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin:** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two identical nucleons states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts.\n    *   Antisymmetry `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1` which implies `L+S+T` must be odd.\n    *   For the initial `1S0` state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which means the initial isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `J_i=0`, `P_i=+1`, `T_i=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system `(NN)_f` and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. It is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN State:** Described by `(2S_f+1)L_f_{J_f}`. The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n\nWe must apply the following rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum `J_i=0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`. So, `vec(J_f) + vec(l_X) = 0`, which implies `J_f = l_X`.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity `P_i=+1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN parity `P_f(NN) = (-1)^{L_f}`, the intrinsic parity of X `P(X)=-1`, and the orbital parity of X's motion `(-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `(-1)^{L_f+l_X+1} = +1`. This means `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even, or `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** The problem states the rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN)` must be odd.\n    *   Given `T_f(NN)=0`, the rule simplifies to `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n4.  **Validity of the Final State:** For a two-nucleon system, the total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). This means `2S_f+1` can only be 1 or 3.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state: `7D1`. This means `2S_f+1=7`, so `S_f=3`.\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=3` is impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is not permitted.**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is permitted.**\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `0 = 0`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(Violation)**\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is not permitted.**\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `3 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is permitted.**\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have found two forbidden transitions:\n*   A is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   C is forbidden because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final state, which is a key selection rule mentioned explicitly in the problem.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, if a state is unphysical (like in A), it is often considered a typo. If we assume it was a typo for a valid state like `3D1`, the transition would be permitted (as `S=1, L=2, J=1; l_X=1` would satisfy all rules). The question prominently features the Pauli statistics requirement, suggesting that the test is focused on applying this specific rule. Option C is the only one that represents a transition to a physically possible state (`3P0` is valid) but is forbidden specifically by this Pauli principle selection rule. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's extract its quantum numbers. The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   **Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S=0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The spectroscopic notation 'S' corresponds to `L=0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J=0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin (T):** The Pauli exclusion principle must apply to the two-nucleon system. The generalized Pauli principle states that the total wavefunction (spatial, spin, isospin) must be antisymmetric upon exchange of the two identical nucleons. This leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be odd, i.e., `L + S + T = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    For the initial `1S0` state, `L=0` and `S=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_initial = 1 (mod 2)`, which implies `T_initial = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `1S0`: `J=0, P=+1, T=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe initial system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n*   `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`\n\nWe are given several pieces of information and conservation laws must hold.\n\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum with respect to the final NN system is `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, ...).\n*   **Final NN state:** Has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X_orbital) * P(X_intrinsic)`\n    *   `P_final = (-1)^(L_final) * (-1)^(l_X) * (-1)`\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^(L_final + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This equation holds only if the exponent `L_final + l_X + 1` is an even number.\n    *   This implies `L_final + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum vector is conserved.\n    *   `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final)`\n    *   `vec(J(NN_initial)) = vec(J(NN_final)) + vec(j_X)`, where `j_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X.\n    *   Since `J(NN_initial) = 0`, we have `0 = vec(J(NN_final)) + vec(j_X)`.\n    *   This implies `J(NN_final) = j_X` in magnitude.\n    *   The total angular momentum of particle X is `vec(j_X) = vec(l_X) + vec(s_X)`, where `s_X` is the unknown spin of particle X. The magnitude `j_X` must satisfy the triangle inequality `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n    *   A simple and common case in such problems is that X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion, which has `J^P=0-`). If `s_X=0`, then `j_X = l_X`, and the conservation law simplifies to `J(NN_final) = l_X`. We will use this simplified rule, as the result should be independent of the unknown spin `s_X`.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem gives a specific rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this into the rule gives `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This can be rewritten as `S_final + L_final = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_final + L_final = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   So, for the final NN state, the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, `S_final + L_final`, must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Test Each Proposed Transition\n\nLet's check each option against the rules we've established:\n1.  **Pauli Rule:** `S + L` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity Rule:** `L + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Angular Momentum Rule (for `s_X=0`):** `J = l_X`.\n4.  **State Possibility:** We should also note whether the proposed final NN state is physically possible (e.g., `S=0` or `1` for two nucleons).\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATED**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Not permitted due to violation of the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S=3`. `L=2` ('D' state). `J=1`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). An `S=3` state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed.\n*   Conclusion: Not permitted because the final state is impossible.\n*(Note: If we ignored this impossibility and just applied the selection rules, we would find: Pauli: `S+L = 3+2=5` (odd) -> OK. Parity: `L+l_X = 2+1=3` (odd) -> OK. Ang. Mom.: `J=1, l_X=1` -> OK. This is why it's important to recognize unphysical states.)*\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **B)** violates the specific Pauli principle constraint given in the problem.\n*   **C)** involves a final state that is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this type, we are typically expected to find a unique answer by applying the principles mentioned in the problem statement. The question explicitly asks us to use \"Pauli statistics,\" \"conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\" Option B is the only one that fails the Pauli statistics rule as defined in the problem. The issue with option C is the impossibility of the state itself, which is a more fundamental error but might be considered outside the direct application of the specified conservation laws. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that violates the provided rules.\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is forbidden because for the final NN state `3P0` (S=1, L=1) with T=0, the sum `S+L=2` is even, which violates the required condition that `S+L` must be odd.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe code execution has systematically evaluated each proposed reaction against the rules derived from the problem statement. Let's summarize the findings to select the final answer.\n\n### Summary of Rules\nA reaction `1S0 -> NN_f + X` is permitted only if all three conditions are met:\n1.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.\n2.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the final nucleon pair, `J_f`, must equal the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n3.  **Pauli Constraint (for T_f=0):** The sum of the final nucleon pair's spin and orbital angular momentum, `S_f + L_f`, must be an odd number.\n\n### Analysis of Each Option based on Code Output\n\n*   **A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p:** The code shows that this reaction passes all three rules given in the problem. However, the `7D1` state implies a total spin `S=3` for the two-nucleon system, which is physically impossible as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to form `S=0` or `S=1`. So, while it passes the given checklist, it's forbidden on more fundamental grounds.\n*   **B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f:** The code confirms this reaction passes all three rules and describes a physically possible final state. It is a permitted transition.\n*   **C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s:** The code shows that this reaction violates **Rule 3**, the Pauli statistics constraint.\n    *   For the final state `3P0`, we have `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`.\n    *   The sum `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is an **even** number.\n    *   This violates the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be **odd** for a final state with `T(NN)=0`.\n    *   Therefore, this partial wave is **not permitted**.\n*   **D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p:** The code confirms this reaction passes all three rules and is physically possible. It is a permitted transition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe question asks for the partial wave that is **not permitted**. Option C is the only one that violates one of the explicit rules provided in the problem statement (the Pauli constraint). While option A is also forbidden, it's due to a reason outside the specified rules, making option C the most direct and intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` tells us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total initial spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` means the initial orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` means the total initial angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Process:** The system emits a particle X, leading to a final state.\n    *   `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum `L(X)` is given by the lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n### 2. Identify the Relevant Conservation Laws and Principles\nThe problem requires us to use three key principles:\n\n**a) Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n*   The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = J_f_total}`.\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum `J_f_total}` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n*   So, `vec(J_f) + vec(j_X) = 0`. This implies their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n*   The problem does not specify the spin of particle X, `S(X)`. A standard assumption for emitted mesons (like pions) or in such problems when not specified is `S(X)=0`. If `S(X)=0`, then `j_X = L(X)`.\n*   Therefore, the conservation of angular momentum rule is: **`J_f = L(X)`**.\n\n**b) Conservation of Parity (P):**\n*   The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n*   The parity of a composite system is the product of the intrinsic parities of its components multiplied by `(-1)^L`, where L is the relative orbital angular momentum.\n*   **Initial Parity:** `P_i = P(NN_i) = P_n * P_p * (-1)^{L_i}`. Nucleons (protons 'p', neutrons 'n') have intrinsic parity `+1`. `L_i=0`. So, `P_i = (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Final Parity:** `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^{L(X)}`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (+1)(+1)(-1)^{L_f} = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{L(X)} = -(-1)^{L_f + L(X)}`.\n*   Conservation (`P_i = P_f`) means `+1 = -(-1)^{L_f + L(X)}`. This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + L(X)} = -1`.\n*   This implies the exponent must be odd. So, the rule is: **`L_f + L(X)` must be odd**.\n\n**c) Pauli Exclusion Principle for Nucleons:**\n*   The problem states: \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\".\n*   This is equivalent to the fundamental requirement that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric, which means `L+S+T` must be an odd integer.\n*   The problem then asks us to evaluate the options under the specific condition: **`T_f = 0`**.\n*   Substituting `T_f = 0` into the Pauli rule `L_f+S_f+T_f` = odd, we get `L_f+S_f` = odd.\n*   So, for a transition to be allowed under the given condition, the final NN state must satisfy: **`L_f + S_f` must be odd**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nWe will now check each of the four options against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7 -> S_f=3`; `L_f=2` (D-wave); `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **State Validity:** Two nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin can only be `S = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0` (singlet) or `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet). A state with `S_f = 3` (a septet) is impossible for a two-nucleon system. The state `7D1` does not exist for an NN system. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `2S_f+1=3 -> S_f=1`; `L_f=1` (P-wave); `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L(X)=0`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 0`, `L(X) = 0`. Is `J_f = L(X)`? Yes. (OK)\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n    3.  **Pauli Principle (T_f=0):** `L_f + S_f = 1 + 1 = 2`. Is this odd? No, it is even. (VIOLATION)\n*   Since this option violates the Pauli principle for `T_f=0`, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`; `L_f=0`; `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. Is `J_f = L(X)`? Yes. (OK)\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n    3.  **Pauli Principle (T_f=0):** `L_f + S_f = 0 + 1 = 1`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`; `L_f=2`; `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L(X)=3`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 3`, `L(X) = 3`. Is `J_f = L(X)`? Yes. (OK)\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n    3.  **Pauli Principle (T_f=0):** `L_f + S_f = 2 + 1 = 3`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe have identified two forbidden transitions:\n*   **A) is forbidden** because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **B) is forbidden** because it violates the selection rule imposed by the Pauli principle under the problem's condition that `T_f = 0`. The `3P0` state requires `T_f=1`.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must identify the single best answer. The question's structure explicitly provides the Pauli principle rule and asks to evaluate the options assuming `T_f = 0`. This directs the solver to test this specific condition. Option B is the only one that fails this test. The impossibility of state A is due to prior knowledge outside the specific rules laid out in the problem text for the test. The most direct contradiction of the problem's setup is found in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and Establish the Rules\n\nFirst, we must understand the initial state and the rules governing the decay process.\n\n*   **Initial State (1S0):**\n    *   Notation: `(2S+1)L(J)`\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` => Initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Decay Process:** `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`\n\nWe must apply three rules to determine if a transition is permitted. A transition is forbidden if it violates any of these rules.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    *   The initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). (Assuming particle X is spinless, which is standard in such problems).\n    *   To conserve J, the vector sum must be zero: `vec{J_f} + vec{l_X} = 0`. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P_X(intrinsic) * P_X(orbital)`.\n    *   `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `P_i = P_f`, so `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number. Therefore, the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    *   The problem explicitly gives the condition for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. Therefore, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Implicit Rule 4: Validity of Quantum States**\n    *   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other value for spin, such as `S=3` (`2S+1=7`), is physically impossible.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each proposed transition against these rules.\n\n| Option | Reaction | Final NN State (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) | X State (`l_X`) | Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd?) | Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd?) | Ang. Mom. (`J_f=l_X`?) | State Valid (`S` is 0 or 1?) | Permitted? |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| **A)** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | S=1, L=1, J=0 | l=0 | 1 + 1 = 2 (Even) ❌ | 1 + 0 = 1 (Odd) ✔️ | 0 = 0 ✔️ | S=1 ✔️ | **No** |\n| **B)** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | S=1, L=2, J=3 | l=3 | 1 + 2 = 3 (Odd) ✔️ | 2 + 3 = 5 (Odd) ✔️ | 3 = 3 ✔️ | S=1 ✔️ | **Yes** |\n| **C)** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | S=3, L=2, J=1 | l=1 | 3 + 2 = 5 (Odd) ✔️ | 2 + 1 = 3 (Odd) ✔️ | 1 = 1 ✔️ | S=3 ❌ | **No** |\n| **D)** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | S=1, L=0, J=1 | l=1 | 1 + 0 = 1 (Odd) ✔️ | 0 + 1 = 1 (Odd) ✔️ | 1 = 1 ✔️ | S=1 ✔️ | **Yes** |\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted: A and C.\n\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics constraint (`S_f + L_f` must be odd) that was explicitly given in the problem for a final `T=0` state.\n*   **Option C (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is not permitted because the final NN state `7D1` (`S=3`) is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons.\n\nThe question asks which partial wave is not permitted. When two answers are seemingly correct, it's crucial to consider the framing of the question. The problem specifically instructs us to use the provided Pauli rule and conservation laws. Option A is the only choice that violates one of these explicit transition rules. The issue with Option C is the physical impossibility of the final state itself, which is a different class of violation and might even be a typo. The most direct application of the problem's instructions leads to identifying Option A as the forbidden transition.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the initial NN system is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and Particle X\nThe process is `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`. The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`, relative to the final NN system.\n*   **Final NN state (`NN_f`)**: It is described by a term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`. The problem states we should assume its total isospin is `T_{NN_f} = 0`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Governing Rules\nThe reaction must obey several conservation laws and principles. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of them.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics (as given)**\n    The problem provides a specific condition from the generalized Pauli exclusion principle: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are told to assume the final NN state has `T_{NN_f} = 0`. Plugging this into the formula:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**. Any final NN state where `S_f + L_f` is even will violate this condition and is therefore not permitted.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be the same before and after the reaction.\n    `P_i = P_f`\n    `P_i = +1` (from the initial `1S0` state).\n    The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    So, `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n    This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum `J` must be conserved. `J_i = J_f`.\n    `J_i = 0`. So, the total angular momentum of the final system must be `J_f = 0`.\n    The final angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`), the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`), and its spin (`s_X`): `vec{J_f} = vec{J_{NN_f}} + vec{l_X} + vec{s_X}`.\n    For `J_f` to be zero, it must be possible to combine these three vectors to get zero. This is a broad condition, but it can be checked for each case. A simpler check, assuming `s_X=0`, would be `J_{NN_f} = l_X`. We will see if this assumption is necessary.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of States**\n    The quantum states themselves must be physically possible. For a system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions), the total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet).\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's create a table to check each option against the rules.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`S_f, L_f, J_f`) | Particle X (`l_X`) | Rule 1: `S_f+L_f` (must be odd?) | Rule 2: `L_f+l_X` (must be odd?) | Rule 4: `S_f` possible? |\n|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A) `7D1` | S=3, L=2, J=1 | p (l=1) | 3+2 = 5 (**OK**) | 2+1 = 3 (**OK**) | `S=3` (**Forbidden**) |\n| B) `3D3` | S=1, L=2, J=3 | f (l=3) | 1+2 = 3 (**OK**) | 2+3 = 5 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n| C) `3S1` | S=1, L=0, J=1 | p (l=1) | 1+0 = 1 (**OK**) | 0+1 = 1 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n| D) `3P0` | S=1, L=1, J=0 | s (l=0) | 1+1 = 2 (**Forbidden**) | 1+0 = 1 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nFrom the analysis, we find two forbidden reactions:\n\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3` (`2S+1=7`). This is impossible, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`.\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics condition given in the problem. For the final state to have `T=0`, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be odd. For the `3P0` state, `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f + L_f = 2`, which is even.\n\nWhen a multiple-choice question has two seemingly correct answers, it's often because one violates a condition explicitly provided in the problem statement, which is intended to be the primary focus. The problem explicitly gives the Pauli condition and the requirement that `T(NN_f)=0`. Option D is the only one that fails this specific test. The impossibility of state `7D1` in Option A relies on general background knowledge not explicitly written in the problem's rule set. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the test set up by the problem itself.\n\nThe state `3P0` is a valid NN state, but it must have T=1. The problem asks to consider a hypothetical transition to a `T=0` state. Since a `3P0` state cannot have `T=0`, the transition is forbidden.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Conservation Laws\n\nWe need to check which of the proposed reactions is forbidden. A reaction is forbidden if it violates a fundamental conservation law or a given physical principle. The relevant principles here are:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The final two-nucleon (NN) state must be consistent with the Pauli principle. The problem provides a specific condition for this.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   The initial state is a two-nucleon system (NN) in a **1S0** state.\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_initial = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Parity of the initial state:** The parity of a system with orbital angular momentum L is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n    *   `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   The final state consists of the final NN system and the emitted particle X.\n*   The reaction is: `NN_initial (1S0) -> NN_final + X`.\n\n**A. Conservation of Parity**\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_final` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_final`, where `L_final` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n    *   `P(X)_intrinsic = -1` (given in the problem).\n    *   `P(X)_orbital = (-1)^l_X`, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   Putting it together:\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_final + l_X)`\n*   This equation is satisfied only if `(-1)^(L_final + l_X) = -1`, which means the exponent `(L_final + l_X)` must be **odd**.\n\n**B. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n*   `J_initial = J_final`\n*   `J_initial = 0`.\n*   `J_final` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_final(NN)`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`J_X`).\n*   The problem does not specify the spin of particle X. A common simplification in such problems is to assume X is spinless (like a pion). If `s_X = 0`, then `J_X = l_X`.\n*   The total final angular momentum is the vector sum `J_final = J_final(NN) + l_X`.\n*   For `J_final` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_final(NN) = l_X`.\n\n**C. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\n*   The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the following condition must hold:\n    `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`:\n    `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   This implies that `(S_final + L_final)` must be **odd**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each option against these three conditions:\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final` must be odd.\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = l_X`.\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X` must be odd.\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 0`, `J_final(NN) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 1`, `J_final(NN) = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the condition. **FORBIDDEN.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 0`, `l_X = 0`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n---\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final(NN) = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 3`, `l_X = 3`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S_final = 3`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final(NN) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Note:** A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 (antiparallel) or S=1 (parallel). S=3 is physically impossible for this system. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed. However, let's check the transition rules as requested by the problem structure.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: The transition itself obeys all the conservation laws. The reaction is forbidden only because the final product `7D1` is not a possible state for two nucleons.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nComparing the options, option B is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle condition explicitly provided in the problem statement. Option D is forbidden for a different reason: the final state itself is unphysical. In the context of such problems, one should primarily focus on applying the given rules and conservation laws to the transition process. Option B fails one of these explicit checks, making it the most direct and intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system (`NN_i`).\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` denotes the orbital angular momentum, so `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` denotes the total angular momentum, so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The initial system emits a particle X: `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `l_X`.\n        *   `s`: `l_X = 0`\n        *   `p`: `l_X = 1`\n        *   `f`: `l_X = 3`\n\n*   **Final State:** A final two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and particle X.\n    *   The final NN system has isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Selection Rules (Conservation Laws)\n\nWe need to check three conditions for each proposed reaction. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of these rules.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final NN State**\n    *   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN_f) = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this into the rule gives: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation is true only if `S_f + L_f` is an odd number.\n    *   **Condition 1:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    *   The total angular momentum of the initial system (`J_i = 0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final system.\n    *   The final system's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). (We assume particle X has no spin, which is standard for particles like pions denoted by `s, p, ...` states).\n    *   The conservation law is `vec{J_i} = vec{J_f} + vec{l_X}`.\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, this implies `vec{J_f} + vec{l_X} = 0`, which can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n    *   **Condition 2:** `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Parity**\n    *   The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state: `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final state's parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`.\n        *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n        *   `P(X) = -1` (given intrinsic parity).\n        *   `P_orbital = (-1)^{l_X}` (parity from the relative motion of X).\n    *   So, the conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`, or `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n    *   This requires the exponent to be odd.\n    *   **Condition 3:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nNow we apply these three conditions to each of the given reactions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` state): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Check Condition 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   The reaction is not permitted.\n\nSince we have already found a violation, this is the answer. For completeness, let's check the other options.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` state): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` implies `S_f = 3`. A two-nucleon system is made of two spin-1/2 particles, so its total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for two nucleons. Therefore, this reaction is forbidden because the final state cannot exist.\n*   However, if we mechanically apply the selection rules as requested:\n    *   `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n    *   `l_X = 1`.\n    *   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n    *   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n    *   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n*   The process itself obeys all the given selection rules, but it leads to an impossible state. The question asks which *partial wave* is not permitted based on the given rules. Option A is the only one that violates one of those rules directly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state, which requires `S_f + L_f` to be odd. In this case, `1 + 1 = 2`, which is even.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers for this state:\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that the sum `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where T is the isospin. For the initial state, we have `L_i = 0` and `S_i = 0`, so `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This requires the isospin of the initial state to be `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, for the initial state `1S0`: `J_i = 0`, `P_i = +1`, `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: It has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. The problem does not specify the spin of X. A common particle emitted in such decays is a pion (π), which has spin `S_X = 0`. We will assume `S_X = 0`, which is standard for this type of problem unless specified otherwise. The orbital angular momentum of X is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`), which corresponds to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3` respectively.\n*   **Final NN state**: It has isospin `T_f = 0`. Its quantum numbers are given by the term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n\nWe must check three conservation laws and one statistical rule:\n\n**A. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle X's total angular momentum `J_X`. `vec{J}_{final} = vec{J}_f + vec{J}_X`.\n*   With `S_X = 0`, `vec{J}_X = vec{l}_X + vec{S}_X = vec{l}_X`, so `J_X = l_X`.\n*   For `vec{J}_{final}` to be zero, we must be able to couple `vec{J}_f` and `vec{l}_X` to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**B. Conservation of Parity:**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the final particles and the parity from their relative orbital motion: `P_{final} = P_{NN_f} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n*   `P_{NN_f} = (-1)^{L_f}` and `P_X = -1`.\n*   So, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n*   For this equation to hold, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**C. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\nThe problem explicitly states the condition from Pauli statistics: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n*   This, in turn, implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\nA transition is \"not permitted\" if it violates any of these three conditions.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each of the proposed final states against our three conditions.\n\n| Option | Reaction               | Final NN State (`L_f`, `S_f`, `J_f`) | X State (`l_X`) | **Pauli?** (`S_f+L_f` odd) | **Parity?** (`L_f+l_X` odd) | **Ang.

Although it satisfies the conservation of angular momentum and parity, it violates the Pauli principle for the final two-nucleon state. For the final state `3P0`, we have `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f + L_f = 2` (even). According to the Pauli principle for a `T_f=0` state, `S_f + L_f` must be odd. Therefore, a `3P0` state with `T=0` cannot exist for a two-nucleon system, and the transition is forbidden.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe system starts as a bound state of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`, we have `2S+1 = 1`, which means the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` means the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n*   The particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The particle X is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X`. The lowercase letters denote this: `s` (l=0), `p` (l=1), `d` (l=2), `f` (l=3).\n*   The final NN state has quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must apply three conservation laws and constraints:\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state is `J_i = 0`. The total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the total to be conserved (`J_final = J_i = 0`), we must have `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:**\n    The parity of the initial state is `P_i = +1`. The parity of the final state is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(relative motion)`.\n    `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that `T_f = 0`. Substituting this in, we get:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This equation holds if and only if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against the three derived conditions:\n1.  `J_f = l_X`\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd\n\n| Option | Reaction               | NN Final State (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) | X State (`l_X`) | `J_f = l_X`? | `L_f + l_X` is odd? | `S_f + L_f` is odd? | Permitted? |\n| :----: | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------- | :------------------ | :------------------ | :--------- |\n| **A)** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`       | S=1, L=1, J=0                        | l=0             | 0 = 0 (Yes)  | 1 + 0 = 1 (Yes)     | 1 + 1 = 2 (**No**)  | **No**     |\n| **B)** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`       | S=1, L=2, J=3                        | l=3             | 3 = 3 (Yes)  | 2 + 3 = 5 (Yes)     | 1 + 2 = 3 (Yes)     | Yes        |\n| **C)** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`       | S=3, L=2, J=1                        | l=1             | 1 = 1 (Yes)  | 2 + 1 = 3 (Yes)     | 3 + 2 = 5 (Yes)     | Yes*       |\n| **D)** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`       | S=1, L=0, J=1                        | l=1             | 1 = 1 (Yes)  | 0 + 1 = 1 (Yes)     | 1 + 0 = 1 (Yes)     | Yes        |\n\n\\*Note on Option C: The final state `7D1` implies a spin `S=3` for the two-nucleon system. Since nucleons are spin-1/2 particles, their total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. Thus, the state `7D1` is physically impossible. However, when strictly applying the rules *given in the problem*, this transition is formally allowed. The question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave based on the provided conservation laws and Pauli condition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, reaction A is the only one that violates one of the conditions explicitly derived from the problem statement. It fails the Pauli statistics requirement that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` final state.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers using the notation `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is 'S' => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is '0' => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe intrinsic parity of the initial NN system is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nThe generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule: `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, where `T` is the total isospin. For the initial `1S0` state (`L_i=0, S_i=0`), we have `(-1)^(0+0+T_i) = -1`, which means `(-1)^(T_i) = -1`. This requires `T_i` to be odd. The lowest possible value is `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nThe system decays as `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must apply several rules to determine if a transition is permitted.\n\n**Constraint 1: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt also specifies that the final NN state has `T(NN, final) = 0`.\nSubstituting `T=0` into the given rule:\n`0 = S(NN, final) + L(NN, final) + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis means that `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final) + 1` must be an even number.\nThis is equivalent to requiring `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final)` to be an **odd** number.\n\n**Constraint 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n`J_i = J_f`\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\nThe final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system, `J(NN, final)`, and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `L(X)`.\nSo, `J_f = J(NN, final) + L(X)`.\nFor `J_f` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN, final) = L(X)`.\n\n**Constraint 3: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity `P` must be conserved.\n`P_i = P_f`\nThe initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\nThe final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN, final) * P(X) * (-1)^(L(X))`.\n*   `P(NN, final) = (-1)^(L(NN, final))`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `(-1)^(L(X))` is the parity associated with the relative orbital motion of X.\n\nSo, the conservation equation is:\n`+1 = (-1)^(L(NN, final)) * (-1) * (-1)^(L(X))`\n`+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN, final) + L(X))`\n`-1 = (-1)^(L(NN, final) + L(X))`\nThis requires the exponent `L(NN, final) + L(X)` to be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\nWe now apply these three constraints to each proposed final state. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these constraints. The lowercase letters (s, p, f) denote `L(X)`: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L(X)=0`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). The sum must be odd. **This rule is VIOLATED.**\n*   Constraint 2 (J conservation): `J(NN)=0`, `L(X)=0`. `0=0`. (Satisfied).\n*   Constraint 3 (P conservation): `L(NN) + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nSince the Pauli principle is violated, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L(X)=3`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 2 (J conservation):** `J(NN)=3`, `L(X)=3`. `3=3`. (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 3 (P conservation):** `L(NN) + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: This notation implies `2S+1=7`, which means `S=3`.\n*   A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their spins can only combine to a total spin `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). It is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system to have `S=3`.\n*   Therefore, the final state `7D1` does not exist for this system, and the transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 2 (J conservation):** `J(NN)=1`, `L(X)=1`. `1=1`. (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 3 (P conservation):** `L(NN) + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe have identified two \"not permitted\" transitions:\n*   A) is not permitted because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final state.\n*   C) is not permitted because the proposed final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, a physically impossible state like `7D1` is almost always a typo. The question is designed to test the application of conservation laws and symmetry principles to the dynamics of the decay. Option A represents a transition between two valid states that is forbidden by one of these specific principles given in the problem. This is a much more likely intended answer than one that relies on identifying a typo. Assuming `C` was a typo for a valid state like `3D1` (which would be a permitted transition), then `A` is the unique answer that is not permitted due to the violation of the physical laws governing the interaction.\n\nTherefore, the intended answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => The total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` => The initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` => The total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`. This is consistent since `J_i` must be between `|L_i - S_i|` and `L_i + S_i`, which is just 0.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Reaction and Final State\nThe reaction is the emission of a particle X: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`, is denoted by a lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN State:** Represented by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n*   **Final System:** `NN(final) + X`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nWe need to check three conditions for the reaction to be permitted.\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n*   `J_initial` = `J_i` = 0.\n*   `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`. So, `J_final` can range from `|J_f - l_X|` to `J_f + l_X`.\n*   For `J_final` to be equal to `J_initial = 0`, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    **`J_f = l_X`** (C1)\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n*   `P_initial` = Parity of the NN(1S0) state = `(-1)^L_i` = `(-1)^0` = `+1`.\n*   `P_final` = `P_NN(final) * P_X(emitted)`.\n    *   `P_NN(final)` = `(-1)^L_f`.\n    *   `P_X(emitted)` = `P_X(intrinsic) * (-1)^l_X` = `(-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   The conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X` = `(-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This implies that:\n    **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.** (C2)\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem provides a specific constraint derived from the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state, assuming its total isospin is `T_f = 0`.\n*   Given: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   Substituting `T_f = 0`: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This can be rearranged to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This means that:\n    **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.** (C3)\n\nA reaction is \"not permitted\" if it violates at least one of these three conditions.\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (3S1): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (p): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Check Conditions:\n    *   C1: `J_f = l_X`?  => `1 = 1`.

Two nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions, so their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). It is impossible for two nucleons to form an `S=3` state. Therefore, this reaction is not permitted because the final state cannot exist.

(**✗**)\n*   **Result: Not permitted.** This reaction violates the Pauli statistics constraint given in the problem statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have identified two forbidden reactions:\n*   **C** is forbidden because the final NN state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **D** is forbidden because it violates one of the specific rules provided in the question (the Pauli constraint).\n\nThe question asks us to identify the non-permitted partial wave by making use of the conservation laws and the specific Pauli statistics rule. Reaction D is the one that is disallowed specifically by these rules. Reaction C is disallowed for a more fundamental reason (the composition of the NN system) that precedes the application of the reaction rules. Therefore, the most direct answer to the question as posed is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_initial + 1 = 1`  => `S_initial = 0` (Total spin of the two nucleons is 0, a singlet state).\n*   `L = S` => `L_initial = 0` (Total orbital angular momentum of the two nucleons is 0).\n*   `J = 0` => `J_initial = 0` (Total angular momentum of the initial NN system).\n*   **Parity of the initial NN state (`P_initial_NN`)**: The parity of a two-particle system is given by `(-1)^L`. So, `P_initial_NN = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`. We need to check several rules for each proposed final state.\n\n*   **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**: The problem explicitly states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are also given that the final state has isospin `T_final = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T_final = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_final + L_final + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_final + L_final` must be an **odd number**. This is a critical selection rule for the final NN state.\n\n*   **Parity Conservation**: The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `P_initial_total = P_final_total`\n    *   `P_initial_total` is the parity of the initial `1S0` NN state, which is `+1`.\n    *   `P_final_total = P_final_NN * P_X * P_orbital`.\n        *   `P_final_NN = (-1)^L_final` (parity of the final NN internal state).\n        *   `P_X = -1` (intrinsic parity of particle X, given).\n        *   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the relative motion between X and the final NN system, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of X).\n    *   The conservation equation is: `+1 = ((-1)^L_final) * (-1) * ((-1)^l_X)`.\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^(L_final + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This implies that the exponent `L_final + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `L_final + l_X` must be an **odd number**.\n\n*   **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial_total = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_initial_total = J_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the angular momenta in the final state: the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_final`) and the total angular momentum of particle X.\n    *   The total angular momentum of X is `j_X`, which is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `s_X`.\n    *   The conservation law is `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final) + vec(j_X)` or `0 = vec(J_final) + vec(l_X) + vec(s_X)`.\n    *   This means the three vectors `vec(J_final)`, `vec(l_X)`, and `vec(s_X)` must form a closed triangle (their vector sum is zero). A consequence of this is the triangle inequality: `|J_final - l_X| <= s_X <= J_final + l_X`.\n    *   A common simplification occurs if particle X is spinless (`s_X=0`), like a pion (`π`). In that case, `vec(J_final) + vec(l_X) = 0`, which implies `J_final = l_X`. We will check this simpler case first, but the general case allows for a range of `s_X`.\n\n*   **Fundamental Constraints on NN states**: A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). Any other value of S is impossible.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these rules. The final state is `(2S+1)L(J) + l_X`.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_final=1`, `L_final=2`, `J_final=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S=1` is a valid spin for an NN system.\n    2.  **Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)**: `1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n    3.  **Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)**: `2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n    4.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_final=3`, `l_X=3`. We need `|3 - 3| <= s_X <= 3 + 3`, so `0 <= s_X <= 6`. This is possible if X has spin `s_X` in this range (e.g., `s_X=0, 1, 2, ...`).\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S_final=3`. `L_final=2`, `J_final=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S_final=3` is **not possible** for a two-nucleon system. The maximum spin is `1/2 + 1/2 = 1`.\n*   Conclusion: **Not Permitted**. The final NN state is unphysical.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_final=1`, `L_final=0`, `J_final=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S=1` is valid.\n    2.  **Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)**: `1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n    3.  **Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)**: `0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n    4.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_final=1`, `l_X=1`. We need `|1 - 1| <= s_X <= 1 + 1`, so `0 <= s_X <= 2`. This is possible if X has spin `s_X=0, 1, or 2`.\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_final=1`, `L_final=1`, `J_final=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S=1` is valid.\n    2.  **Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)**: `1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_final+L_final` must be odd for `T_final=0`.\n    3.  **Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)**: `1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n    4.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_final=0`, `l_X=0`. We need `|0 - 0| <= s_X <= 0 + 0`, so `s_X = 0`. This is only possible if particle X has spin 0.\n*   Conclusion: **Not Permitted**. This violates the generalized Pauli principle as specified in the problem.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have identified two \"not permitted\" reactions: B and D.\n*   **B is not permitted** because the proposed final state (`7D1`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   **D is not permitted** because it violates the specific selection rule (`T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`) that the problem instructed us to use for a `T_final=0` state.\n\nSince the problem explicitly provides the Pauli statistics rule and the condition `T(NN)=0`, it is highly probable that the question is designed to test the application of this specific rule. Option D is the one that fails this test. While option B is also impossible, it's due to a more fundamental property of nucleons not explicitly mentioned in the problem prompt. The key violation in D relates directly to the information provided.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0` (singlet state).\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State\nThe final state consists of the NN system and an emitted particle X.\n`NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN system is `l_X`, denoted by the lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n    *   Unless specified otherwise, we can assume particle X is spinless (`s_X = 0`), so its total angular momentum is `j_X = l_X`.\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   Its quantum numbers are denoted `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f`.\n    *   We are given that its total isospin is `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Its parity is `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n\n### 3. Apply the Conservation Laws and Given Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for each potential reaction:\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's angular momentum (`j_X`).\n*   `J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum).\n*   Since `J_i = 0`, `J_f` and `j_X` must be coupled to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n*   Assuming `s_X = 0`, we have `j_X = l_X`. So, the condition simplifies to **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities and the orbital parity: `P_f(total) = P_f(NN) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n*   `P(orbital)` is the parity associated with the relative orbital motion of the final particles, which is `(-1)^(l_X)`.\n*   So, `P_f(total) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   The conservation law is `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   This implies the exponent must be even: `L_f + l_X + 1 = 2n`.\n*   This simplifies to the condition that **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states a specific requirement for the final NN state:\n*   `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   We are given `T_f = 0`.\n*   So, `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   For this equation to hold, `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n*   This means **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f = 3` (from `2S+1=7`), `L_f = 2` (D), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `1 = 1`.

(Note: A `7D1` state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, but it passes the specific rules we were asked to check.)\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `3 = 3`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `0 = 0`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. **(✗ This is an even number, which violates the condition.)**\n*   This reaction is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final state.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n### 1.

The reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of X is denoted by `l_X` (where s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n    *   We assume particle X is a meson (like a pion), which has intrinsic spin `s_X = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** A final NN state described by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` and particle X.\n    *   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Conservation Laws and Selection Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for the transition to be permitted:\n\n**a) Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n*   Since we assume `s_X=0`, `j_X = l_X`.\n*   So, `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n*   For `J_i = 0`, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**b) Conservation of Parity (P):**\n*   The initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is `P_f = P_f(NN) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n*   `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n*   `P_intrinsic(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^(l_X)`.\n*   So, `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n*   For parity to be conserved, `P_i = P_f`, so `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n*   This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n**c) Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final State:**\n*   The problem provides the rule for the final NN state: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This means `T_f` and `S_f + L_f + 1` must have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n*   The problem states that we must suppose `T_f = 0` (even).\n*   Therefore, `S_f + L_f + 1` must also be even.\n*   For `S_f + L_f + 1` to be even, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n### 3.

Analyze the Initial State and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system.\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   Initial parity `P_i` depends on the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction:** `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   A particle `X` with intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` is emitted.\n    *   The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes the orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `l_x`.\n    *   s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3.\n\n*   **Final State:** The final NN state `NN(final)` has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n**2. Identify the Governing Rules (Conservation Laws and Statistics)**\n\nWe need to check three conditions for any potential reaction to be allowed.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_x`). For the initial and final total angular momenta to be equal:\n    `J_i = J_f + l_x` (vector sum)\n    `0 = J_f + l_x`\n    This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_x`.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be conserved. The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_x`\n    So, the conservation equation is: `P_i = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x`.\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`\n    For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_x + 1` must be an even number. This implies that the sum `L_f + l_x` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that `T_f = 0`. Substituting this into the rule:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This simplifies to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Therefore, the sum of the final spin and final orbital angular momentum, `S_f + L_f`, must be **odd**.\n\n**3. Test Each Option Against the Rules**\n\nWe will check each option to see if it violates any of these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_x=1`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **L_f + l_x = odd?** `2 + 1 = 3`. (OK)\n3.  **S_f + L_f = odd?** `3 + 2 = 5`. (OK)\n    *This transition appears allowed by the rules of the decay process. However, the state `7D1` requires `S=3`. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, making the transition forbidden.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_x=1`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **L_f + l_x = odd?** `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **S_f + L_f = odd?** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n    *This transition is permitted by all rules.*\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_x=3`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **L_f + l_x = odd?** `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **S_f + L_f = odd?** `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n    *This transition is permitted by all rules.*\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_x=0`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **L_f + l_x = odd?** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **S_f + L_f = odd?** `1 + 1 = 2`. (VIOLATED)\n    *The sum `S_f + L_f` is even, which violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final state.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe transition in option D) violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly provided in the question for a final state with `T(NN)=0`. Although the final state in option A) is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons, option D) is the one that fails the specific calculation based on the given constraints of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L_J`:\n*   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is 'S', which corresponds to orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is 0, so the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nFrom these quantum numbers, we can determine the parity and isospin of the initial state.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of a system with orbital angular momentum `L` is `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin:** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two identical nucleons states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts.\n    *   Antisymmetry `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1` which implies `L+S+T` must be odd.\n    *   For the initial `1S0` state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which means the initial isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `J_i=0`, `P_i=+1`, `T_i=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system `(NN)_f` and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. It is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN State:** Described by `(2S_f+1)L_f_{J_f}`. The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n\nWe must apply the following rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum `J_i=0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`. So, `vec(J_f) + vec(l_X) = 0`, which implies `J_f = l_X`.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity `P_i=+1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN parity `P_f(NN) = (-1)^{L_f}`, the intrinsic parity of X `P(X)=-1`, and the orbital parity of X's motion `(-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `(-1)^{L_f+l_X+1} = +1`. This means `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even, or `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** The problem states the rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN)` must be odd.\n    *   Given `T_f(NN)=0`, the rule simplifies to `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n4.  **Validity of the Final State:** For a two-nucleon system, the total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). This means `2S_f+1` can only be 1 or 3.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state: `7D1`. This means `2S_f+1=7`, so `S_f=3`.\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=3` is impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is not permitted.**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is permitted.**\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `0 = 0`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(Violation)**\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is not permitted.**\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `3 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is permitted.**\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have found two forbidden transitions:\n*   A is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   C is forbidden because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final state, which is a key selection rule mentioned explicitly in the problem.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, if a state is unphysical (like in A), it is often considered a typo. If we assume it was a typo for a valid state like `3D1`, the transition would be permitted (as `S=1, L=2, J=1; l_X=1` would satisfy all rules). The question prominently features the Pauli statistics requirement, suggesting that the test is focused on applying this specific rule. Option C is the only one that represents a transition to a physically possible state (`3P0` is valid) but is forbidden specifically by this Pauli principle selection rule. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's extract its quantum numbers. The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   **Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S=0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The spectroscopic notation 'S' corresponds to `L=0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J=0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin (T):** The Pauli exclusion principle must apply to the two-nucleon system. The generalized Pauli principle states that the total wavefunction (spatial, spin, isospin) must be antisymmetric upon exchange of the two identical nucleons. This leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be odd, i.e., `L + S + T = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    For the initial `1S0` state, `L=0` and `S=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_initial = 1 (mod 2)`, which implies `T_initial = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `1S0`: `J=0, P=+1, T=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe initial system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n*   `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`\n\nWe are given several pieces of information and conservation laws must hold.\n\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum with respect to the final NN system is `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, ...).\n*   **Final NN state:** Has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X_orbital) * P(X_intrinsic)`\n    *   `P_final = (-1)^(L_final) * (-1)^(l_X) * (-1)`\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^(L_final + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This equation holds only if the exponent `L_final + l_X + 1` is an even number.\n    *   This implies `L_final + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum vector is conserved.\n    *   `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final)`\n    *   `vec(J(NN_initial)) = vec(J(NN_final)) + vec(j_X)`, where `j_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X.\n    *   Since `J(NN_initial) = 0`, we have `0 = vec(J(NN_final)) + vec(j_X)`.\n    *   This implies `J(NN_final) = j_X` in magnitude.\n    *   The total angular momentum of particle X is `vec(j_X) = vec(l_X) + vec(s_X)`, where `s_X` is the unknown spin of particle X. The magnitude `j_X` must satisfy the triangle inequality `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n    *   A simple and common case in such problems is that X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion, which has `J^P=0-`). If `s_X=0`, then `j_X = l_X`, and the conservation law simplifies to `J(NN_final) = l_X`. We will use this simplified rule, as the result should be independent of the unknown spin `s_X`.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem gives a specific rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this into the rule gives `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This can be rewritten as `S_final + L_final = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_final + L_final = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   So, for the final NN state, the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, `S_final + L_final`, must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Test Each Proposed Transition\n\nLet's check each option against the rules we've established:\n1.  **Pauli Rule:** `S + L` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity Rule:** `L + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Angular Momentum Rule (for `s_X=0`):** `J = l_X`.\n4.  **State Possibility:** We should also note whether the proposed final NN state is physically possible (e.g., `S=0` or `1` for two nucleons).\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATED**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Not permitted due to violation of the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S=3`. `L=2` ('D' state). `J=1`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). An `S=3` state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed.\n*   Conclusion: Not permitted because the final state is impossible.\n*(Note: If we ignored this impossibility and just applied the selection rules, we would find: Pauli: `S+L = 3+2=5` (odd) -> OK. Parity: `L+l_X = 2+1=3` (odd) -> OK. Ang. Mom.: `J=1, l_X=1` -> OK. This is why it's important to recognize unphysical states.)*\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **B)** violates the specific Pauli principle constraint given in the problem.\n*   **C)** involves a final state that is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this type, we are typically expected to find a unique answer by applying the principles mentioned in the problem statement. The question explicitly asks us to use \"Pauli statistics,\" \"conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\" Option B is the only one that fails the Pauli statistics rule as defined in the problem. The issue with option C is the impossibility of the state itself, which is a more fundamental error but might be considered outside the direct application of the specified conservation laws. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that violates the provided rules.\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is forbidden because for the final NN state `3P0` (S=1, L=1) with T=0, the sum `S+L=2` is even, which violates the required condition that `S+L` must be odd.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe code execution has systematically evaluated each proposed reaction against the rules derived from the problem statement. Let's summarize the findings to select the final answer.\n\n### Summary of Rules\nA reaction `1S0 -> NN_f + X` is permitted only if all three conditions are met:\n1.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.\n2.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the final nucleon pair, `J_f`, must equal the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n3.  **Pauli Constraint (for T_f=0):** The sum of the final nucleon pair's spin and orbital angular momentum, `S_f + L_f`, must be an odd number.\n\n### Analysis of Each Option based on Code Output\n\n*   **A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p:** The code shows that this reaction passes all three rules given in the problem. However, the `7D1` state implies a total spin `S=3` for the two-nucleon system, which is physically impossible as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to form `S=0` or `S=1`. So, while it passes the given checklist, it's forbidden on more fundamental grounds.\n*   **B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f:** The code confirms this reaction passes all three rules and describes a physically possible final state. It is a permitted transition.\n*   **C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s:** The code shows that this reaction violates **Rule 3**, the Pauli statistics constraint.\n    *   For the final state `3P0`, we have `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`.\n    *   The sum `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is an **even** number.\n    *   This violates the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be **odd** for a final state with `T(NN)=0`.\n    *   Therefore, this partial wave is **not permitted**.\n*   **D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p:** The code confirms this reaction passes all three rules and is physically possible. It is a permitted transition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe question asks for the partial wave that is **not permitted**. Option C is the only one that violates one of the explicit rules provided in the problem statement (the Pauli constraint). While option A is also forbidden, it's due to a reason outside the specified rules, making option C the most direct and intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` tells us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total initial spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` means the initial orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` means the total initial angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Process:** The system emits a particle X, leading to a final state.\n    *   `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum `L(X)` is given by the lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n### 2. Identify the Relevant Conservation Laws and Principles\nThe problem requires us to use three key principles:\n\n**a) Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n*   The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = J_f_total}`.\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum `J_f_total}` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n*   So, `vec(J_f) + vec(j_X) = 0`. This implies their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n*   The problem does not specify the spin of particle X, `S(X)`. A standard assumption for emitted mesons (like pions) or in such problems when not specified is `S(X)=0`. If `S(X)=0`, then `j_X = L(X)`.\n*   Therefore, the conservation of angular momentum rule is: **`J_f = L(X)`**.\n\n**b) Conservation of Parity (P):**\n*   The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n*   The parity of a composite system is the product of the intrinsic parities of its components multiplied by `(-1)^L`, where L is the relative orbital angular momentum.\n*   **Initial Parity:** `P_i = P(NN_i) = P_n * P_p * (-1)^{L_i}`. Nucleons (protons 'p', neutrons 'n') have intrinsic parity `+1`. `L_i=0`. So, `P_i = (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Final Parity:** `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^{L(X)}`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (+1)(+1)(-1)^{L_f} = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{L(X)} = -(-1)^{L_f + L(X)}`.\n*   Conservation (`P_i = P_f`) means `+1 = -(-1)^{L_f + L(X)}`. This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + L(X)} = -1`.\n*   This implies the exponent must be odd. So, the rule is: **`L_f + L(X)` must be odd**.\n\n**c) Pauli Exclusion Principle for Nucleons:**\n*   The problem states: \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\".\n*   This is equivalent to the fundamental requirement that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric, which means `L+S+T` must be an odd integer.\n*   The problem then asks us to evaluate the options under the specific condition: **`T_f = 0`**.\n*   Substituting `T_f = 0` into the Pauli rule `L_f+S_f+T_f` = odd, we get `L_f+S_f` = odd.\n*   So, for a transition to be allowed under the given condition, the final NN state must satisfy: **`L_f + S_f` must be odd**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nWe will now check each of the four options against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7 -> S_f=3`; `L_f=2` (D-wave); `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **State Validity:** Two nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin can only be `S = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0` (singlet) or `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet). A state with `S_f = 3` (a septet) is impossible for a two-nucleon system. The state `7D1` does not exist for an NN system. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `2S_f+1=3 -> S_f=1`; `L_f=1` (P-wave); `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L(X)=0`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 0`, `L(X) = 0`. Is `J_f = L(X)`? Yes. (OK)\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n    3.  **Pauli Principle (T_f=0):** `L_f + S_f = 1 + 1 = 2`. Is this odd? No, it is even.

(OK)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe have identified two forbidden transitions:\n*   **A) is forbidden** because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **B) is forbidden** because it violates the selection rule imposed by the Pauli principle under the problem's condition that `T_f = 0`. The `3P0` state requires `T_f=1`.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must identify the single best answer. The question's structure explicitly provides the Pauli principle rule and asks to evaluate the options assuming `T_f = 0`. This directs the solver to test this specific condition. Option B is the only one that fails this test. The impossibility of state A is due to prior knowledge outside the specific rules laid out in the problem text for the test. The most direct contradiction of the problem's setup is found in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
