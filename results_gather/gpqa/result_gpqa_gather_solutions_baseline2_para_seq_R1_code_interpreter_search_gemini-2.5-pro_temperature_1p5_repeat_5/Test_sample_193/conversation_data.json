Each spin can take values +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the formula E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]. The partition function is defined as Z = Σ_states exp(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n\nFirst, we need to list all possible states of the system and calculate the energy for each state. A state is defined by the triplet (S1, S2, S3). Since each spin has 2 possible values, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states in total.\n\nLet's list the 8 states and calculate the corresponding energy E for each:\n1.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n2.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n3.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n4.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n5.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n6.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n7.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n8.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nNow, we group the states by their energy levels to find the degeneracy of each level.\n-   Energy Level E1 = -3J:\n    This energy corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n-   Energy Level E2 = J:\n    This energy corresponds to the states (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    The degeneracy for this energy level is g2 = 6.\n\nThe total number of states is g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states of the term exp(-βE). We can write this as a sum over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * exp(-β * E1) + g2 * exp(-β * E2)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy reasoning has led to the correct result, and the python code has successfully verified it.\n\nThe system has two energy levels:\n1.  **E1 = -3J**: This occurs when all three spins are aligned (S1=S2=S3=+1 or S1=S2=S3=-1). There are 2 such states (degeneracy g1 = 2). The contribution to the partition function from these states is `2 * e^(-β * -3J) = 2e^(3Jβ)`.\n2.  **E2 = +J**: This occurs when two spins are aligned and one is anti-aligned. There are 6 such states (degeneracy g2 = 6). The contribution to the partition function from these states is `6 * e^(-β * J) = 6e^(-Jβ)`.\n\nThe total partition function Z is the sum of these contributions:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3, each taking values +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\n**1. Understanding the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function (Z) in statistical mechanics is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible microstates of the system.\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\nSince multiple states can have the same energy, we can rewrite the sum over the distinct energy levels, multiplying each Boltzmann factor by the number of states (degeneracy, g) that have that energy:\nZ = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n\n**2. Identifying the Microstates and their Energies**\n\nThe system has three spins, each with two possible values (+1, -1). The total number of microstates is 2³ = 8. We need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states. We can group the states by their configuration.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State 1: (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n        E₁ = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   State 2: (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n        E₂ = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   So, we have **2 states** with an energy of **-3J**. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   This includes states like (+1, +1, -1) and (-1, -1, +1). Let's calculate the energy for one such state, (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = +J\n    *   By symmetry, all states with one spin different from the other two will have the same energy. Let's list them:\n        1.  (+1, +1, -1)\n        2.  (+1, -1, +1)\n        3.  (-1, +1, +1)\n        4.  (-1, -1, +1)\n        5.  (-1, +1, -1)\n        6.  (+1, -1, -1)\n    *   There are **6 states** with an energy of **+J**. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe provided Python code output confirms this analysis:\n*   Energy E = -3J has a degeneracy g = 2.\n*   Energy E = +J has a degeneracy g = 6.\n\n**3. Calculating the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow we sum the contributions from the two distinct energy levels:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**4.

We need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states using the given energy formula:\nE = -J[ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n\nTo simplify, let's categorize the states based on their spin configurations.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This category includes two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   For the state (+1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n    *   For the state (-1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n    So, there are **2 states** with an energy level of E₁ = -3J. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This category includes the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 states. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, for example, (+1, +1, -1).\n    *   For the state (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J [ -1 ] = **+J**\n    By symmetry, all 6 states where one spin is different from the other two will have the same energy. These states are:\n    (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)\n    (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1)\n    So, there are **6 states** with an energy level of E₂ = +J. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n**3. Constructing the Partition Function**\nNow we can calculate the total partition function Z by summing the contributions from the two distinct energy levels we found.\n\nZ = (degeneracy of level 1) * e^(-β * Energy 1) + (degeneracy of level 2) * e^(-β * Energy 2)\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\nLet's compare our result with the choices provided:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated expression, Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Each spin can take values +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the formula E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]. The partition function is defined as Z = Σ_states exp(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n\nFirst, we need to list all possible states of the system and calculate the energy for each state. A state is defined by the triplet (S1, S2, S3). Since each spin has 2 possible values, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states in total.\n\nLet's list the 8 states and calculate the corresponding energy E for each:\n1.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n2.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n3.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n4.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n5.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n6.

State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n8.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nNow, we group the states by their energy levels to find the degeneracy of each level.\n-   Energy Level E1 = -3J:\n    This energy corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n-   Energy Level E2 = J:\n    This energy corresponds to the states (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    The degeneracy for this energy level is g2 = 6.\n\nThe total number of states is g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states of the term exp(-βE). We can write this as a sum over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * exp(-β * E1) + g2 * exp(-β * E2)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy reasoning has led to the correct result, and the python code has successfully verified it.\n\nThe system has two energy levels:\n1.  **E1 = -3J**: This occurs when all three spins are aligned (S1=S2=S3=+1 or S1=S2=S3=-1).

There are 6 such states (degeneracy g2 = 6). The contribution to the partition function from these states is `6 * e^(-β * J) = 6e^(-Jβ)`.\n\nThe total partition function Z is the sum of these contributions:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3, each taking values +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\n**1. Understanding the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function (Z) in statistical mechanics is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible microstates of the system.\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\nSince multiple states can have the same energy, we can rewrite the sum over the distinct energy levels, multiplying each Boltzmann factor by the number of states (degeneracy, g) that have that energy:\nZ = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n\n**2. Identifying the Microstates and their Energies**\n\nThe system has three spins, each with two possible values (+1, -1). The total number of microstates is 2³ = 8. We need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states. We can group the states by their configuration.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State 1: (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n        E₁ = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   State 2: (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n        E₂ = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   So, we have **2 states** with an energy of **-3J**. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   This includes states like (+1, +1, -1) and (-1, -1, +1). Let's calculate the energy for one such state, (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = +J\n    *   By symmetry, all states with one spin different from the other two will have the same energy.

It is useful to first calculate the sum term (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3).\n\n*   **State 1: (+1, +1, +1)**\n    Sum = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: (+1, +1, -1)**\n    Sum = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 3: (+1, -1, +1)**\n    Sum = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 4: (-1, +1, +1)**\n    Sum = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 5: (+1, -1, -1)**\n    Sum = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 6: (-1, +1, -1)**\n    Sum = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 7: (-1, -1, +1)**\n    Sum = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = +J\n\n*   **State 8: (-1, -1, -1)**\n    Sum = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n\n### **4. Group States by Energy Level (Degeneracy)**\nWe can see that there are only two distinct energy levels in the system.\n\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J:**\n    This energy occurs for states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy, g₁) is 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E₂ = +J:**\n    This energy occurs for the other 6 states.\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy, g₂) is 6.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Partition Function (Z)**\nThe partition function is the sum over all states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/kT. We can write this sum by grouping the states with the same energy:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\n\nSubstituting the energy levels and their degeneracies:\nZ = (g₁ * e^(-βE₁)) + (g₂ * e^(-βE₂))\nZ = (2 * e^(-β(-3J))) + (6 * e^(-β(+J)))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe code execution has completed and its output confirms the results of the manual calculation performed in the previous step.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n1.  **States and Energy Levels:** The system has 8 possible microstates.

There are **2** such states. (Degeneracy g₁ = 2).\n    *   **Energy E₂ = +J**: This occurs when one spin is different from the other two (two up & one down, or one up & two down). There are **6** such states. (Degeneracy g₂ = 6).\n3.  **Partition Function Calculation:** The partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, weighted by their degeneracy:\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nB) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\nD) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\n\nOur result matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe problem asks for the partition function Z of a system with three spins, S1, S2, and S3, each taking values +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]. The partition function is defined as Z = Σ_states exp(-βE), where the sum is over all possible states of the system and β = 1/(kT).\n\nFirst, let's identify all possible states and calculate their corresponding energies. There are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations for the three spins.\n\nWe can group the states by the number of spins pointing up (+1) and down (-1). Let's calculate the term X = S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 for each type of configuration. The energy will then be E = -JX.\n\n**Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1):\n    X = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n    E = -3J.\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1):\n    X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n    E = -3J.\n\nThere are 2 states with energy E = -3J. The contribution to the partition function from these states is 2 * exp(-β(-3J)) = 2 * exp(3Jβ).\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are in one direction, and one spin is in the opposite direction.**\n*   Let's consider two spins up and one spin down. There are 3 such states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1).\n    For (+1, +1, -1):\n    X = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1.\n    E = -J(-1) = J.\n    By symmetry, all 3 of these states have the same energy, E = J.\n\n*   Let's consider one spin up and two spins down. There are 3 such states: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    For (+1, -1, -1):\n    X = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1.\n    E = -J(-1) = J.\n    By symmetry, all 3 of these states also have the same energy, E = J.\n\nIn total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 states with energy E = J. The contribution to the partition function from these states is 6 * exp(-βJ) = 6 * exp(-Jβ).\n\n**Calculating the total Partition Function (Z):**\nNow, we sum the contributions from all the states:\nZ = (Contribution from Case 1) + (Contribution from Case 2)\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\n\nOur calculated expression Z = 2exp(3Jβ) + 6exp(-Jβ) matches option B.\n\nThe Python code output also confirms this calculation: `The partition function is Z = 2*exp(3*J*beta) + 6*exp(-1*J*beta)`, which is mathematically identical to Z = 2exp(3Jβ) + 6exp(-Jβ).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe problem is to find the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3, each taking values +1 or -1.

The partition function is Z = Σ e^(-βE), where the sum is over all possible states of the system and β = 1/(kT).\n\nFirst, we need to enumerate all possible states and calculate the energy for each state. There are 2^3 = 8 possible states since each of the three spins can take two values. A state is represented by the triplet (S1, S2, S3).\n\nLet's calculate the term K = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state. The energy will then be E = -J * K.\n\n1.  **State (+1, +1, +1):**\n    K = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3\n    E = -3J\n\n2.  **State (-1, -1, -1):**\n    K = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -3J\n\n    These two states have the same energy, E₁ = -3J. The degeneracy of this energy level is g₁ = 2.\n\n3.  **State (+1, +1, -1):**\n    K = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J(-1) = J\n\n4.  **State (+1, -1, +1):**\n    K = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = J\n\n5.  **State (-1, +1, +1):**\n    K = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = J\n\n6.  **State (+1, -1, -1):**\n    K = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = J\n\n7.  **State (-1, +1, -1):**\n    K = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = J\n\n8.  **State (-1, -1, +1):**\n    K = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = J\n\n    These six states all have the same energy, E₂ = J. The degeneracy of this energy level is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each state.

There are three such states:\n        *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        All three of these states also have the same energy E = J.\n\n    *   **State 4**: All spins down (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n        E4 = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n5.  **Group States by Energy and Degeneracy**:\n    From the calculations above, we have two distinct energy levels:\n    *   Energy level E_1 = -3J. The states corresponding to this energy are (+++) and (---). So, the degeneracy g1 is 2.\n    *   Energy level E_2 = J. All the other 6 states have this energy. So, the degeneracy g2 is 6.\n    The total number of states is g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8, which confirms we have considered all possible states.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Partition Function Z**:\n    Now, we can use the formula Z = g1*e^(-βE1) + g2*e^(-βE2).\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * J)\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options**:\n    The calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\n    Let's compare this with the given choices:\n    A) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\n    B) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n    C) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\n    D) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\n\n    The result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
