Identify the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This is a cascade decay process that proceeds through an intermediate state.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The E1 Selection Rules**\nThe process is governed by the strict E1 selection rules, which dictate which transitions are allowed:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. This is consistent with the intermediate state having $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$).\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints to Find the Intermediate State**\nBy combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value for $n'$ is 2. Therefore, there are exactly three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Probability**\nThe crucial part of the problem is to calculate the probability (or branching ratio) of one specific decay route.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Role of Symmetry**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. Their wavefunctions have no angular dependence, which means the atom in this state has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Isotropic Decay and Equal Probabilities**\nBecause the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available, degenerate final states. The three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and differ only in their spatial orientation. Therefore, the probability is split equally among them.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability of the atom taking any **single specific** path is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P_{total} = P_{step\\;1} \\times P_{step\\;2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We must now select the option from the original prompt that matches this result.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ --- **This option presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.**\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the correct reasoning found across all the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom in the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ decaying to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nEach step must obey the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nBy applying the selection rules to both transitions, we can determine the quantum numbers of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe crucial part of the problem is to find the probability of one specific decay route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step (The Branching Ratio):** The key insight is the **spherical symmetry** of the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$. An s-orbital ($l=0$) has no angular dependence and thus no preferred orientation in space. Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available and degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes for this first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any **single specific path** is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Selection Rules are Strict:** The E1 selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$) are the primary constraints that determine the possible decay paths.\n2.  **Intermediate State is Key:** The problem cannot be solved without first identifying the properties of the intermediate state ($n'=2, l'=1$).\n3.  **Symmetry Dictates Probability:** The spherical symmetry of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the most critical physical principle for calculating the probability. It forces the decay to be isotropic, with the probability split equally among the possible final orientations ($m'$ values).\n4.  **Branching Ratio vs. Total Rate:** The question asks for the probability of a specific route (a branching ratio), not the total decay rate of the state.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe analysis consistently shows that any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We now compare this result with the given options.\n\n*   A) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ --- **This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Physics:** The problem asks for a specific decay path and its probability for a hydrogen atom going from state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade through an intermediate state, |n',l',m'⟩.\n\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules:** I first apply the E1 selection rules (Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1, and Δn < 0 for decay) to determine the properties of the intermediate state.\n    *   **First transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩):** Since the initial state has l=0, the intermediate state must have l'=1. Since m=0, the intermediate state can have m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}. Since n=3, we must have n'<3.\n    *   **Second transition (|n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩):** Since the final state has l_f=0, the intermediate state must have l'=1 for the transition to be allowed (Δl = -1). Since n_f=1, we must have n'>1.\n    *   **Conclusion on Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions, the intermediate state must have n'=2, l'=1, and m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}. This means there are three possible, physically allowed decay paths via the states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability (The Careful Point):** The crucial step is to determine the probability of any single path.\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an s-state, which is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the decay process is **isotropic**. The atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states (m'=-1, 0, 1).\n    *   Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability (branching ratio) for any single path is exactly **1/3**.\n    *   The probability of the second step (e.g., |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) is 1, as it's the only allowed E1 decay channel from the n=2, l=1 level to a lower energy level.\n    *   Therefore, the total probability for any specific cascade route is (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Decide:** All valid candidate answers correctly apply the selection rules and arrive at the same physical conclusion: the probability for any valid route is 1/3.

Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nEach step must obey the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to find the quantum numbers of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Combining the constraints.** The principal quantum number of the intermediate state, $n'$, must satisfy both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that fits is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes shown in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Probability\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the probability of one specific decay route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The role of symmetry.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric; their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. This means the atom has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Isotropic Emission.** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) must be isotropic. This means it is equally likely to proceed into any of the available, degenerate final states.\n*   **Calculation:** Since there are three equally probable intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), and these are the only allowed channels, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them. The probability of transitioning to any *single specific* intermediate state is therefore exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nThe analysis shows that any valid decay route for this process has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We now compare this result with the given options.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ --- **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ --- The route is valid (ignoring the typo), but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches the correct physical reasoning is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning found in the candidate answers and identifying the careful points required to reach the correct solution.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Governing Rules\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Correctly apply the E1 selection rules.**\nThe transitions are governed by the strict E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), energy must be lost, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to find the properties of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combine all constraints to identify the intermediate state.**\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe crucial part of the problem is to calculate the probability of one specific route. The probability of the cascade is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Recognize the symmetry of the initial state.**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric. Their wavefunctions have no angular dependence, meaning the atom has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Apply the principle of isotropic decay.**\nBecause the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available, degenerate final states. The three intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and differ only in their spatial orientation.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Calculate the branching ratio and total probability.**\n*   Since there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, and these are the only allowed channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any **single specific** path is exactly **1/3**.\n*   The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is **1**.

A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric; their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. This means the atom has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, the decay process (spontaneous emission) must be isotropic, meaning it is equally likely to proceed into any of the available, degenerate final states.\n    *   **Calculation:** Since there are three equally probable intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), and these are the only allowed channels, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them. The probability of transitioning to any *single specific* intermediate state is therefore exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4.

Any valid transition path must obey:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (photon emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe must apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to find the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints to Identify All Possible Paths.** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe crucial part of the problem is to calculate the probability of one specific route. The probability of the cascade is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Recognizing the Symmetry of the Initial State.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. Their wavefunctions have no angular dependence, meaning the atom has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Applying the Principle of Isotropic Decay.** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available, degenerate final states.

Identify the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This is a cascade decay process that proceeds through an intermediate state.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The E1 Selection Rules**\nThe process is governed by the strict E1 selection rules, which dictate which transitions are allowed:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. This is consistent with the intermediate state having $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$).\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints to Find the Intermediate State**\nBy combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value for $n'$ is 2. Therefore, there are exactly three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Probability**\nThe crucial part of the problem is to calculate the probability (or branching ratio) of one specific decay route.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Role of Symmetry**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. Their wavefunctions have no angular dependence, which means the atom in this state has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Isotropic Decay and Equal Probabilities**\nBecause the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available, degenerate final states. The three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and differ only in their spatial orientation. Therefore, the probability is split equally among them.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability of the atom taking any **single specific** path is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P_{total} = P_{step\\;1} \\times P_{step\\;2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We must now select the option from the original prompt that matches this result.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ --- **This option presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.**\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the correct reasoning found across all the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom in the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ decaying to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nEach step must obey the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nBy applying the selection rules to both transitions, we can determine the quantum numbers of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe crucial part of the problem is to find the probability of one specific decay route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step (The Branching Ratio):** The key insight is the **spherical symmetry** of the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$. An s-orbital ($l=0$) has no angular dependence and thus no preferred orientation in space. Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available and degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes for this first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any **single specific path** is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Selection Rules are Strict:** The E1 selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$) are the primary constraints that determine the possible decay paths.\n2.  **Intermediate State is Key:** The problem cannot be solved without first identifying the properties of the intermediate state ($n'=2, l'=1$).\n3.  **Symmetry Dictates Probability:** The spherical symmetry of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the most critical physical principle for calculating the probability. It forces the decay to be isotropic, with the probability split equally among the possible final orientations ($m'$ values).\n4.  **Branching Ratio vs. Total Rate:** The question asks for the probability of a specific route (a branching ratio), not the total decay rate of the state.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe analysis consistently shows that any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We now compare this result with the given options.\n\n*   A) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ --- **This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Physics:** The problem asks for a specific decay path and its probability for a hydrogen atom going from state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade through an intermediate state, |n',l',m'⟩.\n\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules:** I first apply the E1 selection rules (Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1, and Δn < 0 for decay) to determine the properties of the intermediate state.\n    *   **First transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩):** Since the initial state has l=0, the intermediate state must have l'=1. Since m=0, the intermediate state can have m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}. Since n=3, we must have n'<3.\n    *   **Second transition (|n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩):** Since the final state has l_f=0, the intermediate state must have l'=1 for the transition to be allowed (Δl = -1). Since n_f=1, we must have n'>1.\n    *   **Conclusion on Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions, the intermediate state must have n'=2, l'=1, and m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}. This means there are three possible, physically allowed decay paths via the states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability (The Careful Point):** The crucial step is to determine the probability of any single path.\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an s-state, which is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the decay process is **isotropic**. The atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states (m'=-1, 0, 1).\n    *   Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability (branching ratio) for any single path is exactly **1/3**.\n    *   The probability of the second step (e.g., |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) is 1, as it's the only allowed E1 decay channel from the n=2, l=1 level to a lower energy level.\n    *   Therefore, the total probability for any specific cascade route is (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Decide:** All valid candidate answers correctly apply the selection rules and arrive at the same physical conclusion: the probability for any valid route is 1/3.

Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nEach step must obey the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to find the quantum numbers of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Combining the constraints.** The principal quantum number of the intermediate state, $n'$, must satisfy both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that fits is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes shown in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Probability\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the probability of one specific decay route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The role of symmetry.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric; their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. This means the atom has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Isotropic Emission.** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) must be isotropic. This means it is equally likely to proceed into any of the available, degenerate final states.\n*   **Calculation:** Since there are three equally probable intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), and these are the only allowed channels, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them. The probability of transitioning to any *single specific* intermediate state is therefore exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nThe analysis shows that any valid decay route for this process has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We now compare this result with the given options.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ --- **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ --- The route is valid (ignoring the typo), but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches the correct physical reasoning is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning found in the candidate answers and identifying the careful points required to reach the correct solution.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Governing Rules\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Correctly apply the E1 selection rules.**\nThe transitions are governed by the strict E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), energy must be lost, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to find the properties of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combine all constraints to identify the intermediate state.**\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 3.

This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nEach step must obey the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to find the quantum numbers of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** The principal quantum number of the intermediate state, $n'$, must satisfy both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that fits is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes shown in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the probability of one specific decay route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n    *   **The role of symmetry:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric; their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. This means the atom has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, the decay process (spontaneous emission) must be isotropic, meaning it is equally likely to proceed into any of the available, degenerate final states.\n    *   **Calculation:** Since there are three equally probable intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), and these are the only allowed channels, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them. The probability of transitioning to any *single specific* intermediate state is therefore exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nThe analysis shows that any valid decay route for this process has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We now compare this result with the given options.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ — Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ — Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ — Incorrect probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ — **Correct route and correct probability.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1.

This decay occurs not in a single step, but via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nEach step in this process must independently obey the E1 selection rules, which dictate which transitions are allowed:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (photon emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to determine the quantum numbers of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$), the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is a valid change.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints to Identify Possible Paths**\nBy combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), we find that the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible, physically allowed intermediate states:\n1.  $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\n2.  $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n\nThis means all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible. The deciding factor must be the probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a single, specific transition route. This is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step (The Branching Ratio):** This is the probability of the atom transitioning from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to one specific intermediate state out of the three possibilities.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Symmetry of the Initial State is Key**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A crucial property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. Their wavefunctions have no angular dependence, which means the atom in this state has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Isotropic Decay and Equal Probabilities**\nBecause the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction or final orientation over another. The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and differ only in their spatial orientation. Therefore, the atom is **equally likely** to transition into any of them. Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any *single specific* path is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nThe analysis shows that any valid decay route for this process has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means it is a cascade decay passing through an intermediate state, $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The E1 Selection Rules**\nThe entire process is governed by the electric dipole (E1) selection rules, which dictate which transitions are allowed:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (photon emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nWe must apply the selection rules to both transitions in the cascade: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. This is consistent with an intermediate state of $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$).\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Uniquely Determining the Intermediate Shell**\nBy combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), we can uniquely determine that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states, corresponding to the three degenerate states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Transition Probability\nThe crucial part of the problem is to find the probability of one specific decay route.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Symmetry of the Initial State**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$). A key physical property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric. This means the atom's electron cloud has no preferred orientation in space.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Isotropic Decay and Equal Probabilities**\nBecause the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available and degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any **single specific path** is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Probability of the Second Step**\nOnce the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state.

The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Correctly Applying the E1 Selection Rules**\nThe first critical step is to apply the strict quantum mechanical selection rules for E1 transitions, which govern which changes in quantum numbers are allowed:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), energy must be lost, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\n\nWe must apply the selection rules to both steps to determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule dictates that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The decay rule requires $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$), which is consistent with the first step.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. The decay rule requires $n'>1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Identifying All Possible Intermediate States**\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$.
