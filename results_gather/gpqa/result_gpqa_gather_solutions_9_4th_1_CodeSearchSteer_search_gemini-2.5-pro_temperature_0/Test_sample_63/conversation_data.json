In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 19\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. We can determine the identity and amount of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, **no acidic gases were formed**. This is a critical piece of information, indicating the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper. This oxygen must have been in a gaseous form (likely O₂).\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts and its inertness, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ends up as the final inert gas, N₂.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Mass Verification:** Let's check if the mass of these elements equals the initial mass.\n    *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n    *   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   The calculated mass matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. Therefore, the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio corresponding to the molar ratio of the elements we found.\n\n*   Molar Ratio: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, divide by the smallest value (0.20):\n    N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n    **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts, likely ammonium salts given the gaseous products, that sum to this formula.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this with the given options:\nA) 13\nB) 17\nC) 15\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities\nThe first step is to determine the identity and amount of each gaseous product based on the experimental data provided.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n    *   **Careful point:** This is a crucial piece of information, as it indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper to form CuO. This mass is solely that of the oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases were removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   **Careful point:** Given its inertness and the likely composition of the salts (nitrogen-based), this gas is correctly identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Careful point (Mass Verification):** It is essential to check that the masses of the calculated elements sum to the initial mass of the mixture.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 4.00 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   The mass matches perfectly, confirming the elemental analysis.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio corresponding to the molar ratio of the elements we found: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that decompose into gases and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\n*   Summing their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### 5. Final Answer Selection\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 13\nB) 15\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to solve this problem involves a systematic, step-by-step chemical analysis based on the provided experimental data. The goal is to identify the original salts and then count their constituent atoms.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products**: I will first determine the identity and quantity (in moles) of each gaseous product formed during the decomposition.\n    *   The mass increase in Tube 1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced. I will calculate the moles of H₂O.\n    *   The lack of mass change in Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution) indicates that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This provides a clue about the elemental composition of the salts (e.g., no carbon).\n    *   The mass increase in Tube 3 (red-hot copper) is due to oxygen atoms reacting to form CuO. I will calculate the moles of these oxygen atoms.\n    *   The remaining gas (Gas C) is inert. I will calculate its moles from the given volume at STP. Based on the context, this gas is almost certainly N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition**: Using the law of conservation of mass, I will calculate the total moles of each element (H, N, O) present in the original 7.20 g mixture. I will then perform a mass balance check by calculating the total mass of these elements to ensure it equals the initial 7.20 g.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts**: The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Therefore, the molar ratio of elements calculated in the previous step corresponds to the combined formula of one unit of Salt A plus one unit of Salt B.\n    *   I will find the simplest whole-number ratio of N:H:O to determine this combined empirical formula.\n    *   Based on the elements (N, H, O) and the fact that they are salts that decompose into gases, I will deduce that they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. I will then find two common salts whose individual formulas sum to the combined formula.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Once the identities of Salt A and Salt B are confirmed, I will count the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt and add them together.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will implement these calculations in a Python script.

The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is a critical point, indicating the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur. The salts are likely composed of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given its inertness and the likely composition of the salts, this gas is correctly identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.

The data from the analysis tubes allow us to determine the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that **no acidic gases were produced**. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given that this gas is inert to the reagents and is a likely decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts, it is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all the atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nTo verify, let's check the total mass:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis is correct.\n\n**3.

The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper to form CuO. Therefore, this mass is the mass of the oxygen that was in a gaseous state.\n    *   Molar mass of O is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases were removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given its inertness and the likely composition of the salts, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2.

Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This means the molar ratio of the elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = N₁ : H₂ : O₁.₂₅\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**\n\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts containing only N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃), which has the formula **N₂H₄O₃**.\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂), which has the formula **N₂H₄O₂**.\n    *   Summing them: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   Total number of atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**5.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases by passing them through a series of tubes. The changes in the tubes allow us to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the final 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nTo verify, let's check the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThis means that the sum of the chemical formulas of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**5.

Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio corresponding to the molar ratio we calculated: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.

Analysis of Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the experimental data from the successive tubes to determine the composition and amount of the gases produced by heating the salt mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which turns cloudy in the presence of acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, we can confidently conclude that **no acidic gases were formed**. This is a crucial point, as it indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas passed over the copper, and the mass increase corresponds to the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

Once identified, we must count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n### **Step 1: Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe gaseous mixture formed upon heating is passed through a series of analytical tubes. The changes in mass and the remaining volume allow us to determine the composition of this mixture.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identify the function of each tube.**\n    *   Tube №1 contains anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a strong drying agent. Its mass increase is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Tube №2 contains Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater), which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   Tube №3 contains red-hot copper, which reacts with oxidizing gases, in this context, oxygen.\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   **Water (H₂O):** The mass increase in Tube №1 is 3.60 g.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Acidic Gases:** The weight of Tube №2 did not change.\n        *   Conclusion: No acidic gases were produced. This strongly suggests the absence of elements like carbon or sulfur in the original salts.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** The mass increase in Tube №3 is 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with copper to form CuO.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas has a volume of 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given its inertness to the previous reagents, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Account for all sources of each element.**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n        *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from Tube №3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Verification:** A mass balance check confirms the analysis.\n    *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n    *   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**. This matches the initial mass.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This is the most critical piece of information for identifying the specific salts. It means the molar ratio of elements we calculated corresponds to the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Molar Ratio:** N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   **Simplest Integer Ratio:** To find this, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear any fractions.\n    *   Dividing by 0.20 gives: 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives: **4 : 8 : 5**\n*   **Combined Formula:** The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   **Deduction:** We need to find two common salts containing only N, H, and O whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Salt A: **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**\n    *   Salt B: **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**\n*   **Check:** (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each of the identified salts.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Total Atoms:** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.

This means the molar ratio of the elements we calculated (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We must find two common salts containing only N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions:\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\n*   Summing their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: what is the total number of all atoms in salts A and B? This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic and identifying all the critical points for reaching the correct solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Decomposition and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the experimental data from the successive tubes to determine the composition and amount of the gases produced by heating the salt mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that no acidic gases were formed.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** This is a crucial negative result. It indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur, which would form acidic oxides upon heating. This strongly suggests the salts are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas passed over the copper, and the mass increase corresponds solely to the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** It is essential to understand that the mass increase is *only* the mass of the oxygen atoms, not the entire mass of the gas or the resulting CuO.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** Given that the salts are nitrogen-based (a common component of salts that decompose to gases) and the final gas is inert, it is correctly identified as nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from CuO formation) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Mass Verification):** A critical check is to ensure the calculated elemental masses sum to the initial mass of the mixture.\n    *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n    *   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5 (The \"Equimolar\" Constraint):** This is the most important clue in the problem. It means the molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) corresponds to the combined formula of *one* unit of salt A and *one* unit of salt B.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio for the combined formula, we divide the molar ratio by the smallest value (0.20):\n    *   N : H : O = (0.20/0.20) : (0.40/0.20) : (0.25/0.20) = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   To clear the fraction, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n    *   **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We must now find two common salts composed of N, H, and O whose formulas sum to this. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) → Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) → Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**\n\n*   Checking the sum: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to answer the specific question: what is the total number of all atoms in salts A and B? This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17.

This mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper. This oxygen must have been in a gaseous form (likely O₂).\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts and its inertness, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2.

The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases.

Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Careful point (Mass Verification):** It is essential to check that the masses of the calculated elements sum to the initial mass of the mixture.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 4.00 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   The mass matches perfectly, confirming the elemental analysis.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio corresponding to the molar ratio of the elements we found: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that decompose into gases and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\n*   Summing their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n### 5.

The goal is to identify the original salts and then count their constituent atoms.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products**: I will first determine the identity and quantity (in moles) of each gaseous product formed during the decomposition.\n    *   The mass increase in Tube 1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂) corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced. I will calculate the moles of H₂O.\n    *   The lack of mass change in Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution) indicates that no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This provides a clue about the elemental composition of the salts (e.g., no carbon).\n    *   The mass increase in Tube 3 (red-hot copper) is due to oxygen atoms reacting to form CuO. I will calculate the moles of these oxygen atoms.\n    *   The remaining gas (Gas C) is inert. I will calculate its moles from the given volume at STP.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition and Their Quantities**\n\nThe first step is to determine the identity and molar amounts of the gaseous products from the experimental data provided.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is a critical point, indicating the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur. The salts are likely composed of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases are removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given its inertness and the likely composition of the salts, this gas is correctly identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Mass Verification (Careful Point):** We must check if the mass of these elements equals the initial mass.\n    *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n    *   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   The calculated mass matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio corresponding to the molar ratio we calculated:\n*   N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that decompose into gases and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 19\nB) 15\nC) 13\nD) 17\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases. The data from the analysis tubes allow us to determine the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that **no acidic gases were produced**. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase is solely from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other components were removed, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given that this gas is inert to the reagents and is a likely decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts, it is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all the atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nTo verify, let's check the total mass:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio corresponding to the molar ratio we calculated:\n*   N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two common salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n**5.

Analysis of Gaseous Products and Molar Quantities**\n\nThe first step is to use the experimental data to identify the products of the decomposition and their respective amounts in moles.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper to form CuO. Therefore, this mass is the mass of the oxygen that was in a gaseous state.\n    *   Molar mass of O is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases were removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given its inertness and the likely composition of the salts, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from reaction with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Mass Verification.** It is crucial to check if the masses of the calculated elements sum up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   The mass matches perfectly, confirming the elemental analysis is correct.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This means the molar ratio of the elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = N₁ : H₂ : O₁.₂₅\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**\n\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.

The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This strongly suggests the original salts do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g. This is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper to form CuO. Therefore, the mass increase is the mass of the oxygen that was present as a gas.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.

Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles from H₂O) + (moles from CuO formation) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Mass Verification (Careful Point):** We can check our work by calculating the total mass of these elements.\n    *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n    *   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This is the key to solving the puzzle. It means the molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) corresponds to the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we divide by the smallest value (0.20):\n    *   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   To clear the fraction, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\n    *   **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We must now find two common salts (composed of N, H, and O) that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) → Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) → Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: what is the total number of all atoms in salts A and B? This means summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided answers and identifying key points for a careful solution.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of the task is to identify two unknown salts, A and B, by analyzing the products of their thermal decomposition. Once identified, we must count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n### **Step 1: Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe gaseous mixture formed upon heating is passed through a series of analytical tubes. The changes in mass and the remaining volume allow us to determine the composition of this mixture.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identify the function of each tube.**\n    *   Tube №1 contains anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a strong drying agent. Its mass increase is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Tube №2 contains Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater), which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   Tube №3 contains red-hot copper, which reacts with oxidizing gases, in this context, oxygen.\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   **Water (H₂O):** The mass increase in Tube №1 is 3.60 g.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Acidic Gases:** The weight of Tube №2 did not change.\n        *   Conclusion: No acidic gases were produced. This strongly suggests the absence of elements like carbon or sulfur in the original salts.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** The mass increase in Tube №3 is 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with copper to form CuO.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas has a volume of 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given its inertness to the previous reagents, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Account for all sources of each element.**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is present in both the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n        *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from Tube №3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Verification:** A mass balance check confirms the analysis.\n    *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n    *   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**. This matches the initial mass.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This is the most critical piece of information for identifying the specific salts. It means the molar ratio of elements we calculated corresponds to the combined formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Molar Ratio:** N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   **Simplest Integer Ratio:** To find this, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear any fractions.\n    *   Dividing by 0.20 gives: 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives: **4 : 8 : 5**\n*   **Combined Formula:** The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   **Deduction:** We need to find two common salts containing only N, H, and O whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Salt A: **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**\n    *   Salt B: **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**\n*   **Check:** (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each of the identified salts.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Total Atoms:** (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of the experimental data to determine the composition of the original salt mixture. The consensus among the provided answers is strong, with the primary discrepancies arising from clerical errors in matching the final calculated number to the correct multiple-choice letter.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe first step is to use the data from the three tubes and the final remaining gas to determine the moles of each product formed when the salt mixture was heated.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a drying agent, so the mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This is a crucial point, indicating the original salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper to form CuO. This mass is purely the mass of the oxygen.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the other gases were removed, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given its inertness and the likely composition of the salts, this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can calculate the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water produced and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is found in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Mass Verification:** A quick check confirms our analysis:\n    *   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n    *   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**. This matches the initial mass.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture was **equimolar**. This means the molar ratio of the elements we calculated (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B.\n\n*   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n    *   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We must find two common salts containing only N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions:\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\n*   Summing their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: what is the total number of all atoms in salts A and B? This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
