In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate\n\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 2 and 3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nTo determine the final answer, a systematic analysis of each compound for chirality is required. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the chemical principles for each compound, leading to a definitive conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe core task is to identify which of the four compounds are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it lacks key symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Careful Point**: The key feature to check in substituted biphenyls is **atropisomerism**. This phenomenon occurs when bulky groups at the *ortho* positions (the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings: 2, 2', 6, and 6') restrict free rotation.\n*   **Analysis**: In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are substituted with bulky groups (two nitro groups, -NO₂, and two methoxycarbonyl groups, -COOCH₃). This significant steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation. This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral due to this axial chirality. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Careful Point**: The most common source of chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Careful Point**: For molecules without an obvious chiral center, it is crucial to check for overall molecular **symmetry**.\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule does not have a chiral center. More importantly, it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Careful Point**: It is important to recognize the geometry of this molecule. It is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, which has a rigid, planar structure that often leads to high symmetry.\n*   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar. This molecular plane is itself a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, there is a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that only compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. We now match this conclusion with the given options:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 3 and 4\nD) 1 and 2\n\nThe correct option is the one that lists only compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of chirality is the requirement for a compound to be optically active. The analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the chemical properties of each molecule.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound, incorporating the key points of consideration:\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n*   A molecule shows optical isomerism only if it is chiral.\n*   Chirality means the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   The absence of symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, is a key indicator of chirality.\n*   Common sources of chirality include a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and a chiral axis (as seen in atropisomerism).\n\n---\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The critical feature to check is the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. The positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n*   **Careful Point**: The large size of these *ortho* substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

The presence of this center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. This molecule does not have a chiral center. We must check for overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Careful Point**: The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral (superimposable on its mirror image). Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Careful Point**: The molecule possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.

This restriction creates stable, chiral conformers (atropisomers).\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: The presence of a plane of symmetry (a plane that divides the molecule into two identical halves) or a center of inversion (a point through which all atoms can be reflected to an identical atom on the opposite side) makes a molecule achiral.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Compound\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The key feature to check is the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. The positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n*   **Conclusion**: The significant steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the rings from rotating freely to become coplanar. This phenomenon, known as atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We must check for a chiral center. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion**: Since all four attached groups are different, the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. This molecule does not have a chiral center. We must check for overall molecular symmetry. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. It possesses two key symmetry elements: a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe analysis confirms that only compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it lacks key symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Careful Point**: The key feature to check in substituted biphenyls is **atropisomerism**. This phenomenon occurs when bulky groups at the *ortho* positions (the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings: 2, 2', 6, and 6') restrict free rotation.\n*   **Analysis**: In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are substituted with bulky groups (two nitro groups, -NO₂, and two methoxycarbonyl groups, -COOCH₃). This significant steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation. This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral due to this axial chirality.

Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Careful Point**: For molecules without an obvious chiral center, it is crucial to check for overall molecular **symmetry**.\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule does not have a chiral center. More importantly, it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.

It is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, which has a rigid, planar structure that often leads to high symmetry.\n*   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar. This molecular plane is itself a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, there is a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.

The analysis involves identifying sources of chirality and checking for the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n### Careful Points for Analysis\n*   **Chirality**: The primary condition for optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Chiral Center**: The most common source of chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Atropisomerism**: A special type of chirality found in molecules like substituted biphenyls. It arises from restricted rotation around a single bond, which locks the molecule into stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (atropisomers).\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: The presence of a plane of symmetry (a plane that divides the molecule into two identical halves) or a center of inversion (a point in the center of the molecule through which all atoms can be reflected to an identical atom on the opposite side) makes a molecule achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Compound\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The key feature is the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. The positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n*   **Conclusion**: The large size of these groups creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We must check for a chiral center. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion**: Since all four attached groups are different, the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center. The presence of this center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule does not have a chiral center. We must check for overall molecular symmetry. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It possesses two key symmetry elements: a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.

This occurs when bulky substituents restrict free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings.\n*   **Analysis**: The positions adjacent to the bond connecting the two phenyl rings (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and methoxycarbonyl -COOCH₃). This steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely to become coplanar. The molecule is locked into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Careful Point**: The most common source of chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.\n*   **Analysis**: The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Careful Point**: For molecules without an obvious chiral center, it is crucial to check for overall molecular **symmetry**.\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Careful Point**: It is important to recognize that this is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, which has specific geometric and symmetry properties.\n*   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It possesses two key symmetry elements: a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.
