Deconstruct the Question and Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Structural Analysis:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director. Its large size creates significant steric hindrance.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Primary Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. Introducing a group *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group is difficult. A standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors the *para* position, which directly conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement for this specific product.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nThe most reliable method to solve this problem is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in the proposed sequences. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    *   This option is written in a confusing and illogical order.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (vi) attempts to nitrate this highly unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; the salt would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Remaining Viable Option**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each option, we find that Options B, C, and D contain fatal chemical flaws—reactions that are impossible or nonsensical as written. Option A is the only sequence where every transformation is a valid, known chemical reaction that leads to the correctly named product.\n\nAlthough the \"high-yield\" claim in the prompt is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option A is unequivocally the best and only possible answer among the choices. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically plausible (even if inefficient) pathway must be chosen over pathways that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis of each option is required. The analysis must consider reaction feasibility, regioselectivity, steric effects, and the directing effects of substituents.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure**: The product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring. The substituents are a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO₂). The adjacent placement of these groups, especially the bulky -tBu group, presents a significant synthetic challenge.\n\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint**: The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but its large size sterically hinders substitution at the adjacent *ortho* positions. Therefore, any standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor the *para* product. A pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho* isomer cannot be considered high-yield. This creates a potential conflict between achieving the correct structure and achieving a high yield.\n\n3.  **Identification of Fatal Flaws**: The most effective method to solve this problem is to identify chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in the proposed sequences. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option. Common flaws to look for include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation on a Deactivated Ring**: Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on rings that are strongly deactivated, such as those bearing a nitro group or an anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). They also fail on aniline itself because the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amino group.\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates**: Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order**: Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization before the corresponding amine has been formed).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    **Conclusion: Option D is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    This sequence is written in a confusing order, but a clear flaw exists. Step (iv) calls for diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine. However, the amine-forming step (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until much later at step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    **Conclusion: Option C is chemically impossible due to an illogical reaction order.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate. Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration.\n    **Conclusion: Option B is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its pathway:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **ii) Nitration**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction**: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **iv) Nitration**: In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization**: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis**: The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. (Valid)\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis**: The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether product. (Valid)\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy elimination, Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step (ii), Option A is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice format, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be selected over impossible ones.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Goal\nThe objective is to identify the correct sequence of reactions that leads to the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, starting from benzene.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at its adjacent *ortho* positions, making *para* substitution heavily favored.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Synthetic Challenges:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. The \"high-yield\" requirement is a critical constraint, as any step that produces a minor isomer as the desired product would violate this condition.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option\nWe will analyze each option as written in the prompt for chemical feasibility. A single impossible or nonsensical step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written nonsensically with duplicate step numbers. More importantly, step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The product after step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, not an amine. This step is impossible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts, formed in step (v), are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis). They are not suitable substrates for nitration and would decompose under the harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n### 4. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option\n*   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the final product, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nBy the process of elimination, Options A, C, and D are fundamentally flawed because they contain chemically impossible reaction steps. Option B is the only sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correctly named target molecule. Although the synthesis described in Option B is not truly \"high-yield\" because it relies on the separation of a minor isomer in an early step, it is the only viable pathway among the choices. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient route is the correct answer over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Goal**\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Target Molecule's Structure**\nThe target molecule is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents. This 1,2,3-substitution pattern presents specific challenges.\n*   **Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt):** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is typically added late in a synthesis, often by converting a phenol group via Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Its most important feature is its large size (steric bulk), which severely hinders reactions at the adjacent *ortho* positions.\n*   **Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### **3. Careful Points and Synthetic Strategy**\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The primary challenge is placing substituents at positions 1 and 3, which are both *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. A direct electrophilic attack on tert-butylbenzene (e.g., nitration) will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the *para* position (position 4), not the *ortho* position (position 2). Any pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho* product from the major *para* product will not be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Directing Effects:** The order of reactions is critical to ensure the substituents are placed in the correct relative positions. A common strategy for complex substitution patterns is to introduce a group, modify it to change its directing effect, and then add the next group.\n*   **Elimination of Impossible Reactions:** The most efficient way to solve this problem is to identify sequences that contain chemically impossible steps. Common errors in proposed syntheses include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts reactions on deactivated rings or anilines:** The Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation/acylation.\n    *   **Reactions on unstable intermediates:** Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly reactive diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical sequence:** Attempting a reaction (e.g., diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl) before the necessary functional group (a primary amine) has been formed.\n\n### **4. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on the principles above.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence is poorly formatted but appears to form a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions. They cannot be used as substrates for a subsequent nitration reaction and would decompose under the harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is also poorly formatted. It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv, `NaNO2/HCl`).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine as the starting material. At this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) Nitration:** tert-butylbenzene is nitrated. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To get the target product, the minor *ortho* isomer must be used. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) Nitration:** The amine is protonated in strong acid to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **vii) Etherification:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether via Williamson synthesis. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy elimination, Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the low yield of the required isomer in step (ii), it is the only viable choice. In multiple-choice questions of this type, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route is the correct answer over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Question\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Constraint:** The synthesis should be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Task:** Evaluate the four provided reaction sequences (A, B, C, D) and select the only chemically viable one.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded.\n    *   Introducing a substituent *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution is difficult and typically low-yield, as the *para* position is heavily favored.\n    *   The final steps likely involve converting an amine to the ethoxy group via a phenol intermediate. The core challenge is correctly assembling the three groups on the ring.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nThe most effective method is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in each sequence. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option. Let's analyze the options as written in the prompt.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis to phenols). They are not suitable substrates for nitration and would decompose under the harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in an illogical order.

A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only remaining option. Let's trace the pathway to confirm its validity.\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. While this step is not high-yield, it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene yields **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n    5.  **Step v:** Diazotization of the amino group forms a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **Step vi:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps and are therefore incorrect. Option C is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is questionable due to the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option C is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices and must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Goal\nThe primary objective is to identify the single correct reaction sequence out of four options (A, B, C, D) that leads to the synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** starting from benzene. A key, but potentially misleading, constraint is that the synthesis should be \"high-yield\".\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges\n*   **Structure:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. This makes any reaction at the adjacent (ortho) positions sterically hindered and therefore difficult. A standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene, such as nitration, will heavily favor substitution at the distant *para* position.\n*   **The \"High-Yield\" Problem:** The requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis directly conflicts with the need to create a product with a substituent *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. Any pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho*-substituted isomer from the major *para*-substituted isomer cannot be considered high-yield.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\nThe most effective method is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction is impossible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction, hydrolysis to phenols). They are not suitable substrates for nitration and would decompose under the harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n### 4. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Viable Option\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    *   By elimination, this is the only potentially correct answer. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, one must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group yields **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** Diazotization of the amino group forms a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous, but the core synthesis (i-vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n### Final Decision\nOptions B, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option A is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be chosen over impossible ones.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions, a rigorous, step-by-step analysis of each option is required, focusing on chemical feasibility, regioselectivity, and steric effects.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Product Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weakly activating *ortho, para*-director. Its significant bulk creates steric hindrance, making substitution at adjacent positions difficult.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Synthetic Challenge:** The primary difficulty is achieving the 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially placing a substituent at position 3, which is *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. The \"high-yield\" constraint is critical, as any step that produces the desired product as a minor isomer would violate this condition.\n\n### **2. Systematic Elimination of Chemically Impossible Options**\n\nThe most efficient approach is to first identify and eliminate any sequences that contain fundamentally flawed or impossible chemical steps.\n\n*   **Option A:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence attempts to perform a nitration (step vi) on a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis). They are not suitable substrates for further electrophilic aromatic substitution and would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `... iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is in an illogical order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n### **3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Viable Option**\n\nBy elimination, Option D is the only potentially correct answer. We must analyze its pathway in detail.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    1.  **Step i:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid reaction.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product. To reach the final target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but directly contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition of the question.\n    3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the *ortho* isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n    5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. This is a standard diazotization.\n    6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is a standard reaction.\n    7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a valid and typically high-yield step.\n    8.  The final steps (viii and ix) are superfluous as the target molecule has already been synthesized.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and C are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible reaction steps. Option D is the only sequence that is chemically plausible and leads to the correctly named target molecule. The conflict arises from the \"high-yield\" constraint in the question, which is violated by the low yield of the required *ortho* isomer in step (ii). However, in a multiple-choice format, a chemically possible but inefficient pathway must be chosen over pathways that are chemically impossible. Therefore, Option D is the only correct answer by elimination.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis of each proposed option is required. The key is to identify the single pathway that is chemically feasible, even if it has practical limitations.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Key Challenges:**\n    1.  **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky, which sterically hinders any reaction at the adjacent *ortho* positions. A simple electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will heavily favor the *para* product.\n    2.  **Directing Effects:** The synthesis must correctly manage the directing effects of multiple substituents, which change as functional groups are added or modified.\n    3.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This is a critical piece of information that conflicts with the steric reality of forming the target molecule. Any pathway that requires separating a minor *ortho* isomer from a major *para* isomer cannot be considered high-yield.\n\n### **Step 2: Systematically Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nThe most effective method is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi).

It attempts to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Remaining Plausible Option**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer**.

(Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is a key, regioselective step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director.

Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine.

By elimination, it should be correct. Let's verify the pathway. The core synthesis is contained in steps i-vii.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-isomers. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the minor **ortho-isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)**. This step is chemically possible but is not high-yield.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), a meta-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (This is a known, albeit not perfectly selective, reaction).\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps and are therefore definitively incorrect. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of at least one step, Option A is the only viable choice among the given options. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be chosen over impossible ones.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Goal\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which is a key, albeit potentially misleading, piece of information.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure\nThe target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   **Position 1:** Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **Position 2:** tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weakly activating, ortho/para-director. Its large size creates significant steric hindrance for substitution at the adjacent positions.\n*   **Position 3:** Nitro group (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe primary synthetic challenge is installing three groups next to each other, especially when one is the bulky tert-butyl group. A simple electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene would heavily favor the para-product, not the ortho-product needed for this synthesis.\n\n### 3. Systematically Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\nThe most effective method is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in each sequence. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is illogical. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from the preceding step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. Therefore, this reaction is impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis to phenols), not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step is chemically possible but contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nOptions A, B, and C are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical reaction steps. By elimination, Option D is the only plausible choice. Although its second step would give a low yield of the required isomer (conflicting with the \"high-yield\" claim in the prompt), the sequence of reactions itself is chemically sound and is the only one that can lead to the named target molecule. In the context of a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient route is the correct answer over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goals\nThe objective is to find a high-yield synthesis for **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** starting from benzene.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded.\n    *   Introducing a substituent *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution is difficult and typically results in low yields, as the *para* position is heavily favored.\n    *   The \"high-yield\" constraint is critical and must be considered when evaluating pathways.\n\n### 2. Systematic Elimination of Chemically Impossible Options\nThe most effective strategy is to first identify and eliminate any proposed sequences that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. This option is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv), a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), requires a primary aromatic amine as a starting material. However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present. This option is chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which was formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction, hydrolysis to phenols). They are not suitable substrates for nitration and would decompose under the harsh reaction conditions. This option is chemically impossible.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Viable Option\nBy elimination, only one option remains. We must analyze it to confirm it leads to the correct product.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    This sequence is the only one without a fatal chemical flaw. Let's trace the pathway:\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**.\n    3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n    5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO₂/HCl`. (Valid)\n    6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion and Resolution of the \"High-Yield\" Conflict\nOptions A, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible series of transformations that leads to the correctly named target molecule.\n\nThe conflict arises from the \"high-yield\" constraint in the question. Step (ii) of Option B is not high-yield for the required ortho isomer. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient pathway is the only correct choice when all other options are chemically impossible. The flaw lies in the question's premise, not in the chemical logic of sequence B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct answer, a systematic analysis of each proposed reaction sequence is required. The goal is to find the single most plausible pathway for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene, while considering the \"high-yield\" constraint.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), and -NO₂ (nitro).\n*   **Key Challenges:**\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is very bulky, which makes substitution at the adjacent *ortho* positions (like position 3 relative to position 2) difficult. Standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors the *para* position.\n    *   **Regiochemistry:** The synthesis must correctly install three different groups in a specific 1,2,3-pattern, managing the directing effects of each substituent at every stage.\n    *   **\"High-Yield\" Constraint:** This implies that steps producing significant amounts of unwanted isomers, requiring separation of a minor product, should be avoided.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nThe most effective method is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence proceeds to form a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and are not stable enough to serve as substrates for nitration. They would decompose under the harsh acidic conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`) in step (iv).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The substrate produced after step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which is not an amine. The reaction is attempted on the wrong functional group in an illogical order.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n**3. Validate the Remaining Plausible Option**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) Nitration:** This is the key regiochemical step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n        5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to form a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted with base and ethyl bromide to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they each contain at least one chemically impossible reaction. Option B is the only sequence where every step is a valid chemical transformation that leads to the named target molecule.\n\nThe conflict arises with the \"high-yield\" condition. Step (ii) of Option B is not high-yield for the required *ortho* isomer. However, in a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient pathway must be chosen over pathways that are chemically impossible. The flaw lies in the question's premise, not in the chemical logic of sequence B. By elimination, it is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to identify the correct reaction sequence, from the given options, that leads to the synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** starting from benzene. A key, but potentially conflicting, constraint is that the synthesis should be \"high-yield\".\n\n### **2. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Structure:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Careful Point 1: Steric Hindrance.** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. This creates significant steric hindrance, making it very difficult to introduce new substituents at the adjacent *ortho* positions (in this case, positions 1 and 3 relative to the tert-butyl group).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"High-Yield\" Constraint.** Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors substitution at the distant *para* position to avoid steric clash. Any pathway that requires substitution *ortho* to the tert-butyl group will likely be a low-yield process. This creates a potential conflict with the \"high-yield\" requirement in the question. The correct answer must be chemically possible above all else.\n\n### **3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will analyze each option for chemical feasibility. A single impossible or nonsensical step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in a nonsensical order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary amine, but the reduction to an amine (`viii) Fe/HCl`) occurs much later. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (`vi) HNO3/H2SO4` immediately after forming one in step `v`). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under these conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii).

(Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv (Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity):** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol.

Option D is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible series of transformations that successfully produces the target molecule. Although the synthesis is not truly \"high-yield\" due to the poor regioselectivity in step (ii), it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices.

    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a rigorous, step-by-step analysis of each option is required. The most effective method is to identify chemically impossible steps to eliminate incorrect options.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure:** The product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring. The substituents are a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO₂). The adjacent placement of these groups, especially the bulky -tBu group, presents a significant synthetic challenge.\n\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but its large size sterically hinders substitution at the adjacent *ortho* positions. Therefore, any standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor the *para* product. A pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho* isomer cannot be considered high-yield. However, in a multiple-choice question, a chemically *possible* route must be chosen over chemically *impossible* routes, even if it has low-yield steps.\n\n3.  **Identification of Fatal Flaws:** The most effective way to solve this problem is to identify sequences that contain chemically impossible steps. Common flaws to look for include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts reactions on anilines:** The Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation or acylation.\n    *   **Reactions on unstable intermediates:** Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical reaction order:** Attempting a reaction (e.g., diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl) before the necessary functional group (a primary amine) has been formed.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This reaction is not feasible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in a confusing and illogical order. Step (iv) calls for diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine. However, at this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate in step (vi). Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   This is the only remaining option. By elimination, it must be the correct choice. Let's verify its chemical plausibility:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.

Deconstruct the Question and Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Structural Analysis:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director. Its large size creates significant steric hindrance.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Primary Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. Introducing a group *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group is difficult. A standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors the *para* position, which directly conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement for this specific product.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nThe most reliable method to solve this problem is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in the proposed sequences. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    *   This option is written in a confusing and illogical order.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (vi) attempts to nitrate this highly unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; the salt would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Remaining Viable Option**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each option, we find that Options B, C, and D contain fatal chemical flaws—reactions that are impossible or nonsensical as written. Option A is the only sequence where every transformation is a valid, known chemical reaction that leads to the correctly named product.\n\nAlthough the \"high-yield\" claim in the prompt is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option A is unequivocally the best and only possible answer among the choices. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically plausible (even if inefficient) pathway must be chosen over pathways that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis of each option is required. The analysis must consider reaction feasibility, regioselectivity, steric effects, and the directing effects of substituents.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Structure**: The product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring. The substituents are a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO₂). The adjacent placement of these groups, especially the bulky -tBu group, presents a significant synthetic challenge.\n\n2.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint**: The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but its large size sterically hinders substitution at the adjacent *ortho* positions. Therefore, any standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will overwhelmingly favor the *para* product. A pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho* isomer cannot be considered high-yield. This creates a potential conflict between achieving the correct structure and achieving a high yield.\n\n3.  **Identification of Fatal Flaws**: The most effective method to solve this problem is to identify chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in the proposed sequences. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option. Common flaws to look for include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation on a Deactivated Ring**: Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on rings that are strongly deactivated, such as those bearing a nitro group or an anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). They also fail on aniline itself because the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amino group.\n    *   **Reactions on Unstable Intermediates**: Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly unstable diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical Reaction Order**: Attempting a reaction on a functional group before it has been created (e.g., performing a diazotization before the corresponding amine has been formed).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    **Conclusion: Option D is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    This sequence is written in a confusing order, but a clear flaw exists. Step (iv) calls for diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine. However, the amine-forming step (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until much later at step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    **Conclusion: Option C is chemically impossible due to an illogical reaction order.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate. Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and would decompose under the harsh conditions of nitration.\n    **Conclusion: Option B is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its pathway:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **ii) Nitration**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction**: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **iv) Nitration**: In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization**: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis**: The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. (Valid)\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis**: The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether product. (Valid)\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy elimination, Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step (ii), Option A is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice format, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be selected over impossible ones.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Goal\nThe objective is to identify the correct sequence of reactions that leads to the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, starting from benzene.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at its adjacent *ortho* positions, making *para* substitution heavily favored.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Synthetic Challenges:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. The \"high-yield\" requirement is a critical constraint, as any step that produces a minor isomer as the desired product would violate this condition.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option\nWe will analyze each option as written in the prompt for chemical feasibility. A single impossible or nonsensical step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written nonsensically with duplicate step numbers. More importantly, step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The product after step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, not an amine. This step is impossible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts, formed in step (v), are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis). They are not suitable substrates for nitration and would decompose under the harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n### 4. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option\n*   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the final product, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nBy the process of elimination, Options A, C, and D are fundamentally flawed because they contain chemically impossible reaction steps. Option B is the only sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correctly named target molecule. Although the synthesis described in Option B is not truly \"high-yield\" because it relies on the separation of a minor isomer in an early step, it is the only viable pathway among the choices. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient route is the correct answer over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Goal**\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Target Molecule's Structure**\nThe target molecule is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents. This 1,2,3-substitution pattern presents specific challenges.\n*   **Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt):** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is typically added late in a synthesis, often by converting a phenol group via Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Its most important feature is its large size (steric bulk), which severely hinders reactions at the adjacent *ortho* positions.\n*   **Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### **3. Careful Points and Synthetic Strategy**\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The primary challenge is placing substituents at positions 1 and 3, which are both *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. A direct electrophilic attack on tert-butylbenzene (e.g., nitration) will overwhelmingly favor substitution at the *para* position (position 4), not the *ortho* position (position 2). Any pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho* product from the major *para* product will not be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Directing Effects:** The order of reactions is critical to ensure the substituents are placed in the correct relative positions. A common strategy for complex substitution patterns is to introduce a group, modify it to change its directing effect, and then add the next group.\n*   **Elimination of Impossible Reactions:** The most efficient way to solve this problem is to identify sequences that contain chemically impossible steps. Common errors in proposed syntheses include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts reactions on deactivated rings or anilines:** The Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation/acylation.\n    *   **Reactions on unstable intermediates:** Attempting further electrophilic substitution (like nitration) on a highly reactive diazonium salt is not a viable reaction.\n    *   **Illogical sequence:** Attempting a reaction (e.g., diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl) before the necessary functional group (a primary amine) has been formed.\n\n### **4. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on the principles above.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence is poorly formatted but appears to form a diazonium salt in step (v) and then attempts to nitrate it in step (vi).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions. They cannot be used as substrates for a subsequent nitration reaction and would decompose under the harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is also poorly formatted. It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv, `NaNO2/HCl`).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine as the starting material. At this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) Nitration:** tert-butylbenzene is nitrated. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To get the target product, the minor *ortho* isomer must be used. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) Nitration:** The amine is protonated in strong acid to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **vii) Etherification:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether via Williamson synthesis. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy elimination, Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically impossible steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the low yield of the required isomer in step (ii), it is the only viable choice. In multiple-choice questions of this type, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route is the correct answer over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Question\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Constraint:** The synthesis should be \"high-yield\".\n*   **Task:** Evaluate the four provided reaction sequences (A, B, C, D) and select the only chemically viable one.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded.\n    *   Introducing a substituent *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution is difficult and typically low-yield, as the *para* position is heavily favored.\n    *   The final steps likely involve converting an amine to the ethoxy group via a phenol intermediate. The core challenge is correctly assembling the three groups on the ring.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nThe most effective method is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in each sequence. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option. Let's analyze the options as written in the prompt.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis to phenols).

It attempts to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in an illogical order.

This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. While this step is not high-yield, it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene yields **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director.

Option C is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is questionable due to the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option C is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices and must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Goal\nThe primary objective is to identify the single correct reaction sequence out of four options (A, B, C, D) that leads to the synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** starting from benzene. A key, but potentially misleading, constraint is that the synthesis should be \"high-yield\".\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges\n*   **Structure:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. This makes any reaction at the adjacent (ortho) positions sterically hindered and therefore difficult. A standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene, such as nitration, will heavily favor substitution at the distant *para* position.\n*   **The \"High-Yield\" Problem:** The requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis directly conflicts with the need to create a product with a substituent *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. Any pathway that relies on separating the minor *ortho*-substituted isomer from the major *para*-substituted isomer cannot be considered high-yield.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\nThe most effective method is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction is impossible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction, hydrolysis to phenols). They are not suitable substrates for nitration and would decompose under the harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n### 4. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Viable Option\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    *   By elimination, this is the only potentially correct answer. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, one must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group yields **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **Step v:** Diazotization of the amino group forms a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous, but the core synthesis (i-vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n### Final Decision\nOptions B, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option A is the only viable choice. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be chosen over impossible ones.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions, a rigorous, step-by-step analysis of each option is required, focusing on chemical feasibility, regioselectivity, and steric effects.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Product Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weakly activating *ortho, para*-director. Its significant bulk creates steric hindrance, making substitution at adjacent positions difficult.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Synthetic Challenge:** The primary difficulty is achieving the 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially placing a substituent at position 3, which is *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. The \"high-yield\" constraint is critical, as any step that produces the desired product as a minor isomer would violate this condition.\n\n### **2. Systematic Elimination of Chemically Impossible Options**\n\nThe most efficient approach is to first identify and eliminate any sequences that contain fundamentally flawed or impossible chemical steps.\n\n*   **Option A:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence attempts to perform a nitration (step vi) on a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis). They are not suitable substrates for further electrophilic aromatic substitution and would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `... iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is in an illogical order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n### **3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Viable Option**\n\nBy elimination, Option D is the only potentially correct answer. We must analyze its pathway in detail.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    1.  **Step i:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid reaction.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product. To reach the final target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**. This step is chemically possible but directly contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition of the question.\n    3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the *ortho* isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n    5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. This is a standard diazotization.\n    6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is a standard reaction.\n    7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a valid and typically high-yield step.\n    8.  The final steps (viii and ix) are superfluous as the target molecule has already been synthesized.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and C are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible reaction steps. Option D is the only sequence that is chemically plausible and leads to the correctly named target molecule. The conflict arises from the \"high-yield\" constraint in the question, which is violated by the low yield of the required *ortho* isomer in step (ii). However, in a multiple-choice format, a chemically possible but inefficient pathway must be chosen over pathways that are chemically impossible. Therefore, Option D is the only correct answer by elimination.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis of each proposed option is required. The key is to identify the single pathway that is chemically feasible, even if it has practical limitations.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Key Challenges:**\n    1.  **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky, which sterically hinders any reaction at the adjacent *ortho* positions. A simple electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will heavily favor the *para* product.\n    2.  **Directing Effects:** The synthesis must correctly manage the directing effects of multiple substituents, which change as functional groups are added or modified.\n    3.  **The \"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This is a critical piece of information that conflicts with the steric reality of forming the target molecule. Any pathway that requires separating a minor *ortho* isomer from a major *para* isomer cannot be considered high-yield.\n\n### **Step 2: Systematically Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nThe most effective method is to eliminate any sequence that contains a chemically impossible or nonsensical step.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi).

This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Remaining Plausible Option**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step.

The options provided in the prompt are:\n\n*   **A)** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4\n*   **B)** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...\n*   **C)** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n*   **D)** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...\n\nLet's analyze them:\n\n*   **Analysis of Option B:**\n    *   This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This reaction is impossible. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option C:**\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis), not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option D:**\n    *   This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, the amine-forming step (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until much later at step (viii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option A:**\n    *   This is the only remaining option. By elimination, it should be correct. Let's verify the pathway. The core synthesis is contained in steps i-vii.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-isomers. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the minor **ortho-isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)**. This step is chemically possible but is not high-yield.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), a meta-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (This is a known, albeit not perfectly selective, reaction).\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps and are therefore definitively incorrect. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of at least one step, Option A is the only viable choice among the given options. In a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (even if inefficient) route must be chosen over impossible ones.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Goal\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which is a key, albeit potentially misleading, piece of information.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure\nThe target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   **Position 1:** Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **Position 2:** tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weakly activating, ortho/para-director. Its large size creates significant steric hindrance for substitution at the adjacent positions.\n*   **Position 3:** Nitro group (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe primary synthetic challenge is installing three groups next to each other, especially when one is the bulky tert-butyl group. A simple electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene would heavily favor the para-product, not the ortho-product needed for this synthesis.\n\n### 3. Systematically Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\nThe most effective method is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in each sequence. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is illogical. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from the preceding step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. Therefore, this reaction is impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis to phenols), not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step is chemically possible but contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nOptions A, B, and C are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical reaction steps. By elimination, Option D is the only plausible choice. Although its second step would give a low yield of the required isomer (conflicting with the \"high-yield\" claim in the prompt), the sequence of reactions itself is chemically sound and is the only one that can lead to the named target molecule. In the context of a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient route is the correct answer over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goals\nThe objective is to find a high-yield synthesis for **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** starting from benzene.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded.\n    *   Introducing a substituent *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution is difficult and typically results in low yields, as the *para* position is heavily favored.\n    *   The \"high-yield\" constraint is critical and must be considered when evaluating pathways.\n\n### 2. Systematic Elimination of Chemically Impossible Options\nThe most effective strategy is to first identify and eliminate any proposed sequences that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. This option is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv), a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), requires a primary aromatic amine as a starting material. However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present. This option is chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which was formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction, hydrolysis to phenols). They are not suitable substrates for nitration and would decompose under the harsh reaction conditions. This option is chemically impossible.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Viable Option\nBy elimination, only one option remains. We must analyze it to confirm it leads to the correct product.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    This sequence is the only one without a fatal chemical flaw. Let's trace the pathway:\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor *ortho* isomer**.\n    3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n    5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO₂/HCl`. (Valid)\n    6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion and Resolution of the \"High-Yield\" Conflict\nOptions A, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible series of transformations that leads to the correctly named target molecule.\n\nThe conflict arises from the \"high-yield\" constraint in the question. Step (ii) of Option B is not high-yield for the required ortho isomer. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient pathway is the only correct choice when all other options are chemically impossible. The flaw lies in the question's premise, not in the chemical logic of sequence B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct answer, a systematic analysis of each proposed reaction sequence is required. The goal is to find the single most plausible pathway for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene, while considering the \"high-yield\" constraint.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), and -NO₂ (nitro).\n*   **Key Challenges:**\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is very bulky, which makes substitution at the adjacent *ortho* positions (like position 3 relative to position 2) difficult. Standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors the *para* position.\n    *   **Regiochemistry:** The synthesis must correctly install three different groups in a specific 1,2,3-pattern, managing the directing effects of each substituent at every stage.\n    *   **\"High-Yield\" Constraint:** This implies that steps producing significant amounts of unwanted isomers, requiring separation of a minor product, should be avoided.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nThe most effective method is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence proceeds to form a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) and are not stable enough to serve as substrates for nitration. They would decompose under the harsh acidic conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`) in step (iv).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The substrate produced after step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which is not an amine. The reaction is attempted on the wrong functional group in an illogical order.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n**3. Validate the Remaining Plausible Option**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) Nitration:** This is the key regiochemical step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n        5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to form a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted with base and ethyl bromide to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they each contain at least one chemically impossible reaction. Option B is the only sequence where every step is a valid chemical transformation that leads to the named target molecule.\n\nThe conflict arises with the \"high-yield\" condition. Step (ii) of Option B is not high-yield for the required *ortho* isomer. However, in a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient pathway must be chosen over pathways that are chemically impossible. The flaw lies in the question's premise, not in the chemical logic of sequence B. By elimination, it is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to identify the correct reaction sequence, from the given options, that leads to the synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** starting from benzene. A key, but potentially conflicting, constraint is that the synthesis should be \"high-yield\".\n\n### **2. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges**\n\n*   **Structure:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Careful Point 1: Steric Hindrance.** The tert-butyl group is exceptionally bulky. This creates significant steric hindrance, making it very difficult to introduce new substituents at the adjacent *ortho* positions (in this case, positions 1 and 3 relative to the tert-butyl group).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"High-Yield\" Constraint.** Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors substitution at the distant *para* position to avoid steric clash. Any pathway that requires substitution *ortho* to the tert-butyl group will likely be a low-yield process. This creates a potential conflict with the \"high-yield\" requirement in the question. The correct answer must be chemically possible above all else.\n\n### **3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will analyze each option for chemical feasibility. A single impossible or nonsensical step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence is written in a nonsensical order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary amine, but the reduction to an amine (`viii) Fe/HCl`) occurs much later. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (`vi) HNO3/H2SO4` immediately after forming one in step `v`). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under these conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction is impossible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only sequence without a fatal flaw. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **Step iv (Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity):** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a valid and regioselective step.\n        5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (Valid)\n        7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core sequence (i-vii) is chemically sound and is the only one that leads to the named product. The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the correct synthesis that has already been completed.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy elimination, Options A, B, and C are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option D is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible series of transformations that successfully produces the target molecule. Although the synthesis is not truly \"high-yield\" due to the poor regioselectivity in step (ii), it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices. In such a scenario, the chemically possible route must be chosen over the impossible ones.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
