    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Radius.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit around a star is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital radius).\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem states that the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets (`A = 0.3`). Therefore, all terms except `a` are constant for the planets in this system. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a`\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital radii.**\n    From the relationship above, we can write the ratio of temperatures for two planets as:\n    `T_eq_i / T_eq_j = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)`\n    Rearranging this to solve for the ratio of the radii gives:\n    `a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)²`\n\n    We are given the following temperature ratios:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n    *   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n\n    Using these values, we can find the ratios of the orbital radii:\n    *   `a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = 1.4² = 1.96`\n    *   `a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = 2.3² = 5.29`\n\n    To find the ratio of the orbital radius of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (`a3 / a1`), we multiply the two ratios we just found:\n    `a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law.**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`):\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    This holds true when the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard and safe assumption in this context. The information about the planet masses is extraneous.\n    From this proportionality, we can derive the relationship for the ratio of periods:\n    `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n    Therefore:\n    `P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the final ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    Now, we substitute the value of `a3 / a1` we found in step 2 into the equation from step 3:\n    `P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)`\n    Let's compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a3/a1 was found to be 10.3684\na_ratio_31 = 10.3684\n\n# According to Kepler's Third Law, the ratio of orbital periods P3/P1 is (a3/a1)^(3/2)\nP_ratio_31 = a_ratio_31**(1.5)\n\nprint(P_ratio_31)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 33.386.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The calculated value `33.386` is closest to option B.\n\n    *   A) ~ 10.4 (This is the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a3/a1`)\n    *   B) ~ 33.4\n    *   C) ~ 3.2 (This is approximately `sqrt(a3/a1)`)\n    *   D) ~ 4.4\n\nThe correct answer is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature `T_eq` of a planet is related to its orbital semi-major axis `a` by the following proportionality, assuming the star's properties and the planet's albedo are constant:\n`T_eq ∝ 1 / √a`\n\nFrom this, we can establish a relationship for the ratio of temperatures between two planets, `i` and `j`:\n`(T_eq_i / T_eq_j) = √(a_j / a_i)`\n\nBy squaring both sides, we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n`(a_j / a_i) = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)²`\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n1.  `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n2.  `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n\nUsing these, we can find the ratios of the orbital radii:\n*   `a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = 1.4² = 1.96`\n*   `a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = 2.3² = 5.29`\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital radius of Planet 3 to Planet 1 (`a3 / a1`), we can multiply the two ratios we just calculated:\n`a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates a planet's orbital period `P` to its semi-major axis `a`:\n`P² ∝ a³`\nThis can be written as `P ∝ a^(3/2)`. The information about the masses of the planets is not needed for this calculation, as the planets' masses are negligible compared to their host star.\n\nThe ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 and Planet 1 is therefore:\n`P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)`\n\nSubstituting the value we found for `a3 / a1`:\n`P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)`\n\nThe calculation was performed using the code interpreter:\n`10.3684 ** 1.5 ≈ 33.386`\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 3.2\nD) ~ 4.4\n\nThe calculated factor matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
