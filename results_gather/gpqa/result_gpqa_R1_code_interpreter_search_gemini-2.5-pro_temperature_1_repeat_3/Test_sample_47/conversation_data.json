    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the acid-catalyzed α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone is a symmetrical ketone, so the bromine atom will add to one of the α-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis step involves an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH) and heat. There are two main possible reaction pathways:\n1.  **E2 Elimination:** The hydroxide ion acts as a base to remove a proton from the β-carbon (C3), leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-enone.\n2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** The hydroxide ion removes a more acidic proton from the other α-carbon (the α'-carbon, C6). The resulting enolate undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction to form a bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one). This strained intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide, leading to ring opening and contraction. The final product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-bromocyclohexanone is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Which pathway is favored?**\nThe protons at the α'-position (C6, pKa ≈ 19) are significantly more acidic than the protons at the β-position (C3, pKa ≈ 45-50). A strong base like NaOH will preferentially deprotonate the most acidic position, which is C6. This initiates the Favorskii rearrangement. Therefore, the Favorskii rearrangement is the major and expected pathway under these conditions.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard and highly efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagent:** SOCl₂, pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We need to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in this molecule, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Due to rapid ring flipping, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group and the C1 carbon to which it is attached, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The single proton of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **Methine Proton:** The single proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the aldehyde group) is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The C2 and C5 carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. On each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons (e.g., on C2) are diastereotopic because they are on a prochiral center in a chiral molecule (C1 is a stereocenter). This means they are chemically non-equivalent. However, the symmetry plane makes the \"cis\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5. This results in two distinct signals for these four protons. (2 types)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the C3 and C4 carbons are equivalent due to symmetry. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. By the same logic as above, this gives two distinct signals for these four protons. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n*   C1-H: 1 type\n*   C2/C5-H's: 2 types\n*   C3/C4-H's: 2 types\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
