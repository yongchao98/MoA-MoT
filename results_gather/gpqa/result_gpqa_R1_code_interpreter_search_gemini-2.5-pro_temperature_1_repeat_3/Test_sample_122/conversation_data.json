    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta in the reference frame of the Galaxy.\n\n### **1. Identify the given information:**\n*   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame (proper time), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n### **2. Determine the physical principle:**\nThe problem involves two different inertial reference frames moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The key concept here is **time dilation**. A clock moving relative to an observer is measured to tick slower than a clock that is at rest with the observer.\n\n*   The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is the proper time, `Δt₀`.\n*   The time measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame) is the dilated time, `Δt`.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is given by:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n### **3. Formulate the calculation steps:**\n1.  Calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (`β = v/c`).\n2.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n3.  Calculate the dilated time (`Δt`) in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n4.  Calculate the distance (`d`) traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame using the formula `d = v * Δt`.\n\n### **4. Execute the calculations:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate β**\n`β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the dilated time (Δt)**\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the distance (d)**\nThe distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity in that frame multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame.\n`d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final value, we'll compute `sqrt(0.96)` and perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt0 = 50  # s (proper time in ejecta's frame)\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is d = v * dt,\n# where dt is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n# The time dt is related to the proper time dt0 by the time dilation formula:\n# dt = gamma * dt0, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2).\n# So, d = v * gamma * dt0 = v * dt0 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nbeta_sq = (v/c)**2\ndistance = (v * dt0) / math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.175778811\n>>>\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.\n\n### **5. Compare with the given options:**\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option B. The slight difference is due to rounding in the option.\n\n**Alternative check (Qualitative Reasoning):**\nA non-relativistic calculation would give the distance as `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C).\nDue to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy sees the ejecta's clock running slow. This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, more than 50 seconds pass in the Galaxy's frame. Therefore, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame must be greater than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Only option B is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a classic problem in special relativity involving time dilation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   Frame S: The Galaxy's reference frame (considered stationary).\n    *   Frame S': The ejecta's reference frame (moving relative to the Galaxy).\n\n2.  **Identify the given quantities:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame), which is the proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of time dilation:**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly in a moving frame (the ejecta). This means the time interval `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame will be longer than the proper time `Δt₀` measured in the ejecta's frame.\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the calculations:**\n    *   **First, calculate the ratio `v/c` (often denoted as `β`):**\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   **Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   **Then, calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    *   **Finally, calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the final expression:**\n    *   The Python code executed in the previous step calculated this value precisely: `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of ~3,062,000 km is closest to option B. The difference is due to rounding in the option value.\n\n**Quick Sanity Check:**\nIf we ignore relativity, the distance would simply be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C). Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is *longer* than 50 seconds, so the distance covered must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. This immediately eliminates options A, C, and D, leaving B as the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
