    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2 using the Mass Percentage of Fluorine.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), and the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\n    The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 18.998 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    0.3196 = (n * 18.998) / (M_Y + n * 18.998)\n    Let's rearrange to solve for the atomic mass of Y (M_Y):\n    M_Y + n * 18.998 = (n * 18.998) / 0.3196\n    M_Y = (n * 18.998 / 0.3196) - (n * 18.998)\n    M_Y = n * 18.998 * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M_Y ≈ n * 40.45\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer n (oxidation state) that satisfy this relationship. We can test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca at 40.08 g/mol)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (closest is Br at 79.90 g/mol)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb at 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (closest is Dy at 162.50 g/mol)\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Bi at 208.98 g/mol)\n\n    Let's calculate the exact fluorine percentage for the most promising candidate, Antimony (Sb) with n=3.\n    Y = Sb (M_Y = 121.76 g/mol), A2 = SbF3.\n    ɷF in SbF3 = (3 * 18.998) / (121.76 + 3 * 18.998) = 56.994 / 178.754 = 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a relative difference of only about 0.25%. This is a very strong indication that Y is Sb and A2 is SbF3.\n\n2.  **Identify the Other Compounds based on Y=Sb.**\n    *   **A2 = SbF3**.\n    *   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride of antimony. The most common and stable higher fluoride is SbF5. So, **A1 = SbF5**. The reaction is SbF5 → SbF3 + F2.\n    *   **Contradictions**: The problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes at 293 K and \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\". SbF5 is a colorless liquid, is relatively stable at 293 K (decomposes at higher temperatures), and while a strong oxidizer, its reaction with xenon is not as famously spontaneous as PtF6. In complex chemical puzzles, it's common for some qualitative descriptions to be slightly inaccurate or misleading, whereas numerical data is usually precise. Given the excellent numerical fit, we proceed with the Y=Sb hypothesis.\n    *   **A3**: A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and can interact with xenon. Fluorinating antimony can produce SbF3 or SbF5. Since it interacts with xenon (implying strong oxidizing/Lewis acidic properties), **A3 = SbF5**. This is consistent with A1=A3.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: A5 is obtained by adding Y (Sb) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. A4 is one of the five binary fluorides. For antimony, the main two are SbF3 and SbF5.\n\n3.  **Determine A4 by Checking the Answer Options.**\n    We need to find the molecular weight range for A4. Let's calculate the molecular weights of the possible compounds for A4 (SbF3 and SbF5) and see which one fits the given ranges.\n    *   **MW of SbF3**: 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    *   **MW of SbF5**: 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n    Now, let's look at the options:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 220-240\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.754 g/mol) falls squarely into range **A) 160-180**.\n    The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.75 g/mol) does not fit into any of the provided ranges.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, A4 must be SbF3. This is consistent with the clues: SbF3 is a white solid that can form a colorless solution in a suitable solvent (like HF). The reaction SbF3 + Sb → A5 (\"Sb2F3\") is a plausible comproportionation in a hot solution/melt. The resulting sub-fluoride (A5) would be expected to decompose in water into two substances (e.g., Sb metal and an Sb(III) compound) via disproportionation, which also fits the description.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is approximately 179 g/mol, which falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>"
