    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let's break down the name to understand the structure. \"hexan-3-one\" indicates a six-carbon chain with a ketone group at carbon 3. \"5-methoxy\" means a -OCH3 group is attached to carbon 5. \"(S)\" specifies the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is carbon 5 (it's bonded to H, CH3, OCH3, and a larger alkyl ketone group).\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (CH-OH). The acidic workup is to protonate the resulting alkoxide ion.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at the C3 ketone. The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration. The reduction of the planar sp2-hybridized carbonyl carbon at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of both (R) and (S) configurations at C3.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** This reaction produces two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since one stereocenter is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**. So, Reaction I yields a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical molecule with two ketone groups. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the alkoxides.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new chiral centers. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine the symmetry. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers have an internal plane of symmetry, making them an achiral **meso compound**. They are the same molecule.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction will produce an optically inactive mixture. This means the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture), along with the meso compound. Therefore, Reaction II yields **three stereoisomeric products**: the (2R,4R)/(2S,4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n*   **Separability:**\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot** be separated by normal-phase HPLC. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **can** be separated.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) have different properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are inseparable on an achiral column. This gives **1 peak**.\n    3.  The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are also structurally different from those of Reaction II, so they will be well separated. The total number of peaks is the sum of the separable groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from enantiomers of Rxn II) + 1 (from meso of Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. The interactions between each enantiomer and the chiral stationary phase are diastereomeric in nature, resulting in different retention times.\n*   **Separability:** Chiral HPLC can separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in our combined product mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct, a chiral HPLC column is designed to resolve them all. Therefore, we would expect to see **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
