    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** This is a relativistic collision problem involving particle annihilation. The key principles are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum, as described by the theory of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Define the initial state (before collision):**\n    *   We have an electron (e-) and a positron (e+). They have the same rest mass, which we'll call `m_e`. The speed of light is `c`.\n    *   The energy of a particle with rest mass `m` and Lorentz factor `γ` is `E = γmc^2`.\n    *   The momentum of such a particle is `p = sqrt(E^2/c^2 - m^2c^2) = sqrt((γmc^2)^2/c^2 - m^2c^2) = sqrt(γ^2 - 1) * mc`.\n\n    *   **Electron (e-):**\n        *   Moves from the left, so its momentum is in the positive x-direction.\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n        *   Energy `E_e = 4 * m_e * c^2`.\n        *   Momentum `p_e = sqrt(4^2 - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c`.\n\n    *   **Positron (e+):**\n        *   Moves from the right, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction.\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.\n        *   Energy `E_p = 2 * m_e * c^2`.\n        *   Momentum `p_p = -sqrt(2^2 - 1) * m_e * c = -sqrt(3) * m_e * c`.\n\n    *   **Total initial energy and momentum:**\n        *   Total Energy `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2`.\n        *   Total Momentum `p_initial = p_e + p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`. This momentum is entirely in the x-direction. The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n\n3.  **Define the final state (after annihilation):**\n    *   We have two photons (γ1 and γ2).\n    *   Photons are massless, so their energy `E_γ` and momentum `p_γ` are related by `E_γ = p_γ * c`.\n    *   The problem states the photons have the same energy, so `E_γ1 = E_γ2 = E_γ`.\n    *   Because the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero, the final y-momentum must also be zero. For this to happen with two photons of equal energy, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the initial direction of motion (the x-axis). Let's call this angle `θ`.\n        *   Photon 1 moves at an angle `+θ` to the x-axis.\n        *   Photon 2 moves at an angle `-θ` to the x-axis.\n\n    *   **Momentum components for the photons:**\n        *   x-component: `p_γ1_x = p_γ * cos(θ)` and `p_γ2_x = p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n        *   y-component: `p_γ1_y = p_γ * sin(θ)` and `p_γ2_y = p_γ * sin(-θ) = -p_γ * sin(θ)`.\n\n    *   **Total final energy and momentum:**\n        *   Total Energy `E_final = E_γ1 + E_γ2 = 2 * E_γ`.\n        *   Total x-momentum `p_final_x = p_γ1_x + p_γ2_x = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n        *   Total y-momentum `p_final_y = p_γ1_y + p_γ2_y = p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0`. (This confirms our symmetrical angle assumption).\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        *   `E_initial = E_final`\n        *   `6 m_e c^2 = 2 * E_γ`\n        *   `E_γ = 3 m_e c^2`. This is the energy of each photon.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum (x-direction):**\n        *   `p_initial = p_final_x`\n        *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`\n        *   We know `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3 m_e c^2) / c = 3 m_e c`. Substitute this into the equation:\n        *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n        *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the angle:**\n    *   Cancel the common `m_e * c` term from both sides:\n        *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n    *   Isolate `cos(θ)`:\n        *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n    *   The angle we found, `θ`, is the angle of each photon relative to the horizontal axis. The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`.\n    *   We need to calculate `2 * arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`.\n\nLet's perform the final calculation using a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in degrees\n# theta is the angle of one photon with respect to the horizontal axis\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_theta))\n\n# The angle between the two photons is 2 * theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_degrees\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\n>>>138.1887012580191\n\nThe calculated angle between the photons is approximately 138.19 degrees.
