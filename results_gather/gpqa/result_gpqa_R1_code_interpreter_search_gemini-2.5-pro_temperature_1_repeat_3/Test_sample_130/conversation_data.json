    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its ¹³C spectrum.\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride. Due to the molecule's symmetry (a C₂v symmetry plane), the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent. This would result in a single peak (a singlet) in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for vinylic protons attached to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   Similarly, the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent. This leads to two signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. The chemical shift of ~137 ppm is in the alkene region (C=C), and ~165 ppm is in the carbonyl region (C=O).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is formed when the dienophile approaches the diene such that its electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride part) are tucked \"under\" the forming cyclohexene ring, pointing towards the diene's π-system. The endo product is usually the kinetically favored product, meaning it is formed faster and is typically the **major product**.\n    *   The *exo* product is formed when the electron-withdrawing groups point \"away\" from the π-system. The exo product is usually more thermodynamically stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n*   The products are bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivatives. The major product is the *endo* adduct, and the minor product is the *exo* adduct. The molecular formula of the products is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ diene + C₄H₂O₃ anhydride), which matches the problem statement.\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure and Predicted NMR Signals of the Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structure of the product, 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n\nThere are four distinct sets of protons that will appear as singlets due to the molecule's symmetry:\n*   **Anhydride Protons (Ha):** The two protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride (C2 and C3). They are equivalent. These are methine protons adjacent to carbonyl groups. Expected chemical shift: ~3-4 ppm. The problem provides a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (Hb):** The two methyl groups attached to the double bond (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent. Expected chemical shift for vinylic methyls: ~1.5-2.0 ppm. The problem provides a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Hd):** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). They are equivalent. Expected chemical shift for saturated methyl groups on a quaternary carbon: ~1.0-1.5 ppm. The problem provides a **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n*   **Bridge Methylene Protons (Hc):** The two protons of the CH₂ bridge at C7. These are not relevant to the options involving only singlets.\n\n**4. Use NOESY Spectroscopy to Differentiate the Products**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak appears between the signals of two protons if they are spatially close.\n\nThe problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial distance changes significantly between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n*   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same face) to the C5=C6 double bond. This means the anhydride protons (**Ha**, ~3.5 ppm) are located on the same side of the molecule as the vinylic methyl groups (**Hb**, ~1.7 ppm). They are close in space. **Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between Ha and Hb is expected.**\n\n*   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite face) to the C5=C6 double bond. This means the anhydride protons (**Ha**, ~3.5 ppm) are far away from the vinylic methyl groups (**Hb**, ~1.7 ppm). **Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between Ha and Hb should be absent or very weak.**\n\nThis exactly matches the description in the problem. The cross-peak that differentiates the major and minor products is the one connecting the anhydride protons (Ha) and the vinylic methyl protons (Hb).\n\n**5. Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\n*   The cross-peak connects the resonance for the anhydride protons (**Ha**: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the resonance for the vinylic methyl protons (**Hb**: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal description.\n*   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal description.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This matches our identified protons Hb and Ha.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This corresponds to the bridgehead methyls (Hd) and vinylic methyls (Hb). While an NOE might exist, it wouldn't be the key differentiating peak as their relative distance doesn't change as dramatically as the Ha-Hb distance between the two isomers.\n\nThus, the cross-peak present in the major product's spectrum connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
