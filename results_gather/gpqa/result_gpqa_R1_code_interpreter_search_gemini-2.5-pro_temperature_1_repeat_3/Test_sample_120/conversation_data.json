    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` means the atom at position 7 (the single-atom bridge) is an oxygen. This confirms the structure is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` specifies the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. This reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Apply the Rules of Epoxide Opening with Organocuprates**\n\nThe problem statement provides two crucial rules for this reaction:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (the alkyl group from the organocuprate) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2-like mechanism**, which means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack). This results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6, and the oxygen atom.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group (`1-trimethyl`).\n*   Carbon C6 is only substituted with a hydrogen atom (and is part of the cyclohexane ring).\n*   Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**. The nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Attack:** The CH₃⁻ nucleophile attacks C6.\n*   **Ring Opening:** The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks. The resulting intermediate is an alkoxide, with the oxygen still attached to C1. A subsequent aqueous workup (implied in such reactions) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The final product is a cyclohexanol.\n*   **Fate of Chiral Centers:**\n    *   **C3 and C4:** These carbons are not involved in the reaction. Their stereochemistry is unchanged. They remain **(3R)** and **(4R)**.\n    *   **C1:** The C1-O bond breaks, but no bonds attached directly to the chiral center C1 are broken or formed in a way that would invert its configuration. The stereochemistry at C1 is **retained**. It remains **(1R)**. The oxygen atom becomes an -OH group.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is attacked by the nucleophile. According to the SN2 rule, its configuration is **inverted**. The starting configuration is **(6S)**, so the new configuration at this center will be **(R)**.\n\n**5. Name the Product and Assign Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Structure:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:\n    *   An -OH group and a -CH₃ group on the original C1.\n    *   A new -CH₃ group (from the reagent) on the original C6.\n    *   A -CH₃ group on the original C3.\n    *   A -CH₃ group on the original C4.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the carbon it is attached to (the original C1) is designated as C1 in the product's name. The molecule is a `cyclohexan-1-ol`.\n    *   We have four methyl groups in total. To give the substituents the lowest possible locant numbers, we number the ring starting from C1 and proceeding towards the next substituent. The original C6 (which now has a methyl group) is adjacent to the new C1. Numbering in that direction (C1 -> original C6) gives the substituent positions as 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Numbering correspondence:\n        *   Product C1 ← Reactant C1\n        *   Product C2 ← Reactant C6\n        *   Product C4 ← Reactant C4\n        *   Product C5 ← Reactant C3\n    *   The systematic name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n*   **Assigning Stereochemistry to the Product Name:**\n    *   Configuration at Product C1 (from reactant C1): Retained as **(1R)**.\n    *   Configuration at Product C2 (from reactant C6): Inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   Configuration at Product C4 (from reactant C4): Retained as **(4R)**.\n    *   Configuration at Product C5 (from reactant C3): Retained as **(5R)**.\n\n*   **Final Product Name:** Putting it all together, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived result with the given options:\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect name and stereochemistry.\n*   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **This matches our result perfectly.**\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect name and stereochemistry.\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (shows retention instead of inversion).\n\n<<<B>>>"
