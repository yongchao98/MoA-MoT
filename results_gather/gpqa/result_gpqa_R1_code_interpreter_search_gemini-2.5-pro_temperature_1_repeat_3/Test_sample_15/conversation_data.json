    "An optically active compound is a chiral molecule that can rotate the plane of polarized light. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound to determine its chirality and thus its potential for optical activity.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule must lack an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. The atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C(CH3), C(CH2CH3)) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name of this compound includes stereochemical descriptors for absolute configuration: `(3aR, 7aS)`.\n    *   The designation of R and S configurations specifies a particular stereoisomer. When a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule is named, it is by definition chiral.\n    *   A sample consisting of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (H, CH3, COOH, -CH(CH3)COOH) are identical to the substituents on C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as (2R, 3S), meaning the two stereocenters have opposite configurations.\n    *   A compound with multiple stereocenters that is achiral is called a meso compound. This typically occurs when the stereocenters have opposite configurations (one R, one S) and have identical sets of substituents.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion and is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The configuration is (2R, 3R), meaning both stereocenters have the same configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. These two form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The name specifies the absolute configuration `(R)` at one of the carbons (C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This molecule is conformationally flexible. Its most stable conformations are two interconverting chairs. Both of these chair conformations are chiral (they belong to the C3 point group).\n    *   However, a molecule is considered achiral if it can easily access any achiral conformation. The process of ring-flipping in cyclohexane passes through higher-energy boat and twist-boat conformations. For the all-cis-1,3,5-triol, there exists an accessible boat conformation that possesses a plane of symmetry (a C_s point group).\n    *   Because the molecule can readily pass through an achiral conformation, the chiral conformers rapidly interconvert, resulting in a racemic mixture that cannot be resolved. Thus, the compound as a whole is considered achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is then attached to an isobutyl group: `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. There are none. All carbons are bonded to at least two identical groups (e.g., two H's on a CH2, or two CH3's on the CH).\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotation. It is possible to find a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisect both the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group.\n    *   Since the molecule has no stereocenters and has accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
