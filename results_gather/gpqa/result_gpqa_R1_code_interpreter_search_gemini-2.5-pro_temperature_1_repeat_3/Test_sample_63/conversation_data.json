    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the reaction and identify the products.**\n\n*   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B (total mass = 7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a gas mixture. This means no solid residue is left.\n*   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes:\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This implies the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of O₂ that reacted.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these steps, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of each product.**\n\n*   **Moles of H₂O:**\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol H₂O\n\n*   **Moles of O₂:**\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol O₂\n\n*   **Moles and identity of Gas C:**\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol Gas C.\n    *   We can find the mass of Gas C by the law of conservation of mass:\n        *   Mass of Gas C = Total initial mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n        *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). This makes sense, as many nitrogen-containing salts decompose to produce N₂ gas.\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: **0.20 mol H₂O**, **0.025 mol O₂**, and **0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n**3. Determine the composition of the original salts.**\n\nThe salts A and B must contain the elements found in the products: Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n\nLet's find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of H:** 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H\n*   **Moles of N:** 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N\n*   **Moles of O:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nWe are looking for two salts (A and B) containing H, N, and O that decompose on heating to give H₂O, O₂, and N₂. Ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids are likely candidates. Let's consider:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): Decomposes as NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): At higher temperatures (~250-300°C), it can decompose as 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the mixture consists of **NH₄NO₂ (Salt A)** and **NH₄NO₃ (Salt B)**. Since the mixture is equimolar, let's say it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `n` mol N₂ + `0.5n` mol O₂ + `2n` mol H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5n\n\nNow, let's compare this with our experimental results:\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Total N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches the experiment)\n*   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches the experiment)\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**5. Verify the total mass.**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.2 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g (Matches the initial mass)\n\n**6. Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B** (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
