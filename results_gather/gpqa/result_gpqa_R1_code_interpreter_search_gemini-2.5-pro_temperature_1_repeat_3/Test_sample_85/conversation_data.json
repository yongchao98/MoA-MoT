    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this name to understand the structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. The oxygen atom is at position 1. This functional group is a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O(1)----C(=O)(2)\n     /         \\\n   CH2(6)      CH2(3)\n   |           |\n  CH2(5)------CH(Et)(4)\n```\nThe carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (not drawn), an ethyl group, a -CH2C(=O)- group, and a -CH2CH2O- group. The problem specifies the stereochemistry at this center: (R) for the product from reaction A, and (S) for the product from reaction B.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's deconstruct this name. This is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid (3-ethylpentanedioic acid) where one of the carboxylic acid groups has been converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n     Et\n     |\nHOOC-CH2-CH-CH2-COO-iBu\n 1    2    3   4    5\n```\nThis molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has a single chiral center at carbon 3, which is the carbon bonded to the ethyl group. The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reducing agent has a special affinity for carboxylic acids. It selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1 (with LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (-COO-iBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) untouched.\n    ```\n         Et                     Et\n         |                      |\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu  ->  HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    (Starting Material A)       (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the hydroxyl (-OH) group at one end of the molecule attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group at the other end. This is an intramolecular esterification that forms the six-membered lactone ring and eliminates a molecule of water.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical transformations (reduction of the ester at C5 and cyclization involving C1 and the C5-OH) do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material's chiral center is preserved in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the chiral center (C4 in the lactone, which was C3 in the starting material) must have the (R) configuration. This means starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2 (with BH₃)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group (-COO-iBu) untouched.\n    ```\n         Et                      Et\n         |                       |\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu  ->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu\n    (Starting Material B)        (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the newly formed hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the ester carbonyl. This is an intramolecular transesterification that forms the same six-membered lactone ring and eliminates a molecule of isobutanol (iBu-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, these transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is preserved.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the chiral center must have the (S) configuration. This means starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\n*   Starting Material A = **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
