    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-X) as either activating or deactivating, and determine its directing effect (ortho, para-directing or meta-directing).\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):**\n    *   Substituent: -CH3 (methyl)\n    *   Classification: Activating group (donates electron density via induction and hyperconjugation).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Ortho, para-director**.\n\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):**\n    *   Substituent: -COOC2H5 (ester)\n    *   Classification: Deactivating group (withdraws electron density via resonance).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Meta-director**.\n\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):**\n    *   Substituent: -Cl (chloro)\n    *   Classification: Deactivating group (strong inductive withdrawal outweighs weak resonance donation).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Ortho, para-director** (due to resonance).\n\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):**\n    *   Substituent: -NO2 (nitro)\n    *   Classification: Strongly deactivating group (withdraws electron density via induction and resonance).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Meta-director**.\n\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):**\n    *   Substituent: -C2H5 (ethyl)\n    *   Classification: Activating group (donates electron density via induction and hyperconjugation).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Ortho, para-director**.\n\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):**\n    *   Substituent: -COOH (carboxylic acid)\n    *   Classification: Deactivating group (withdraws electron density via resonance).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Meta-director**.\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer will be inversely related to the strength of the deactivating (and thus meta-directing) effect. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe meta-directing substances are:\n*   4) C6H5-NO2\n*   6) C6H5-COOH\n*   2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n\nThe general order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the group that deactivates the most (-NO2) will yield the least para-isomer, and the group that deactivates the least among these three (-COOC2H5) will yield the most (though still a very small amount).\n\nThe order of increasing para-isomer yield for this subset is:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances\n\nThe substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer depends on steric and electronic factors.\n\nThe ortho, para-directing substances are:\n*   1) C6H5-CH3\n*   5) C6H5-C2H5\n*   3) C6H5-Cl\n\nLet's compare them:\n\n*   **1 (-CH3) vs. 5 (-C2H5):** Both are alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack of the electrophile (Br+) at the nearby ortho positions more effectively, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Consequently, ethylbenzene will have a higher para/ortho ratio and a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** The chloro group is an ortho, para-director, but it is deactivating. Its directing effect is governed by a balance of a strong, distance-dependent inductive withdrawal (-I effect) and a resonance donation (+R effect). The -I effect deactivates all positions, but it is strongest at the ortho positions and weakest at the para position. This electronic effect strongly favors substitution at the para position over the ortho position, leading to a very high para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (around 89% in bromination). This yield is typically higher than that for toluene (~67%). The trend of increasing para yield with alkyl group size (CH3 < C2H5 < t-butyl) shows that for t-butylbenzene, the para yield is about 84%. It is reasonable to assume the para yield for ethylbenzene will be between that of toluene (67%) and t-butylbenzene (84%), and therefore less than that of chlorobenzene (89%).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Orders\n\nNow we combine the two groups. The meta-directors (4, 6, 2) produce extremely low yields of the para-isomer (typically <5%), while the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3) produce high yields (typically >60%). Therefore, all meta-directors will come before all ortho, para-directors in the final ranking.\n\nCombining the orders from Step 2 and Step 3:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
