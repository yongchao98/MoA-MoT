    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** A moving particle $X^0$ decays after traveling some distance in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber).\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** This is the average lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame, given as $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime. This is described by the formula $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Decay Length (L):** The average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is the mean decay length, $L$. It is given by $L = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. For relativistic particles, this is $L = \\beta c \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n*   **Observing a Decay:** In a detector like a bubble chamber, a neutral particle ($X^0$) leaves no track, while the charged decay products ($Y^+$, $Z^-$) do. To \"observe\" the decay as an event separate from the particle's creation point, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution, let's call it $d_{res}$.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ before decaying follows an exponential distribution. The probability of it traveling a distance *greater* than $d_{res}$ is $P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/L}$.\n*   **The Question's Condition:** We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means we require the probability of the decay length being greater than our resolution to be at least 0.30.\n    $P(x > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\n**2. Formulate the Calculation**\n\nFrom the condition $e^{-d_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30$, we can solve for the maximum allowable resolution $d_{res}$. A smaller resolution is better, so any resolution less than this maximum value will work. The question asks for this boundary value.\n\n$$-d_{res}/L \\ge \\ln(0.30)$$\n$$d_{res} \\le -L \\ln(0.30)$$\n$$d_{res} \\le L \\ln(1/0.30)$$\n\nSo we need to calculate $d = L \\ln(1/0.30)$.\n\nTo do this, we first need to calculate the mean decay length $L$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)**\n\nThe formula for the mean decay length is $L = \\frac{p}{m} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} c \\tau_0$, where $p$ is the momentum of the particle.\n\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   Total Energy $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest Mass Energy $mc^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Proper Lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n*   **Calculate momentum ($pc$):**\n    From the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$:\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Calculate L:**\n    Now substitute the values into the formula for L:\n    $L = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times c \\tau_0$\n    $L \\approx 7.854 \\times c \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n\n**4. Compute the Final Answer**\n\nNow we combine the steps to find the required resolution, $d$.\n\n$$d = L \\times \\ln(1/0.30) = \\left( \\frac{pc}{mc^2} c \\tau_0 \\right) \\times (-\\ln(0.30))$$\n\nLet's use a Python script for a precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given constants\nE = 27  # GeV\nm_c2 = 3.41  # GeV\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # s\nc = 299792458  # m/s\n\n# 1. Calculate the momentum in GeV\npc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m_c2**2)\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length L\n# L = (p/m) * tau_0 = (pc / mc^2) * c * tau_0\nL = (pc / m_c2) * c * tau_0\n\n# 3. Calculate the required resolution d\n# We need to observe at least 30% of decays, so P(x > d) >= 0.3\n# exp(-d/L) >= 0.3  =>  d <= -L * ln(0.3)\n# The question asks for this maximum allowable resolution.\nd = -L * np.log(0.30)\n\nprint(f\"{d:.3e}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n`2.268e-06`\n\nThe calculation gives a required resolution of $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated value is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's look at the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nThe calculated result does not exactly match any of the options. However, option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is the closest in value and has the correct order of magnitude. The discrepancy of about 9% is likely due to a typo in the problem statement's numbers (e.g., the percentage was intended to be 33% instead of 30%, which would yield $d \\approx 2.09 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). In a multiple-choice context, the best approach is to select the closest answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Physics**\n\nA neutral particle like $X^0$ does not leave a track in a bubble chamber. Its decay is \"observed\" when its charged products, $Y^+$ and $Z^-$, create new tracks originating from a point different from the creation point of $X^0$. To distinguish the decay vertex from the creation vertex, the particle $X^0$ must travel a distance 'd' that is greater than the spatial resolution of the detector, $d_{res}$.\n\nThe probability that a particle with a mean decay length 'L' travels a distance 'x' before decaying follows an exponential decay law. The probability that it travels a distance greater than $d_{res}$ is given by:\n$P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/L}$\n\nThe problem states that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This translates to the condition:\n$P(x > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-d_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the required resolution, we solve for $d_{res}$ at the boundary condition:\n$e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d_{res}/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**2. Calculating the Mean Decay Length (L)**\n\nThe mean decay length 'L' is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is related to the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) and its momentum (p) and mass (m) by the formula:\n$L = \\frac{p}{m} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\nWe are given:\n*   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $mc^2$ = 3.41 GeV\n*   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nFirst, we need to find the momentum-energy, 'pc', using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\nNow we can calculate L:\n$L = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot c \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we combine everything to find the resolution $d_{res}$:\n$d_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = - \\left( \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\right) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\nLet's use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given parameters\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm_c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau_0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\nprobability_threshold = 0.30 # We want to observe at least 30% of decays\n\n# 1. Calculate the relativistic momentum (pc) in GeV\n# E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\npc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m_c2**2)\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length (L) in meters\n# L = (pc / mc^2) * c * tau_0\nL = (pc / m_c2) * c * tau_0\n\n# 3. Calculate the required resolution (d_res)\n# We need to observe decays where the travel distance x > d_res.\n# The probability is P(x > d_res) = exp(-d_res / L).\n# We set this to our threshold: exp(-d_res / L) = 0.30\n# d_res = -L * ln(0.30)\nd_res = -L * np.log(probability_threshold)\n\nprint(f\"{d_res:.3e}\")\n```\nThe output of the code is `2.268e-06`.\n\nThis means the required resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n**4. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) 2.08 * 1e-1 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n*   B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n*   C) 2.08 * 1e-3 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n*   D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nOur calculated value of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small difference is likely due to a minor imprecision in the numbers given in the problem statement (for instance, if the requirement was to observe 33% of decays, the answer would be almost exactly 2.08e-6 m). Given the choices, D is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics and the Goal**\n\nThe problem involves the decay of a relativistic particle, $X^0$. To \"observe\" a decay in a detector like a bubble chamber, the neutral particle must travel a certain distance before it decays into charged particles (which leave tracks). This distance must be larger than the detector's spatial resolution. We are asked to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of all decays.\n\n**2. The Exponential Decay Law**\n\nThe probability that a particle with a mean decay length, L, will travel a distance, x, before decaying follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle travels a distance *greater* than a certain value, $d_{res}$ (the resolution), is given by:\n$P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/L}$\n\nThe problem requires that we observe at least 30% of the decays, which translates to the following condition:\n$P(x > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-d_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum resolution, we solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d_{res}/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**3. Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)**\n\nThe mean decay length (L) is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. It is given by the formula:\n$L = \\frac{p}{m} \\cdot \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\nwhere:\n*   p is the momentum of the particle in the lab frame.\n*   m is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime ($8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s).\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   $pc$ is the momentum-energy.\n*   $mc^2$ is the rest mass energy (3.41 GeV).\n\nWe can find the momentum-energy ($pc$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\nGiven:\n*   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $mc^2$ = 3.41 GeV\n\nNow, solve for $pc$:\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4.

The previous execution of the Python script has already performed this calculation accurately.\n\n*   $L = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot c \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThe precise result from the code was **$2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**.\n\n**5.

They share the same order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m). The small discrepancy (about 9%) is likely due to a minor inconsistency in the problem's given numbers (e.g., the probability might have been intended to be 33% instead of 30%).
