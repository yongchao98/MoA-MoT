    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between key variables:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance `d` to a star. We can write this relationship as `plx = k/d` or, for simplicity in astronomical units, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Count stars in a volume of space:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars `N` up to a certain distance `d`. These stars are contained within a sphere of radius `d`.\n    *   The volume `V` of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this sphere is `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of parallax:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the relationship `d = 1/plx` into the equation for `N`:\n        `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4πρ/3) * (1/plx³)`.\n    *   This equation gives us the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (since smaller distance `d` corresponds to larger parallax `plx`).\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks how the *number of stars per unit range of parallax* changes with `plx`. This is a differential quantity, which can be expressed as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We need to differentiate the expression for `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4πρ/3) * plx⁻³ ]`\n    *   Applying the power rule for differentiation `d(xⁿ)/dx = nxⁿ⁻¹`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ/3) * (-3 * plx⁻⁴) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴ = -4πρ / plx⁴`.\n\n5.  **Interpret the result:**\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases, the cumulative number of stars `N` decreases (which is correct according to our definition of N as the number of stars *beyond* a certain parallax). However, the question is about the number of stars *in a given parallax range*, which is a positive quantity. So we are interested in the magnitude.\n    *   `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`.\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, the relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n6.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   A) ~ 1/plx¹\n    *   B) ~ 1/plx²\n    *   C) ~ 1/plx⁴\n    *   D) ~ 1/plx³\n\n    Our derived relationship matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
