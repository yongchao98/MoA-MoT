    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two phenomena that cause a star's brightness to dim:\na) Rotational modulation due to a large, cool, spotted region on the star's surface.\nb) A planetary transit where an exoplanet passes in front of the star.\n\nWe need to find the radius of a hypothetical planet (relative to the star's radius) that would produce the same dimming effect as the starspots.\n\n**2. Model the Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nThe brightness (or flux, F) we receive from a star is related to its temperature. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the bright, unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's projected area (a disk of area A = πR_star²) and its effective temperature (T_star) to the fourth power.\n    *   `F_max ∝ A * T_star⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere has two components: a fraction `(1-f)` of the area is at the normal stellar temperature `T_star`, and a fraction `f` (the filling factor) is covered by cooler spots at temperature `T_spot`.\n    *   `f = 20% = 0.20`\n    *   `T_star = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the hot and cool parts.\n    *   `F_min ∝ [(1-f) * A * T_star⁴] + [f * A * T_spot⁴]`\n    *   `F_min ∝ A * [(1-f)T_star⁴ + fT_spot⁴]`\n\n*   **Calculate the Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude is the fractional drop in brightness, which is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   `Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n    *   `Amplitude = 1 - { A * [(1-f)T_star⁴ + fT_spot⁴] } / { A * T_star⁴ }`\n    *   The area term `A` cancels out.\n    *   `Amplitude = 1 - [(1-f) + f * (T_spot⁴ / T_star⁴)]`\n    *   `Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_star)⁴`\n    *   `Amplitude (Spots) = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]`\n\n**3. Model the Brightness Drop from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen a planet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The fractional drop in brightness is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   `Area_planet = π * R_pl²`\n*   `Area_star = π * R_star²`\n*   `Amplitude (Transit) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**4. Equate the Two Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nThe problem states that the two scenarios produce the same amplitude signal. Therefore, we can set the two expressions for the amplitude equal to each other.\n\n*   `Amplitude (Spots) = Amplitude (Transit)`\n*   `f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴] = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative planet radius, `R_pl / R_star`.\n\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴] )`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nI will now use a Python script to compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nfilling_factor = 0.20\nT_star_eff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000      # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the fractional brightness drop caused by the spots\n# This is the amplitude of the signal due to rotational modulation\n# Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4]\nspot_amplitude = filling_factor * (1 - (T_spot / T_star_eff)**4)\n\n# The brightness drop from a transiting exoplanet is (R_pl / R_star)^2\n# We set this equal to the amplitude from the spots to find the equivalent planet size\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = spot_amplitude\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(spot_amplitude)\nrelative_planet_radius = math.sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: {relative_planet_radius}\")\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nThe calculated relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: 0.3217904558045618\n```\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.3218.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spotted hemisphere is determined by the difference in flux between the unspotted hemisphere and the spotted hemisphere. The flux (F) is proportional to the effective temperature to the fourth power (F ∝ T⁴) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\n1.  **Flux from the unspotted hemisphere (Maximum Flux, F_max):**\n    This is proportional to the star's normal effective temperature.\n    `F_max ∝ T_star⁴` where `T_star = 6000 K`.\n\n2.  **Flux from the spotted hemisphere (Minimum Flux, F_min):**\n    This hemisphere has 20% (filling factor f = 0.2) of its area covered by cooler spots and the remaining 80% (1 - f) at the normal stellar temperature.\n    *   Temperature of spots, `T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the relative amplitude of the signal from spots:**\n    The relative change in brightness is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_star⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]`\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n    `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n    `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]`\n    `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355`\n\n4.  **Calculate the signal from a transiting exoplanet:**\n    The drop in brightness during a transit is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n    `Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n5.  **Equate the two amplitudes and solve for R_pl / R_star:**\n    The problem requires the two amplitudes to be the same.\n    `(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spots`\n    `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n    `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.32, which matches option C.
