    "This problem involves mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The pH of the final solution is determined by the net amount of acid or base remaining after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of H+ and OH- ions.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl -> H+ + Cl-\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-\n    *   Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 * 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will first react with the strong acid (H+ from HCl), and then with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid - Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   Moles of H+ (strong) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- (strong) = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H+ will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid - Remaining Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   Now, the remaining 0.100 mol of OH- reacts with the 0.050 mol of CH3COOH.\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   The CH3COOH will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- (a strong base). The presence of this strong base will dictate the pH. The contribution from the hydrolysis of the conjugate base, CH3COO-, is negligible.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH and pH:**\n    *   We can use a python script to do the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nmoles_excess_oh = 0.050\ntotal_volume = 1.200\n\n# Calculate the final concentration of OH-\nfinal_oh_concentration = moles_excess_oh / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(final_oh_concentration)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(pH)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical reactions and calculations:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each species:**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely, yielding two moles of OH⁻ for every mole of Ba(OH)₂ (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 * 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform neutralization reactions:**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react first with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) until one is consumed. Then, any remaining strong base will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   We have 0.080 mol of H⁺ and 0.180 mol of OH⁻. The H⁺ is the limiting reactant.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   We have 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH and 0.100 mol of OH⁻ remaining from the first reaction. The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution:**\n\nThe final solution has an excess of 0.050 moles of OH⁻, a strong base. The presence of this strong base will determine the pH.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
