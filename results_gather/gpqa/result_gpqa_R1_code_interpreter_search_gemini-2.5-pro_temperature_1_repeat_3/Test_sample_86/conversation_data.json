    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information from the Question:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible C2 groups that contain a carbonyl (C=O):\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very common substituent.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO)**: This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group (in an aldehyde).\n        *   Other possibilities like a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or a carboxylic acid group (-CH2COOH) also fit the carbon count and carbonyl requirement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data in the Options:**\n    *   Let's look for patterns. Options B and D both show a similar pattern in the aromatic region: `~7.8 (2H, d)` and `~7.6 (2H, d)`. This means there are two signals, each representing two equivalent protons, and each is a doublet. This is a classic, textbook pattern for a **para- (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other.\n    *   Options A and C do not show signals in the typical aromatic proton chemical shift range (6.5-8.5 ppm), or the patterns do not match a disubstituted benzene ring. They can be eliminated.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options (B and D) with Plausible Structures:**\n\n    *   **Candidate Structure 1: p-Haloacetophenone.**\n        *   This structure consists of a benzene ring with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3) in a para arrangement.\n        *   It fits all initial criteria: di-substituted aromatic ring, 8 total carbons (6+2), carbonyl group, and aromatic-halogen bond.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, due to the para substitution. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield. This matches the `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern.\n            *   **Aliphatic Protons:** A methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl. It has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. It will integrate to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Compare with Option D:** `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a **perfect match** for the predicted spectrum of p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **Candidate Structure 2: (p-Halophenyl)acetaldehyde.**\n        *   This structure has a halogen (-X) and a formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO) in a para arrangement.\n        *   It also fits all initial criteria.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two doublets, each for 2H. This matches the `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern.\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** A very downfield signal, typically 9-10 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet (t)**. It would integrate to **1H**.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** A signal deshielded by the ring and the carbonyl, typically ~3.5-4.0 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CHO proton, so it should be split into a **doublet (d)**. It would integrate to **2H**.\n        *   **Compare with Option B:** `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. The chemical shifts are plausible for this structure. However, the splitting pattern is incorrect. Both the aldehyde and methylene protons are listed as **singlets (s)**, not the expected triplet and doublet. While small coupling constants can sometimes appear as singlets, this is less likely and makes the data a poorer fit than option D.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The 1H NMR data in option D is a textbook, unambiguous match for p-haloacetophenone, a structure that perfectly satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. The data in option B, while corresponding to another plausible structure, has a questionable splitting pattern. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
