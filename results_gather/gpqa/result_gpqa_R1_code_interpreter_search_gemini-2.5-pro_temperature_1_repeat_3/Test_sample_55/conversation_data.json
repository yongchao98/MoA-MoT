    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition. This means there is an intermediate state, and each of the two steps must obey the E1 selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay, the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   From the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$, we have $l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   For the principal quantum number $n'$, it must be less than 3.\n    *   **Second Transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   To reach the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, we have $l_{final}=0, m_{final}=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This implies $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first step.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This implies $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, also consistent.\n    *   The energy of the intermediate state must be between the initial and final states. Since $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$, we must have $E_3 < E_{n'} < E_1$, which means $1 < n' < 3$. Thus, $n'$ must be 2.\n\n    Combining these results, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means there are three possible transition routes. All options A, B, C, and D propose valid intermediate states according to the selection rules. We need to determine the probability.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of each Route**\n    The probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios of each step in the cascade.\n\n    **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric.\n    *   The decay rate from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$, where the square indicates a sum over the components: $|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   Because the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric, the total decay rates to each of the degenerate final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal due to rotational invariance. Let's call this rate $\\Gamma_1$.\n    *   The total decay rate from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state via E1 transition is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. The only states accessible from 3s via a single E1 transition are the $np$ states with $n<3$. The only such state is the 2p level. So, the total E1 decay rate is $\\Gamma_{tot,1} = \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,-1) + \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,0) + \\Gamma(3,0,0\\to 2,1,1) = \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 = 3\\Gamma_1$.\n    *   The branching ratio (probability) for the atom to take a specific path to one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is:\n        $BR_1(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{tot,1}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_1}{3\\Gamma_1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   So, the atom has a 1/3 probability of landing in any of the three intermediate states.\n\n    **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state).\n    *   We need to find the decay channels from this state. According to the E1 selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$), a 2p state ($l=1$) can only decay to an s-state ($l=0$). The only lower-energy s-state is the 1s state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$).\n    *   Since this is the only possible decay channel for the 2p state, any atom in a 2p state will eventually decay to the 1s state with 100% probability.\n    *   Therefore, the branching ratio for this second step is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n        $BR_2(m') = 1$.\n\n    **Overall Probability**\n    The total probability for a specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,m'\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the branching ratios for each step:\n    $P(\\text{route through } m') = BR_1(m') \\times BR_2(m') = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options**\n    This result shows that all three possible routes have the same probability of 1/3.\n    *   Route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n    *   Route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = 1/3\n\n    Now we check the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n    Only option D presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>"
