    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction and equilibrium.**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, is formed from calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($EDTA^{4-}$). The complex also dissociates back into these ions. The equilibrium for the dissociation is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Understand the provided constant.**\n    The given constant is the formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, for every 'x' moles/L of complex that dissociates, 'x' moles/L of $Ca^{2+}$ and 'x' moles/L of $EDTA^{4-}$ are formed.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.**\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x.**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex.\n    Therefore, we can make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Finally, solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n6.  **Verify the assumption.**\n    The calculated value for x ($6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M) is indeed much smaller than 0.02 M, so the approximation was valid.\n\n7.  **Compare with the options.**\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, matches option D.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = (initial_complex_conc - x) / (x * x)\n# Since K_f is very large, x will be very small.\n# We can approximate (initial_complex_conc - x) as initial_complex_conc.\n# So, K_f ≈ initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# Rearranging for x^2: x^2 ≈ initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\n# Calculate x^2\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\n# Calculate x, which is the concentration of Ca2+ ions\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{x:.1e}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves the equilibrium of the calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex can dissociate into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($EDTA^{4-}$). The reaction for this dissociation is:\n\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Use the Formation Constant (K_f)**\n\nWe are given the formation constant ($K_f$), which describes the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe expression for the formation constant is:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n**3. Set Up an ICE Table**\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex and assume that some amount, 'x', dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is 'x'.\n\n**4. Solve for 'x'**\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the equation with the approximation:\n\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x':\n\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x \\approx \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x', which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches the result from the code execution (`6.3e-07`).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5.0x10^-3 M\nB) 2.0x10^-2 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
