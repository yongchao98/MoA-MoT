    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    *   The reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n    *   Let's break down the structure to understand its components and calculate its initial IHD.\n        *   \"cyclohex-3-ene\": A six-membered ring with one double bond (C=C). This contributes 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the double bond) = 2 to the IHD.\n        *   \"carboxylic acid\" (-COOH): This group contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n        *   \"formyl\" (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n        *   \"vinyl\" (-CH=CH2): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n    *   **Calculate the IHD of the reactant:**\n        *   IHD = (from ring) + (from C=C in ring) + (from C=O in acid) + (from C=O in formyl) + (from C=C in vinyl)\n        *   IHD_reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n    *   Alternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and use the IHD formula.\n        *   Carbon atoms (C): 6 (in the ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in -CH=CH2) = 10 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen atoms (H): A detailed count gives C10H12O3.\n        *   IHD Formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n        *   IHD_reactant = 10 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n        Both methods confirm the IHD of the reactant is 5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reagent is **red phosphorus and excess HI (Red P + HI)**.\n    *   This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its primary function is to perform a complete reduction of a molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n    *   It reduces:\n        *   Aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n        *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n        *   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Crucially, this reaction does not break stable ring structures like cyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    *   The reaction will reduce all the functional groups and double bonds in the starting material but will leave the carbon skeleton, including the ring, intact.\n    *   The cyclohex-3-ene ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C is reduced).\n    *   The carboxylic acid, formyl, and vinyl groups are all reduced, becoming alkyl substituents on the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The final product is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon**. Specifically, it will be 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane (the exact name is not needed, only the structural class).\n\n4.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n    *   The product is a saturated molecule, meaning it has no double or triple bonds.\n    *   It does, however, still contain one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is defined as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds.\n    *   IHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n    *   IHD_product = 1 (for the cyclohexane ring) + 0 (since all double bonds were reduced) = 1.\n\n    *   Alternatively, using the molecular formula:\n        *   The product is a C10 saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for such a compound is CnH(2n).\n        *   Therefore, the product's formula is C10H20.\n        *   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n        *   IHD_product = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nConclusion: The index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
