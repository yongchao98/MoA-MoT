    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid to Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid is brominated at the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis used to form a cyclic compound.\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent cyano and ester groups. This forms an enolate: [NC-CH-COOEt]-.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction. This forms an alkylated intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    3.  Since excess NaH is used, this intermediate is also deprotonated at the α-carbon, forming a new enolate: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]-.\n    4.  This enolate then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The question specifies that we should count all chemically distinct hydrogens, even if their signals are very close.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n**Symmetry:**\n*   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. On the NMR timescale, this results in a time-averaged structure.\n*   Because the two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different, the molecule is strictly chiral and has no plane of symmetry.\n*   However, for the purpose of analyzing NMR spectra in introductory problems, we often assume free rotation of the ester group, which creates an \"effective\" or \"time-averaged\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. Let's proceed with this standard simplification, as analyzing the molecule as strictly chiral leads to 13 signals, which is not an option.\n*   This effective plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2-:** The two protons of this methylene group are diastereotopic. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral (due to the effective symmetry plane), the local environment is asymmetric due to proximity to the complex ring structure (C1 is a prochiral center). Replacement of one proton versus the other with a test group would create diastereomers. Therefore, these two protons are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C4 protons:** The plane of symmetry passes through the C4 atom and bisects the H-C-H angle. Protons related by a plane of symmetry are enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal** for the two C4 protons.\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 (the \"axial-like\" and \"equatorial-like\" protons) are not related by any symmetry element and are in different chemical environments (e.g., one is cis to the cyano group, the other is trans, averaged over conformations). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The protons on C6 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** Similar to the C2/C6 case, C3 and C5 are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up the distinct signals:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for CH2) = 3 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 1 (for C4-H2) + 2 (for C2/C6-H2) + 2 (for C3/C5-H2) = 5 signals\n*   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
