    "This problem requires us to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the species and calculate their moles.**\n    The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates in water to form K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates in water to form 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water.\n    *   The active buffer components are the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\n    We need to calculate the number of moles of each salt:\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles.

    "This problem asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-, in a buffer solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n\n**1. Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\n*   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n*   In water, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   In water, Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n*   The key species for the buffer are the conjugate acid-base pair: H2PO4- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base).\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of the acid and conjugate base.**\n*   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol\n*   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the initial concentrations of the acid and conjugate base.**\n*   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm3 = 200.00 mL = 0.2000 L\n*   Initial concentration of H2PO4- ([H2PO4-]_initial) = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- ([HPO4^2-]_initial) = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\nThe pH of the buffer is governed by the equilibrium involving H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n*   Equilibrium reaction: H2PO4- (aq) ⇌ H+ (aq) + HPO4^2- (aq)\n*   The equilibrium constant is Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8.\n*   The expression for Ka2 is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]. Since this is a buffer solution, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and base with their initial concentrations.\n*   [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n*   [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H+] ≈ 8.110 x 10^-8 M\n\n**5. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\nThe concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n*   Equilibrium reaction: HPO4^2- (aq) ⇌ H+ (aq) + PO4^3- (aq)\n*   The equilibrium constant is Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12.\n*   The expression for Ka3 is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]. We use the [H+] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-], as the amount that dissociates is negligible due to the very small Ka3 value.\n*   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n*   [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.110 x 10^-8 M)\n*   [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\nRounding this value to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
