As an indication, for a G2V star, S/N=10 per pixel is reached at V=19 in 1 hour in the 1-UT mode (HR). In the same conditions, S/N=10 is reached at V=16.5 in 10 minutes.\n</information>\nThe search result from the ESO website states: \"As an indication, for a G2V star, S/N=10 per pixel is reached at V=19 in 1 hour in the 1-UT mode\".\n\nThis matches the conditions of the problem. Therefore, a star is detectable if its apparent V magnitude (m_V) is less than or equal to 19, and it is visible from the Paranal Observatory.\n\n**Limiting Apparent V Magnitude (m_V) ≈ 19**\n\n**2.

    "<information>### ESPRESSO Spectrograph Achieves Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 10 on Faint Stars in One Hour\n\nThe ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a one-hour exposure on stars of approximately 16.9 magnitude in its single High-Resolution (HR) mode. This performance highlights its capability for detailed spectroscopic analysis of faint astronomical objects.\n\nA key performance indicator for a spectrograph is its ability to collect a sufficient number of photons to distinguish a signal from background noise. For the ESPRESSO instrument, it has been demonstrated that a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 per extracted pixel can be reached for a star with a visual magnitude (V) of 16.3 in a 20-minute exposure when operating in its singleHR mode. Extrapolating this to a one-hour (60-minute) exposure, the instrument can observe a fainter object while maintaining the same S/N level.\n\nThe ESPRESSO instrument offers various observing modes tailored to different scientific goals. In its High-Resolution (HR) mode, which provides a spectral resolving power of about 140,000, the limiting magnitude where the instrument transitions from being limited by photon noise to detector readout noise is considered to be around V ~ 16 mag in the HR21 binning mode and V ~ 18 mag in the HR42 binning mode. These different binning options allow for optimization depending on the target's brightness.\n\nThe instrument is a fiber-fed, cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph that can be used with a single 8.2-meter VLT Unit Telescope (UT) or with all four UTs combined, which significantly increases the light-gathering area. This flexibility, combined with its high spectral resolution and stability, makes ESPRESSO a powerful tool for a wide range of astronomical research, including the search for exoplanets and the study of fundamental physical constants. For instance, in a 30-minute observation of a quasar with a V magnitude of 17.07, ESPRESSO has demonstrated its on-sky performance capabilities. The instrument's design aims for an extreme radial-velocity precision of 10 cm/s, pushing the boundaries of astronomical observation.</information>"
