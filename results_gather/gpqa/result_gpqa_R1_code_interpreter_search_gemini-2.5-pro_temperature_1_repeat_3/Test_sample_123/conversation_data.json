    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation and exponential decay of particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe number of particles, N, remaining after a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is described by the exponential decay law:\nN(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_mean)\nwhere τ_mean is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\n**2. Account for Time Dilation**\n\nFrom our perspective in the lab (the detector's frame), the moving particles' internal clocks run slower. This means their observed lifetime is longer, a phenomenon called time dilation. The dilated lifetime (τ_lab) is related to the proper lifetime (τ_mean) by the Lorentz factor (γ):\nτ_lab = γ * τ_mean\n\nSo, in the lab frame, the decay equation becomes:\nN(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ_mean))\n\n**3. Define the Scenarios**\n\nThe time 't' in this equation is the time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the wall of the detector. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\nt = distance / speed ≈ R / c\nwhere R is the detector radius (30 m).\n\nThe fraction of particles that reach the detector wall is N(t)/N₀.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Fraction reaching the wall: N/N₀ = 1/3\n    *   Lorentz factor: γ₁ = 20\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Fraction reaching the wall: N/N₀ = 2/3\n    *   Lorentz factor: γ₂ = ?\n\n**4. Set up the Equations**\n\nLet's plug the values for each scenario into the decay equation.\n\n*   **For Scenario 1:**\n    1/3 = exp( -(R/c) / (γ₁ * τ_mean) )\n    1/3 = exp( -(R/c) / (20 * τ_mean) )\n\n*   **For Scenario 2:**\n    2/3 = exp( -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_mean) )\n\nWe have two equations and two unknowns (γ₂ and τ_mean). We can solve for γ₂.\n\n**5. Solve for γ₂**\n\nTo eliminate the exponential, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of each equation.\n\n*   **From Scenario 1:**\n    ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ_mean)\n    -ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ_mean)\n    ln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ_mean)\n    Rearranging this gives us an expression for the constant term `(R/c) / τ_mean`:\n    (R/c) / τ_mean = 20 * ln(3)\n\n*   **From Scenario 2:**\n    ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_mean)\n    -ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_mean)\n    ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_mean)\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `(R/c) / τ_mean` from the first scenario into the second one:\nln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nFinally, solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\nNow we can calculate the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma_1 = 20\nln3 = math.log(3)\nln1_5 = math.log(1.5)\n\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln3 / ln1_5\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately 54.19.\n\nThis result is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem involves the exponential decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t_lab` in the laboratory frame is given by:\n\nf = N(t_lab) / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)\n\nwhere `N₀` is the initial number of particles, `N(t_lab)` is the number of particles at time `t_lab`, and `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's proper mean lifetime (`τ_proper`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`) due to time dilation:\n\nτ_lab = γ * τ_proper\n\nThe time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance `R`) is `t_lab`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n\nt_lab ≈ R / c\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get:\n\nf = exp( -(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper) )\n\nLet's define a constant `k = (R/c) / τ_proper`. This constant depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime, which do not change between the two scenarios. The equation simplifies to:\n\nf = exp(-k / γ)\n\nWe are given two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Fraction surviving, `f₁` = 1/3\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁` = 20\n\nPlugging these values in:\n1/3 = exp(-k / 20)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction surviving, `f₂` = 2/3\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂` = ?\n\nPlugging these values in:\n2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)\n\nWe can solve for `k` using the first scenario by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -k / 20\n-ln(3) = -k / 20\nk = 20 * ln(3)\n\nNow, we use this value of `k` in the equation for the second scenario:\n2/3 = exp( -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂ )\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\nln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\nln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nFinally, we solve for `γ₂`:\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\nγ₂ = 20 * (1.0986) / (0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
