    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   Mass of the first astronaut ($m_1$): 2m\n*   Speed of the first astronaut ($v_1$): 0.6c in the positive x-direction\n*   Mass of the second astronaut ($m_2$): 3m\n*   Speed of the second astronaut ($v_2$): 0.5c in the positive x-direction\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Determine the quantities to be calculated:**\n*   The relative speed between the two astronauts ($v_{rel}$).\n*   The total energy of the system ($E_{total}$).\n\n**3. Calculate the relative speed ($v_{rel}$):**\n\nSince the speeds are relativistic, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative speed. For two objects moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$v_1 = 0.6c$\n$v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nTo compare with the options, let's convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$. This narrows down the possible answers to options B and C.\n\n**4. Calculate the total energy ($E_{total}$):**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy of a single particle moving at relativistic speed is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma mc^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):\n*   $m_1 = 2m$\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.6c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Calculate the energy $E_1$:\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\nNext, we calculate the energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):\n*   $m_2 = 3m$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.5c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n*   Calculate the energy $E_2$:\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\nNow, calculate the total energy of the system by summing the individual energies:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nTo compare with the options, we need a decimal approximation for the coefficient:\n$\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n$2\\sqrt{3} \\approx 2 \\times 1.732 = 3.464$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**5. Compare the results with the given options:**\n*   Calculated relative speed: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Calculated total energy: $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese values match option C.\n\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nB) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nC) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
