    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   The substituents are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe key to a high-yield synthesis is to introduce the groups in an order where their directing effects work together (are reinforcing) or at least do not conflict in a way that produces multiple isomers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → **Bromobenzene**.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene is treated with HNO3/H2SO4. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director. This will produce a mixture of *o*-bromonitrobenzene and *p*-bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n*   iii) The product from step ii (e.g., p-bromonitrobenzene) is treated with CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) makes the ring too electron-poor to undergo acylation. Therefore, this step would fail or give an extremely low yield. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitrobenzene**.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → **Aniline**. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   iii) Aniline is treated with CH3COCl/AlCl3. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that puts a positive charge on the nitrogen, strongly deactivating the ring and preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...**\n*   This sequence starts with:\n    *   i) Nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Reduction to aniline.\n    *   iii) Diazotization of aniline to benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   iv) Reduction of the diazonium salt with H3PO2 to remove the nitrogen group.\n*   The net result of steps i-iv is the conversion of benzene back into benzene. This sequence is nonsensical for synthesizing the target molecule. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   i) **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **Acetophenone**. This introduces the acetyl group (-COCH3). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n*   ii) **Bromination:** Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to position 3. The major product will be 3-bromoacetophenone. This creates the desired 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   iii) **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. Let's look at the directing effects of the two existing groups:\n    *   The **-COCH3** group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, so it directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The **-Br** group at position 3 is an *ortho, para*-director. It directs the incoming -NO2 group to its ortho positions (positions 2 and 4) and its para position (position 6). However, considering the combined directing effects, the position that is *ortho* to Br and *meta* to COCH3 is position 5.\n    *   Both existing groups reinforce the directing of the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This leads to a high yield of the desired single product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) listed in option D are unnecessary as the target molecule has already been formed. They appear to be distractors. However, the initial three steps constitute a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis of the target product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, only the sequence starting with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration (the first three steps of option D) provides a viable and efficient route to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
