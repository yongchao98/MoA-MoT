    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is also known as the mole fraction (α) of the species, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. Identify the Species and Equilibria**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co²⁺`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN⁻`) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free cobalt ion and all its complexes:\n\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (β):\n*   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`      ; `β₁ = [Co(SCN)]⁺ / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]`      ; `β₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²)`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻`    ; `β₃ = [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³)`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`    ; `β₄ = [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Define the Mole Fraction (α)**\n\nThe mole fraction of a specific complex, say `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`. We are interested in the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, which we'll call `α₂`:\n\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\n**4. Derive the Formula for α₂**\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of `[Co²⁺]`, `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants:\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)₂]` and `c(Co)` into the formula for `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` and the stability constants. This is convenient because we don't need to know the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` or the free cobalt concentration `[Co²⁺]` to find the *fraction* of each species.\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nThe problem states the following values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and the denominator of the `α₂` formula.\n\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Denominator**: `1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of Denominator**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**6. Convert to Percentage**\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply the mole fraction `α₂` by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# The distribution coefficient alpha for the nth species is given by:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + sum(beta_i * [L]^i for i=1 to N))\n# We are looking for alpha_2, for the [Co(SCN)2] species.\n\n# Numerator for alpha_2\nnumerator = beta2 * (SCN_conc**2)\n\n# Denominator (often called the alpha function or polynomial)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * SCN_conc**1) + (beta2 * SCN_conc**2) + (beta3 * SCN_conc**3) + (beta4 * SCN_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction (α₂) of this species and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n1.  **Identify the species:** The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n2.  **Use stability constants:** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]`, the free thiocyanate ligand `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (β):\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n3.  **Define the mole fraction (α₂):** The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species is given by:\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\n4.  **Derive the general formula:** By substituting the expressions from step 2 into the equation for c(Co), we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)₂]` and `c(Co)` into the `α₂` formula:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the formula:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the value:** We are given:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    Let's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    The denominator is the sum of these terms:\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator is the term for the desired species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n    `Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\n    Now, calculate `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n6.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%. The Python code confirms the calculation with a result of 16.916...%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
