    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons in a p-orbital. Their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    This state is an eigenstate of the total orbital angular momentum squared operator $L^2$ with eigenvalue $l(l+1)\\hbar^2 = 2(2+1)\\hbar^2 = 6\\hbar^2$, and an eigenstate of the total z-component of orbital angular momentum operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:**\n    A measurement is made on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The possible outcomes for a measurement of $L_{1z}$ are $m_1\\hbar$ where $m_1 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and similarly for $L_{2z}$, the outcomes are $m_2\\hbar$ where $m_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Target Outcome:**\n    We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the measurement outcome where the magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n4.  **Relate Coupled and Uncoupled States:**\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a superposition of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ (short for $|l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle$). The relationship is given by the Clebsch-Gordan expansion:\n    $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m> |l_1, m_1> |l_2, m_2>$\n    where $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n5.  **Apply the Conservation Rule:**\n    A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number. That is:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    The total z-component of angular momentum is conserved. The operator for the total z-component is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. When acting on the uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2>$, the eigenvalue is $(m_1 + m_2)\\hbar$. When acting on the coupled state $|l, m>$, the eigenvalue is $m\\hbar$. This implies that any state $|l, m>$ can only be a superposition of states $|m_1, m_2>$ for which $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n6.  **Apply the Rule to the Specific Problem:**\n    *   The initial state is $|1, 1, 2, -1>$. Here, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   This means the state is a superposition of uncoupled states $|1, m_1>|1, m_2>$ where the condition $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ must be satisfied. The possible pairs for $(m_1, m_2)$ are $(0, -1)$ and $(-1, 0)$.\n    *   The target measurement outcome is $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   For this target outcome, the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the state to be in the outcome $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is the squared magnitude of the corresponding coefficient in the expansion.\n    The coefficient is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$.\n    Since the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1+m_2 = -2$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the state ($m=-1$), this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    Therefore, the state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is not a component of the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    The probability of measuring this outcome is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
