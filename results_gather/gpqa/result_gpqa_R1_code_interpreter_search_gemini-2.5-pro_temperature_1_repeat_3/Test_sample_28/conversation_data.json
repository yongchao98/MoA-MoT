This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.

    "*   **Analysis of the Goal:** The objective is to find a mutation that eliminates an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective approach is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional or completely absent protein. The most severe mutations in this context are typically nonsense mutations (which create a premature stop codon) or frameshift mutations (which alter the entire downstream amino acid sequence and usually lead to a premature stop codon).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...TGA-3’\n    *   The sequence starts with `ATG`, the start codon, which codes for Methionine (Met).\n    *   The subsequent codons translate to a specific amino acid sequence:\n        *   `ATG`: Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTT`: Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `CTC`: Leucine (Leu)\n        *   `GCT`: Alanine (Ala)\n        *   ...and so on.\n    *   The protein synthesis continues until it reaches a stop codon (in this case, `TGA` at the end).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Mutants:** We will compare each mutant to the intact gene, focusing on the changes in the codons and the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n        *   Comparison with Intact:\n            *   Intact codons: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC` ...\n            *   Mutant 1 codons: `ATG` `TTC` `TAC` ...\n        *   Changes:\n            *   The second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n            *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another.\n        *   Effect: A single amino acid substitution. This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n        *   Comparison with Intact:\n            *   Intact codons: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC` ...\n            *   Mutant 2 codons: `ATG` `TTC` `TAA` ...\n        *   Changes:\n            *   The second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC` (Silent mutation, Phe -> Phe).\n            *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence (at the third codon position). Translation will terminate here, producing a tiny, non-functional dipeptide (Met-Phe). This mutation is extremely likely to completely eliminate the function of the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n        *   Comparison with Intact:\n            *   Intact codons: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT`...\n            *   Mutant 3 codons: `ATG` `TTT` `TAC` `GCT` `GGT` `GTC`...\n        *   Changes:\n            *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). A **missense mutation**.\n            *   The sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). A second **missense mutation**.\n        *   Effect: Two amino acid substitutions. While this increases the chance of disrupting the protein's function compared to Mutant 1, it is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’\n        *   Comparison with Intact:\n            *   Intact sequence: `...CTC GGT ACT...`\n            *   Mutant 4 sequence: `...TAC ACT...`\n        *   Changes: This appears to be a combination of a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one full codon (`GGT`).\n        *   Effect: This is an **in-frame deletion** (deleting 3 nucleotides), which removes one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein, in addition to the missense mutation (Leu -> Tyr). While this could significantly impact the protein structure and function, it is less certain to cause a total loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the given options, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most disruptive. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, it ensures that a functional, full-length protein cannot be produced. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
