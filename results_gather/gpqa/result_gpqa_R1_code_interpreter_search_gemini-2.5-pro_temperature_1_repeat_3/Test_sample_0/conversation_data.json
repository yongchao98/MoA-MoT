    "My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Physics Principle:** The question asks about distinguishing two energy levels (E1, E2) that have finite lifetimes (τ1, τ2). This immediately brings to mind the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime, its energy is not perfectly defined. There is an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" to the energy level.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Uncertainty Principle:** The mathematical relationship for the time-energy uncertainty principle is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which in this case is the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n    For practical calculations involving lifetimes, this is often expressed as the energy width (Γ) of the state:\n    Γ = ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Define the Condition for \"Resolving\" Energy Levels:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved,\" the difference in their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the combined spread of their energies. A conservative and common criterion is that the separation must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (Γ1 + Γ2).\n    Condition: |E1 - E2| > Γ1 + Γ2\n\n4.  **Identify Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1, τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2, τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant, ħ. The options are in electron-volts (eV), so it's most convenient to use ħ in units of eV⋅s.\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Widths (Γ1 and Γ2):**\n    *   **For state 1:** The lifetime is shorter, so we expect a larger energy width.\n        Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For state 2:** The lifetime is longer, so we expect a smaller energy width.\n        Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n6.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Separation:**\n    *   Apply the resolution condition: |E1 - E2| > Γ1 + Γ2\n    *   Sum the widths: (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   To make the addition easier, I'll put them in the same power of 10:\n        (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) = 7.2402 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   So, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is much greater than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Only option B provides an energy separation that is sufficiently large to resolve the two energy levels, as it is the only value greater than the sum of the energy widths of the states.\n\nTo be certain of the calculation and the logic, I will use a Python script to perform the computation.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the minimum energy separation required to resolve two quantum states based on their lifetimes.\n\n# Use the value of the reduced Planck constant in electron-volt-seconds.\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two quantum states in seconds.\nlifetime1 = 1e-9\nlifetime2 = 1e-8\n\n# According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the energy width (Gamma) of a state is inversely proportional to its lifetime (tau).\n# Gamma = h_bar / tau\nenergy_width1 = h_bar_eVs / lifetime1\nenergy_width2 = h_bar_eVs / lifetime2\n\n# To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.\nrequired_separation = energy_width1 + energy_width2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of the first state (τ=10^-9 s): {energy_width1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of the second state (τ=10^-8 s): {energy_width2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The minimum energy difference required to resolve them is greater than the sum of their widths: {required_separation:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Now we check the given options against this required separation.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-9,\n    \"D\": 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    is_resolvable = \"is sufficient\" if value > required_separation else \"is NOT sufficient\"\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) {is_resolvable} to resolve the levels.\")\n\n```\nEnergy width of the first state (τ=10^-9 s): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of the second state (τ=10^-8 s): 6.582e-08 eV\nThe minimum energy difference required to resolve them is greater than the sum of their widths: 7.240e-07 eV\n\nChecking the options:\nOption A (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT sufficient to resolve the levels.\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV) is sufficient to resolve the levels.\nOption C (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT sufficient to resolve the levels.\nOption D (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT sufficient to resolve the levels.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\nThe core of the problem is about the \"resolvability\" of two quantum energy levels. Each level has a finite lifetime, which, according to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, means its energy is not perfectly defined but has a certain \"width\" or uncertainty (ΔE). To distinguish or \"resolve\" two such levels, the difference in their central energies (E2 - E1) must be larger than their combined energy widths.\n\n**2. Identify the Key Physics Principle:**\nThe relevant principle is the time-energy uncertainty principle:\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\nFor this kind of problem, it's common to use the approximation for the energy width (Γ or ΔE) of a state with lifetime τ (or Δt):\nΓ = ħ / τ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**3. State the Condition for Resolution:**\nFor two energy levels E1 and E2 to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (Γ1 and Γ2).\n|E1 - E2| > Γ1 + Γ2\n\n**4. Extract Given Information:**\n*   Lifetime of state 1 (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2 (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   The options are in electron-volts (eV), so I need the value of ħ in eV⋅s.\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s\n\n**5. Perform Calculations:**\n*   **Calculate the energy width of state 1 (Γ1):**\n    Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Calculate the energy width of state 2 (Γ2):**\n    Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Calculate the minimum required energy separation:**\n    This is the sum of the widths: Γ1 + Γ2\n    Sum = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    Sum = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    Sum = 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**6. Evaluate the Options:**\nThe energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Let's check the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Too small)\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Sufficiently large)\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Too small)\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Too small)\n\n**7. Final Conclusion:**\nOnly option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation that is significantly larger than the combined energy widths of the two states, allowing them to be clearly resolved. The Python code I executed previously confirms this calculation and reasoning. The output shows that the required separation must be greater than 7.240e-07 eV, and only option B (1.0e-04 eV) satisfies this condition.\nThe final answer is therefore B. Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the underlying physical principle:** The question deals with energy levels that have finite lifetimes. This directly relates to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. This principle states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) cannot have a perfectly defined energy; there is an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE).\n\n2.  **Formulate the principle mathematically:** The time-energy uncertainty principle is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    For a state with a lifetime τ, the uncertainty in its energy, often called the energy width (Γ), is approximately:\n    Γ ≈ ħ / τ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n3.  **Define the condition for \"resolving\" the energy levels:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be clearly distinguished or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies must be larger than their combined energy widths. A common criterion for clear resolution is that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths of the two states.\n    Condition: |E1 - E2| > Γ1 + Γ2\n\n4.  **List the given values and necessary constants:**\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   The options are in electron-volts (eV), so we need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV⋅s:\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s\n\n5.  **Calculate the energy width for each state:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **State 2:**\n        Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n6.  **Calculate the minimum required energy separation:**\n    The minimum energy difference required for resolution is the sum of the two energy widths:\n    Required |E1 - E2| > Γ1 + Γ2\n    Required |E1 - E2| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    Required |E1 - E2| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    Required |E1 - E2| > 7.2402 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n7.  **Compare the required separation with the given options:**\n    We need an energy difference greater than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV  (This is smaller than the required separation)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is much larger than the required separation)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is smaller than the required separation)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is smaller than the required separation)\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Only option B provides an energy difference that is large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is the only value greater than the sum of their natural energy widths.\n\n<<<B>>>"
