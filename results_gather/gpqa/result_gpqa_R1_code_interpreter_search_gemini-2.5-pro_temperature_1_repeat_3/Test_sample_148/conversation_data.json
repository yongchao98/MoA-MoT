    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data:**\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   **Details:** The peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is 1H. This means there's one proton in total, but it exists in two different chemical environments.\n        *   **Exclusion:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting isn't due to neighboring protons.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   **Observation:** Two separate peaks are seen in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n        *   **Details:** The peaks have equal intensities and, crucially, both give the *same mass spectrum*, which matches the expected mass of the target peptide. The analysis is done at an elevated temperature.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations (The Options):**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties in both chiral and achiral environments.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers give different NMR spectra. A 1:1 mixture would show two complete sets of peaks. It's plausible that for many protons the peaks overlap, but for a specific proton (like the alpha-proton mentioned), two distinct signals could be resolved. This fits the observation.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC. This explains the two peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass, which explains why the mass spectra are identical. This also fits the observation perfectly.\n        *   **A common example in peptides:** A very common source of diastereomers in peptides is *cis-trans* isomerism around the amide bond, particularly for bonds involving a proline residue. These isomers (often called rotamers) interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale at room temperature, giving rise to two sets of signals. They are also separable by LC. The \"elevated temperature\" in the LC-MS might be relevant to the rate of this interconversion. This scenario is a specific type of diastereomerism.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   **Definition:** This implies a side reaction that changes the chemical structure, for example, by adding an extra amino acid or forming a branched structure.\n        *   **Consistency:** Such a reaction would create a new molecule with a different chemical formula and therefore a *different mass*. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the expected product. This option is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   **Definition:** A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate from an earlier step in the synthesis.\n        *   **Consistency:** Like the side product in option B, a precursor would have a different chemical structure and a *different mass* from the final product. This option is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are chemically identical and indistinguishable. They would give a single, identical NMR spectrum. You would not see two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties (except for their interaction with plane-polarized light) and cannot be separated by standard LC. A special chiral column would be required.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and the LC data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    The only explanation that accounts for all the observations—two species that are distinguishable by both NMR and LC but have the identical mass—is that they are diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
