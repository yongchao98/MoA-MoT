    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ):\n\nλ ∝ 1 / (n * σ)\n\n*   **n:** The number of target particles per unit volume. In this scenario, the gas pressure and temperature are constant, so the number density 'n' of residual gas molecules is the same for both cases.\n*   **σ:** The collision cross-section. This represents the effective \"size\" of the target for a collision to occur. This is the key parameter that differs between the two situations.\n\n**2. Analyze λ1: Gas Molecule MFP**\n\n*   λ1 is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   In this case, both the projectile molecule and the target molecules are moving with thermal velocities. This movement of the targets increases the probability of collision compared to a situation with stationary targets.\n*   Kinetic theory accounts for this with a factor of √2 (approximately 1.414).\n*   The formula is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   where σ_gg is the gas-kinetic cross-section (i.e., the effective area of one gas molecule for collision with another).\n\n**3. Analyze λ2: Electron MFP**\n\n*   λ2 is the mean free path of a high-energy electron (from the 1000 kV beam) colliding with a gas molecule.\n*   In this case, the projectile is a very fast electron (moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light), and the targets are the relatively slow-moving (quasi-stationary) gas molecules.\n*   Because the targets are effectively stationary compared to the electron's high speed, the √2 factor is not present in the formula.\n*   The formula is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   where σ_eg is the scattering cross-section of a gas molecule for a high-energy electron.\n\n**4. Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the reasoning.\n*   **σ_gg:** This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the electron shells of the gas molecule. It's the cross-section for a \"hard-sphere\" like collision between two molecules.\n*   **σ_eg:** This is the scattering cross-section for a 1000 keV (1 MeV) electron. A high-energy electron is a point-like particle that is highly penetrating. It interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. For such a high energy, the electron can often pass straight through the diffuse electron cloud of a light gas molecule (like N₂, O₂, H₂O) without a significant interaction (i.e., without being scattered out of the beam). The probability of a collision is much lower.\n*   Therefore, the effective area for collision as seen by the high-energy electron is significantly *smaller* than the physical cross-section between two gas molecules.\n*   Conclusion: **σ_eg < σ_gg**\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of λ2 to λ1**\n\nNow we can find the relationship between λ2 and λ1 by taking their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**6. Draw the Final Conclusion**\n\n*   We know √2 ≈ 1.414.\n*   Since we established that σ_eg < σ_gg, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is greater than 1.\n*   Therefore, the total ratio λ2 / λ1 must be greater than √2.\n*   **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**\n\n**7. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This contradicts λ2 > 1.414 * λ1.\n*   B) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The physics of the two collision types are different.\n*   C) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This would imply the electron has a larger collision cross-section, which is physically wrong for a high-energy electron.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. If λ2 is greater than 1.414 * λ1, it is certainly greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ1. This is the only option consistent with the physical reasoning.\n\n<<<D>>>"
