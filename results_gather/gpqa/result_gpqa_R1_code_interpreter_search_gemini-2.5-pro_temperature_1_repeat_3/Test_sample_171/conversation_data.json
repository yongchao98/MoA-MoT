    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves the population of atomic energy levels in stars under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The physical law that describes this is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy states (say, an excited state `b` and a ground state `a`) to the temperature `T`:\n    `N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in the excited and ground states, respectively.\n    *   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the states (`E_b - E_a`).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to each star:** We are comparing the same energy transition in two different stars, so `ΔE`, `g_b`, and `g_a` are the same for both.\n\n    *   For star_1 (temperature `T_1`):\n        The ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms is:\n        `(N_excited / N_ground)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\n    *   For star_2 (temperature `T_2`):\n        The ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms is:\n        `(N_excited / N_ground)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Incorporate the given information:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n    `(N_excited / N_ground)_1 = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)_2`\n\n5.  **Set up the equation:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 4.\n    `(g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The statistical weight term `(g_b / g_a)` is common on both sides and cancels out.\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n7.  **Isolate the exponential terms:**\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2`\n    Using the property of exponents `e^x / e^y = e^(x-y)`:\n    `exp( (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ) = 2`\n    `exp( ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) ) = 2`\n    `exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ) = 2`\n\n8.  **Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n    `ln[ exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ) ] = ln(2)`\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n9.  **Substitute the given values:**\n    The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k` is a fundamental constant with the value `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n\n    Substitute this value back into the equation:\n    `1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n10. **Perform the final algebraic manipulation:**\n    `1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = ln(2)`\n    Combine the fractions on the left side by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n    `(T_1 / (T_1 * T_2)) - (T_2 / (T_1 * T_2)) = ln(2)`\n    `(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) = ln(2)`\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:** The derived equation `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
