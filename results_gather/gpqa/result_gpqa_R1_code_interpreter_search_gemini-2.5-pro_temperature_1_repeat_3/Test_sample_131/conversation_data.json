    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The mixture contains two different compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: There are two protons at C4 and C6. These are in different chemical environments (H4 is between two methyls, H6 is between a methyl and a hydrogen). They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other. Therefore, they will couple and appear as a **multiplet** (specifically, an AB quartet or a pair of doublets), not a singlet. This is a key point.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). This would give two singlets of 6H each.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: Highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one **singlet** for **4H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The signals will be a **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups). These are not singlets.\n\n**3. Use a Process of Elimination based on the Spectral Data**\n\nWe can now eliminate options based on the characteristics of the mixture's spectrum.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states that the aliphatic signals are \"all singlets\". **1,4-diethylbenzene** produces a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene is incorrect.\n    *   This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aromatic Signals:** The problem states that the aromatic signals are \"two singlets\". **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** has two adjacent aromatic protons, which would result in a multiplet, not a singlet. Therefore, any option containing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is incorrect.\n    *   This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**.\n\n**4. Confirm the Remaining Option**\n\nThe only remaining option is **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds can produce the described spectrum.\n\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides two singlets, each for 1H.\n    *   The problem states the mixture has \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\". In a 1:1 mixture of these two isomers, the total number of aromatic protons is 2 + 2 = 4H. A 1:1 ratio means each signal must integrate to 2H. This can happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are \"accidentally isochronous\" (have the same chemical shift), thus appearing as a single 2H singlet. The mixture would then show two 2H singlets (one from each compound), which perfectly matches the 1:1 ratio description.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   The problem states there are \"three signals ... in a 2:1:1 ratio\". This perfectly describes the spectrum of pure **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** (6H:3H:3H ratio).\n    *   What about the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB? For the final spectrum of the mixture to have three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, there must be a coincidental overlap of signals.\n    *   Let's check the total integration. Total aliphatic protons = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   Let's see if we can form this from the components:\n        *   Signal 1 (12H): This comes directly from the 12H singlet of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   Signal 2 (6H): This comes from the 6H singlet of 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n        *   Signal 3 (6H): This must be formed by the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB being accidentally isochronous and overlapping.\n    *   This explanation, while requiring two separate instances of accidental signal overlap, is the only one that logically fits all the data provided. Such simplifications are common in spectroscopy problems.\n\nThe process of elimination is the most straightforward path to the solution. The compounds that do not produce singlets in the specified regions can be immediately ruled out, leaving only one possible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
