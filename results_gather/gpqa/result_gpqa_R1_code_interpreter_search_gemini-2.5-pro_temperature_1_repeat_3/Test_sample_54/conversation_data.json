    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Proton Count (Integration):**\n    First, let's determine the total number of protons in the molecule from the integration values given in the 1H NMR data.\n    *   Signal 1: 1H\n    *   Signal 2: 1H\n    *   Signal 3: 3H\n    *   Signal 4: 3H\n    *   **Total Protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8H**\n\n2.  **Compare Proton Count with Possible Structures:**\n    Now, let's find the number of protons in each of the proposed compounds.\n    *   **Propenyl acetate:** The propenyl group is C3H5, and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The formula is C5H8O2. It has **8 protons**. This matches our data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate:** The butenyl group is C4H7, and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The formula is C6H10O2. It has **10 protons**. This does not match our data.\n\n    Based on the total number of protons, we can confidently eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate (B)** and **Trans-butenyl acetate (A)**. The correct compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Coupling Constant (J-value) to Determine Stereochemistry:**\n    We are left with two options: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing between them is the coupling constant (J) between the two protons on the double bond (vinylic protons).\n    *   The data shows a signal at **7.0 ppm** which is a doublet (**d**) with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the magnitude of the coupling constant between vinylic protons is highly dependent on their geometric relationship:\n        *   **Trans-protons:** J-values are typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis-protons:** J-values are smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration. This indicates that the two protons on the double bond are on opposite sides.\n\n    This evidence allows us to eliminate **Cis-propenyl acetate (D)**.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n    Let's assign all the signals to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate to ensure a perfect match.\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n          H(b)   H(a)\n           \\    /\n        CH3(c)-C==C--O--C(=O)--CH3(d)\n        ```\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This is the singlet for the three equivalent protons of the acetate methyl group (**CH3(d)**). It's a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon. This matches.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the vinylic proton **H(a)**. It is shifted far downfield because it is attached to a carbon that is bonded to a deshielding oxygen atom. It is split into a doublet by its trans-neighbor, **H(b)**. This matches perfectly.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton, **H(b)**. It is split into a doublet by **H(a)** (with the same J=16.0 Hz coupling) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group **CH3(c)**. This results in a doublet of quartets (dq). This matches.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is the methyl group on the double bond, **CH3(c)**. It is split into a doublet by the single adjacent proton, **H(b)**. This matches.\n\nAll aspects of the 1H NMR data are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
