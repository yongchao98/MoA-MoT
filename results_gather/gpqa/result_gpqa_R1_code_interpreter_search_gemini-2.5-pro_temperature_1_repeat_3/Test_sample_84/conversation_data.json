    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 ($T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left(\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}\\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    Where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1})^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2})^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$).\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observations:** The semi-major axis can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum radial velocity of the star induced by a planet, known as the RV semi-amplitude (K), is given by the Doppler shift formula:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n    Where $c$ is the speed of light, $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the maximum wavelength shift, and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, K is also related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), the orbital semi-major axis ($a$), and the orbital inclination ($i$):\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{G}{a}\\right)^{1/2} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n    (assuming $M_p \\ll M_{star}$).\n    Since both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbital inclination must be close to 90°, so we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n    Now, we can compute the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p,2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / (K_2^2 M_{star})}{G M_{p,1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / (K_1^2 M_{star})}$\n    The terms $G$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin^2(i)$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{M_{p,1}^2} \\times \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratios of Mass and RV Semi-Amplitude:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:**\n        $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:** The semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\ \\text{Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Ratios:**\n    *   **Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** Substitute the calculated ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** Now use this value to find the temperature ratio:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Performing the final division to get a decimal value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes\na2_over_a1 = (5/7)**2 * (0.03/0.04)**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\nT_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(T_ratio)\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> 0.5357142857142857\n\nThe result is approximately 0.536. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can set up the ratio for the two planets:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It is also given that the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). These terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$).\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_{star}$), the formula is:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} \\right)^{1/2} M_p \\sin(i)$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    Since both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on, meaning their inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p,2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2)}{K_2^2 M_{star}}}{\\frac{G M_{p,1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1)}{K_1^2 M_{star}}}$\n    The terms $G$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin^2(i)$ (since $i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90^\\circ$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p,1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Determine the Input Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** $M_{p,1} = 7 \\ M_{Earth}$, $M_{p,2} = 5 \\ M_{Earth}$.\n        $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:** The Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K.\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n9.  **Substitute and Calculate:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of semi-major axes:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n    *   Now, calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n10. **Final Answer:** Convert the fraction to a decimal.\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
