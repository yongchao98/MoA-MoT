    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the acidic α-carbon (the CH₂ group flanked by two ester groups), forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic site for Michael addition is the β-carbon. The carbonyl carbon is C=O, the adjacent carbon is α, and the next one is β. So, the structure is `p-tolyl-CβH=CαH-COOCH₃`.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons from the C=C bond shift to form an enolate intermediate, which is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent.\n    *   **Attack:** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon.\n    *   **Intermediate Formation & Protonation:** `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃` is formed, which is quickly protonated by EtOH to give `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n4.  **Name the Product (A):** The product structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this using the options' systematic nomenclature, we can consider it a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid, which has the backbone `(HOOC)₂CH-CH₂-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   Our product has a `p-tolyl` group substituting a hydrogen on the central carbon (C2).\n    *   So, the parent acid is 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   The final product is the trimethyl ester of this acid.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is part of the Stork enamine synthesis.\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic β-carbon is the one attached to the methyl group: `CH₃-CβH=CαH-CN`.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) first protonates the intermediate anion and then hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n    *   **Attack & Intermediate:** The enamine attacks the nitrile, forming a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The `H₃O⁺` workup converts the enamine functionality back to a carbonyl group.\n4.  **Identify the Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the C2 position (α to the carbonyl). The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile acceptor: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The full structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   Naming this compound as a substituted butanenitrile: The main chain is the four-carbon nitrile. There is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group attached to carbon 3 of the nitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Acceptor (Retro-Michael Reaction):** This is a retrosynthesis problem. We need to identify reactant C.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`. The β-carbon is the `CH₂` group.\n2.  **Identify the Bond Formed:** The Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. In the product, the `(3-oxobutyl)` group, `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`, comes from MVK. The bond must have formed at the terminal `CH₂` of this group.\n3.  **Identify the Michael Donor (C):** The rest of the molecule must have been the nucleophile (Michael donor). This is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety, connected at C2.\n    *   Cyclohexane-1,3-dione has highly acidic protons on the C2 carbon, as this carbon is located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The base, KOH, will deprotonate C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form a stable enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as the nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
