As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the single-mutant phenotypes:**\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 (G1 knock-out):** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 causes a partial loss of resistance (25% reduction). This means G1 contributes to resistance, but is not absolutely essential on its own.\n*   **g2 (G2 knock-out):** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 (G3 knock-out):** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 causes a significant loss of resistance (50% reduction), more than G1. G3 is important but also not solely essential if G1 is present.\n\n**2. Identify the Transcription Factor and Epistasis:**\n*   The problem states that one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of the others. An upstream gene in a pathway often exhibits epistasis over downstream genes. Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of one gene mutation masks the phenotype of another.\n*   Let's examine the double mutants involving `g2`:\n    *   **g1g2:** 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. The effect of the `g1` mutation (which would normally result in 75% resistance) is completely masked by the `g2` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   **g2g3:** 0% resistance. This is also the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. The effect of the `g3` mutation (which would normally result in 50% resistance) is masked by the `g2` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n*   Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it must act upstream of them in the resistance pathway. Given its essential role (0% resistance in the single mutant) and its position upstream, **G2 is the transcription factor** that likely activates the expression of G1 and G3.\n\n**3. Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3:**\n*   Now let's look at the `g1g3` double mutant.\n    *   `g1` resistance = 75% (a loss of 25%)\n    *   `g3` resistance = 50% (a loss of 50%)\n    *   `g1g3` resistance = 10% (a loss of 90%)\n*   If the genes acted independently (additively), the expected loss in the double mutant would be the sum of the individual losses: 25% + 50% = 75%. This would leave 25% resistance.\n*   However, the observed resistance is only 10% (a 90% loss). The actual effect is much more severe than the simple sum of the parts. This is a classic example of a **synergistic genetic interaction**.\n*   Synergistic interactions often indicate that the two genes (G1 and G3) have partially overlapping or compensatory functions. They work in parallel to contribute to resistance. When one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate, but when both are knocked out, the function is almost completely lost. This relationship is described as **gene redundancy** (or partial redundancy).\n*   We can also check for epistasis between G1 and G3. For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would have to be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%), which it is not. For G3 to be epistatic to G1, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would have to be the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%), which it is not. Therefore, there is no epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options:**\nBased on our analysis, the key conclusions are:\n*   G2 is the transcription factor.\n*   G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.\n*   G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (synergistic interaction).\n\nLet's check the given options against these conclusions:\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   Incorrect. G2 is the transcription factor, not G1. We also cannot conclude anything about pleiotropy.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   Incorrect. G3 is not epistatic towards G1.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   This option correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The third part, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\", is incorrect based on a strict definition. However, the first two statements are the most accurate and important conclusions from the experiment.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   Incorrect. We cannot conclude pleiotropy, and G1 is not epistatic towards G3.\n\nComparing the options, Option C contains two correct and central conclusions drawn directly from the data, while the other options contain at most one correct conclusion and other incorrect or unsupported claims. Despite the error in its third clause, Option C is the best and most comprehensive description of the genetic interactions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
