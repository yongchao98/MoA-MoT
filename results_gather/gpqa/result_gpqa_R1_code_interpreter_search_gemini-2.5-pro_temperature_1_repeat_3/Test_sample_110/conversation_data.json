    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This will act as the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then act as a nucleophile and attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-protons.\n    *   **C6:** is substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms a single, specific enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The β-carbon is the CH₂ group of CH₂=CHCOOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an ester enolate, which is then protonated during the workup step to give the final product, A.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The new substituent attached to C6 of the cyclohexanone ring is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   To name the product, we can treat the propanoate as the parent chain, as done in the options.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We must now name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is designated as position 1 of the substituent.\n        *   **Position 1 (old C6):** Point of attachment, has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **Position 2 (old C1):** Has the carbonyl group (**oxo**).\n        *   **Position 3 (old C2):** Has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Putting it together, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-protons are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. This is the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   This reaction is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group).\n    *   This forms a nitronate anion: CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group (CH₃-**CH**=CHCN).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the original nitropropane and the β-carbon of the original butenenitrile.\n    *   The intermediate carbanion (at the α-position to the nitrile) is protonated by water to give the final product, B.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is: CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now we number the chain and identify the substituents:\n        *   **C1:** -CN\n        *   **C2:** -CH₂-\n        *   **C3:** -CH(CH₃)- (a **methyl** group is at C3)\n        *   **C4:** -CH(NO₂)- (a **nitro** group is at C4)\n        *   **C5:** -CH₂-\n        *   **C6:** -CH₃\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nOnly option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
