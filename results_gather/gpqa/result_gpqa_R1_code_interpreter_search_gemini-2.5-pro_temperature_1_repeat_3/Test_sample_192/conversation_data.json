    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) per unit range of parallax (`plx`) varies as `1/plx^5`. This can be written mathematically as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`r`) changes with distance. In other words, we need to find the proportionality for `dN/dr` in terms of `r`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. The standard astronomical definition is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    To convert the derivative with respect to parallax (`d/d(plx)`) to a derivative with respect to distance (`d/dr`), we use the chain rule:\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    Since the number of stars in a given range must be a positive quantity, we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship. So, we can consider `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now, substitute the known proportionalities and the derivative back into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ dN/d(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (`r`):**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. We need to replace `plx` with its equivalent in `r` using the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n8.  **Final Proportionality:**\n    Substitute this back into the expression for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes as `r³`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
