    "This question asks for the major product of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Br₂).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:**\n    *   **4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol:** This is a five-membered ring (\"cyclopent\"). The \"-en-\" and \"-ol\" suffixes indicate the presence of both a double bond (alkene) and a hydroxyl group (alcohol). The \"1\" specifies that both functional groups originate from carbon 1. This means there is a double bond between C1 and C2, and an -OH group is attached to C1. This specific arrangement (C=C-OH) is known as an enol. The \"4,4-dimethyl\" indicates two methyl groups are attached to carbon 4 of the ring.\n    *   **Bromine (Br₂):** This is a diatomic halogen molecule. In the context of organic chemistry, it often acts as an electrophile, particularly in reactions with electron-rich species like alkenes or enols.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    The reaction is between an enol and bromine. Enols are electron-rich due to the pi electrons of the double bond and the lone pairs on the oxygen atom. They can act as nucleophiles. Br₂ will act as the electrophile. This will be an electrophilic addition/substitution type of reaction.\n\n3.  **Consider the Reactivity of Enols:**\n    Enols are generally unstable intermediates that exist in equilibrium with their more stable carbonyl tautomers (ketones or aldehydes). This is called keto-enol tautomerism. In this case, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol is the enol tautomer of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\n    However, the question provides the enol as the starting material and asks for its direct reaction with bromine. The reaction of an enol with a halogen like Br₂ is a key step in the acid-catalyzed α-halogenation of ketones. This reaction is known to be very fast.\n\n4.  **Propose a Mechanism:**\n    The electron-rich double bond of the enol will attack the bromine molecule, which is the electrophile.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Nucleophilic Attack.** The pi electrons from the C1=C2 double bond attack one of the bromine atoms in the Br₂ molecule. The Br-Br bond breaks, and the other bromine atom leaves as a bromide ion (Br⁻).\n    *   **Step 2: Intermediate Formation.** The electrophilic bromine atom (Br⁺) will add to the carbon atom that results in the most stable intermediate.\n        *   **Possibility A:** If Br⁺ adds to C1, a carbocation forms at C2. This is a secondary carbocation.\n        *   **Possibility B:** If Br⁺ adds to C2, a carbocation forms at C1. This carbocation is adjacent to the hydroxyl group. The lone pairs on the oxygen atom can stabilize this positive charge through resonance, forming an oxocarbenium ion ([C=O⁺-H]). This resonance stabilization makes the carbocation at C1 significantly more stable than the one at C2.\n        *   Therefore, the reaction proceeds via pathway B, with bromine adding to C2.\n    *   **Step 3: Deprotonation.** The resulting intermediate is an oxocarbenium ion, which is essentially a protonated α-bromo ketone. A weak base in the mixture (such as the Br⁻ ion formed in Step 1 or the solvent) will remove the acidic proton from the oxygen atom.\n    *   **Step 4: Final Product.** The removal of the proton neutralizes the oxygen atom and forms a carbonyl group (C=O) at C1.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of the Final Product:**\n    *   The starting ring structure with the 4,4-dimethyl groups remains intact.\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is formed at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom is attached to position 2.\n    *   The resulting molecule is **2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Incorrect. Bromination occurs at the α-carbon (C2 or C5), not at C4.\n    *   B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Correct. This matches the product derived from our mechanistic analysis.\n    *   C) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: Incorrect. This would be the product of an addition reaction where both bromine atoms add across the double bond, and the -OH group remains. The formation of the highly stable carbonyl group is the major driving force, leading to substitution rather than simple addition.\n    *   D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: Incorrect, for the same reason as C.\n\nThe reaction of an enol with bromine results in an α-halo ketone. Therefore, the major outcome is the formation of 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
