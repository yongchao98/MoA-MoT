    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the atoms and bonds. The chemical formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: This part has 1 central carbon atom, plus 2 methyl (CH3) groups. Total C = 1 + 2 = 3. Total H = 2 * 3 = 6.\n*   `=CH-`: 1 C atom and 1 H atom.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C atom and 2 H atoms.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C atom and 1 H atom in the main chain, plus one methyl (CH3) group. Total C = 1 + 1 = 2. Total H = 1 + 3 = 4.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C atom and 2 H atoms.\n*   `-CH=`: 1 C atom and 1 H atom.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 central carbon atom, plus 2 methyl (CH3) groups. Total C = 1 + 2 = 3. Total H = 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nLet's sum them up:\n*   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNow, we count the number of C-C single bonds, C=C double bonds, and C-H single bonds.\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, and each is bonded to a carbon atom. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The formula clearly shows two double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: We can count these from the structure or use the valency rule. Let's use the valency rule for accuracy.\n    *   The sum of valencies for all atoms is (12 C * 4) + (22 H * 1) = 48 + 22 = 70.\n    *   The sum of valencies must equal twice the sum of all bonds, where a double bond counts as two bonds.\n    *   Sum of valencies = 2 * (No. of C-C) + 2 * (No. of C=C) * 2 + (No. of C-H)\n    *   70 = 2 * N(C-C) + 2 * 2 * 2 + 22\n    *   70 = 2 * N(C-C) + 8 + 22\n    *   70 = 2 * N(C-C) + 30\n    *   40 = 2 * N(C-C)\n    *   N(C-C) = 20.  Wait, this is wrong. Let me re-check the formula.\n\nLet's use the other valency method:\nSum of valencies of carbon atoms = N(C-H) + 2 * N(C-C) + 2 * 2 * N(C=C)\n12 * 4 = 22 + 2 * N(C-C) + 4 * 2\n48 = 22 + 2 * N(C-C) + 8\n48 = 30 + 2 * N(C-C)\n18 = 2 * N(C-C)\nN(C-C) = **9 C-C bonds**. This is the correct method.\n\nSo, we have:\n*   9 C-C bonds\n*   2 C=C bonds\n*   22 C-H bonds\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous molecule. It's the sum of all bond energies.\nΔH_atom(compound) = [9 * BE(C-C)] + [2 * BE(C=C)] + [22 * BE(C-H)]\nΔH_atom(compound) = [9 * 200] + [2 * 300] + [22 * 400]\nΔH_atom(compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)).\nReaction: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\nΔH_atom(elements) = [12 * ΔH_atom(C)] + [11 * BE(H-H)]\nΔH_atom(elements) = [12 * 1000] + [11 * 100]\nΔH_atom(elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when forming the molecule from its gaseous atoms (which is equal to the total bond energy).\nΔHf = ΔH_atom(elements) - ΔH_atom(compound)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Check the Options and Units**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\nB) 1900 kJ/g (Incorrect units)\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect value)\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Option D is in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check if it matches.\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.0) + (22 * 1.0) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   ΔHf (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) = 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the arithmetic.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem (in kJ/mol)\nenthalpy_atom_C = 1000\nBE_H_H = 100\nBE_C_C = 200\nBE_C_eq_C = 300  # C=C bond energy\nBE_C_H = 400\n\n# Number of atoms in the molecule C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds in the molecule\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_eq_C_bonds = 2\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the molecule (enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\n# This is the energy required for the process: C12H22(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\nenthalpy_atom_compound = (num_C_C_bonds * BE_C_C) + (num_C_eq_C_bonds * BE_C_eq_C) + (num_C_H_bonds * BE_C_H)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements in their standard state\n# This is the energy required for the process: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\nnum_H2_molecules = num_H / 2\nenthalpy_atom_elements = (num_C * enthalpy_atom_C) + (num_H2_molecules * BE_H_H)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf)\n# ΔHf = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\nenthalpy_of_formation_per_mol = enthalpy_atom_elements - enthalpy_atom_compound\n\n# Step 6: Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (using C=12, H=1 for simplicity as is common in these problems)\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\nenthalpy_of_formation_per_gram = enthalpy_of_formation_per_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_of_formation_per_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_of_formation_per_gram}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n```python\n# Given values from the problem (in kJ/mol)\nenthalpy_atom_C = 1000\nBE_H_H = 100\nBE_C_C = 200\nBE_C_eq_C = 300  # C=C bond energy\nBE_C_H = 400\n\n# Number of atoms in the molecule C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds in the molecule\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_eq_C_bonds = 2\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the molecule (enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\n# This is the energy required for the process: C12H22(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\nenthalpy_atom_compound = (num_C_C_bonds * BE_C_C) + (num_C_eq_C_bonds * BE_C_eq_C) + (num_C_H_bonds * BE_C_H)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements in their standard state\n# This is the energy required for the process: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\nnum_H2_molecules = num_H / 2\nenthalpy_atom_elements = (num_C * enthalpy_atom_C) + (num_H2_molecules * BE_H_H)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf)\n# ΔHf = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\nenthalpy_of_formation_per_mol = enthalpy_atom_elements - enthalpy_atom_compound\n\n# Step 6: Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (using C=12, H=1 for simplicity as is common in these problems)\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\nenthalpy_of_formation_per_gram = enthalpy_of_formation_per_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_of_formation_per_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_of_formation_per_gram}\")\n```\n</execute_code>\n[execution_results]\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n[end of execution_results]\nThe calculation confirms that the enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol, which corresponds to 11.446 kJ/g.
