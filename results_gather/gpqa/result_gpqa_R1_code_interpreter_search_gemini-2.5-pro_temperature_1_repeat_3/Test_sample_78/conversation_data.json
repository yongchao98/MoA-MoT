    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction and Product from the Provided NMR Data**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (C11H12O) is treated with DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base) at high temperature (403 K = 130 °C). This suggests a base-catalyzed rearrangement or elimination reaction. Since the molecular formula doesn't change, it's a rearrangement. The starting material options are all epoxides adjacent to a double bond (vinyloxiranes), and this type of reaction is a known base-catalyzed rearrangement of vinyloxiranes to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.\n\n*   **Product's 13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is highly characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n    *   The absence of a proton signal around δ 9-10 ppm in the 1H NMR indicates this carbonyl is a **ketone**, not an aldehyde.\n    *   There are 8 signals in the alkene/aromatic region (δ 120-150 ppm), indicating a conjugated system.\n    *   Signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** correspond to two different aliphatic carbons, which, based on the 1H NMR, are methyl groups.\n\n*   **Product's 1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: These are two non-equivalent methyl groups that are singlets, meaning they have no adjacent protons. One is likely a methyl ketone (-COCH3) and the other an aryl-methyl group (e.g., on a tolyl group).\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: This pattern is classic for a **para-substituted benzene ring**. The large chemical shift difference suggests the two substituents have very different electronic properties (one donating, one strongly withdrawing).\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: These are two non-equivalent vinyl protons on a double bond (-CH=CH-). They are doublets because they are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a ketone.\n    2.  We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    3.  We have two methyl groups, one of which is likely on the ring (making it a tolyl group) and the other is part of the ketone (an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n    4.  We have a -CH=CH- group.\n    5.  Let's assemble these pieces: A para-tolyl group (p-Me-C6H4-), a trans-alkene (-CH=CH-), and a methyl ketone group (-C(=O)CH3).\n    6.  The most logical structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one** (also known as p-methylbenzalacetone).\n        *   Structure: p-Me-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3\n        *   Formula: C11H12O. This matches.\n        *   Let's verify the NMR assignment for this structure:\n            *   p-Me-C6H4-: This accounts for one methyl singlet (~2.3-2.4 ppm) and the para-substituted aromatic pattern. The substituent -CH=CH-CO-CH3 is strongly electron-withdrawing, which would shift the ortho protons (δ ~7.71 ppm) significantly downfield compared to the meta protons (δ ~7.08 ppm). This matches the data.\n            *   -C(=O)CH3: This accounts for the second methyl singlet (~2.2-2.3 ppm). This matches.\n            *   -CH=CH-: This accounts for the two vinyl doublets. The proton α to the carbonyl (Hα) would be upfield (δ ~6.75 ppm) compared to the proton β to the carbonyl (Hβ), which is deshielded by the ring (δ ~7.68 ppm). This matches.\n    *   Conclusion: The product of the reaction is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**2. Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nNow we need to determine which of the options for Compound X would rearrange to form this specific product. The reaction is the base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyloxirane. The mechanism, as confirmed by a literature search, is as follows:\nR-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2 → R-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3\n\nThis means a terminal vinyloxirane (an epoxide ring at the end of a vinyl group) rearranges to a methyl ketone.\n\n*   Our product is: p-Me-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3\n*   This means the \"R\" group is the para-tolyl group (p-Me-C6H4-).\n*   Following the mechanism, the starting material (Compound X) must be **p-Me-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH3):** Would rearrange to 1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one. Product has an ethyl ketone and a phenyl group, not a methyl ketone and a tolyl group. Incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The 4-methylstyryl group is p-Me-C6H4-CH=CH-. The oxirane is attached at the end, so the structure is p-Me-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2. This is exactly the structure we deduced is required to form the observed product. Its formula is C11H12O. This is the correct answer.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide (Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2):** The molecular formula is C10H10O, which does not match the given formula for X (C11H12O). Incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane (Ph-CH=C(CH3)-CH(O)CH2):** Would rearrange to 3-methyl-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one. The product would have a simple phenyl group (not p-tolyl) and a single vinylic proton (a singlet), which contradicts the NMR data. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
