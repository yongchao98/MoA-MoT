    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Initial Parameters and Calculate Fragment Masses\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Let the rest masses of the two fragments be `m1` and `m2`. `m1` is the more massive fragment.\n*   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments (`E1 = m1*c^2` and `E2 = m2*c^2`):\nFrom `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`, so `E1 = 2 * E2`.\nFrom `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, we have `(m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`, so `E1 + E2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow we solve the system of equations:\n`E1 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n`E1 = 2 * E2`\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first:\n`2 * E2 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * E2 = 297 GeV`\n`E2 = 99 GeV`\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\n`E1 = 2 * E2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released\n\nThe total energy is conserved.\n*   Initial total energy = `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Final total energy = `(m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`, where `T1` and `T2` are the kinetic energies of the fragments.\n\n`M*c^2 = m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 + T1 + T2`\n`300 GeV = (198 GeV + 99 GeV) + (T1 + T2)`\n`300 GeV = 297 GeV + T_total`\n`T_total = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, momentum `p = mv` and kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\nTherefore, `p1^2 = p2^2`.\nUsing the classical formula for kinetic energy:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`\n\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\nSo, `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Formulas (Correct Value)\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy `T` is given by `T = E - m*c^2`.\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation, we can express momentum in terms of kinetic energy:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\n\nAgain, from conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\nLet `T1_rel` and `T2_rel` be the relativistic kinetic energies.\n`T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (m1*c^2) = T2_rel^2 + 2 * T2_rel * (m2*c^2)`\n\nWe substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2_rel = 3 GeV - T1_rel`.\n\n`T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (198) = (3 - T1_rel)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1_rel) * (99)`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396 * T1_rel = (9 - 6*T1_rel + T1_rel^2) + (594 - 198*T1_rel)`\n\nThe `T1_rel^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396 * T1_rel = 9 - 6*T1_rel + 594 - 198*T1_rel`\n`396 * T1_rel = 603 - 204*T1_rel`\n`396 * T1_rel + 204*T1_rel = 603`\n`600 * T1_rel = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Difference\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV:\n`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants from the problem in GeV\nE_M = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy\n\n# Calculate fragment rest-mass energies\n# E1 + E2 = 0.99 * E_M\n# E1 = 2 * E2\nE1_plus_E2 = 0.99 * E_M\n# 3 * E2 = E1_plus_E2\nE2 = E1_plus_E2 / 3.0\nE1 = 2.0 * E2\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy\nT_total = E_M - E1_plus_E2\n\n# 1. Classical Calculation\n# T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = E2 / E1 = 1/2 => T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = T_total\n# T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = T_total => 3*T1_cl = T_total\nT1_classical = T_total / 3.0\n\n# 2. Relativistic Calculation\n# (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)\n# T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*E1 = T2_rel^2 + 2*T2_rel*E2\n# T2_rel = T_total - T1_rel\n# T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*E1 = (T_total - T1_rel)^2 + 2*(T_total - T1_rel)*E2\n# T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*E1 = T_total^2 - 2*T_total*T1_rel + T1_rel^2 + 2*T_total*E2 - 2*T1_rel*E2\n# 2*T1_rel*E1 = T_total^2 - 2*T_total*T1_rel + 2*T_total*E2 - 2*T1_rel*E2\n# T1_rel * (2*E1 + 2*T_total + 2*E2) = T_total^2 + 2*T_total*E2\n# T1_rel * 2 * (E1 + E2 + T_total) = T_total * (T_total + 2*E2)\n# T1_rel * 2 * E_M = T_total * (T_total + 2*E2)\nT1_relativistic = (T_total * (T_total + 2 * E2)) / (2 * E_M)\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_gev = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_mev = difference_gev * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_mev:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n\nThe calculation is confirmed.

    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV` and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\nWe are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's denote the more massive fragment by `m1`.\n`m1 = 2 * m2`\n\nThe sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n`m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nMultiplying by `c^2`, we can express this in terms of rest-mass energy:\n`(m1 * c^2) + (m2 * c^2) = 0.99 * (M * c^2)`\nLet `E1 = m1 * c^2` and `E2 = m2 * c^2` be the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\n`E1 + E2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nFrom `m1 = 2 * m2`, we also have `E1 = 2 * E2`.\nNow we solve the system of two equations:\n1. `E1 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n2. `E1 = 2 * E2`\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`2 * E2 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * E2 = 297 GeV`\n`E2 = 99 GeV`\n\nThen, `E1 = 2 * E2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is `E1 = 198 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (T) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy:\n`T_total = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (E1 + E2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Classical (Non-relativistic) Calculation of T1:**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2|`.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSo, `p^2 = 2 * m * T`.\nSince the momenta are equal, `p1^2 = p2^2`:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`\n`T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n\nWe also know that `T1_classical + T2_classical = T_total = 3 GeV`.\nSubstituting `T2_classical`:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**Relativistic (Correct) Calculation of T1:**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy `E_tot`, momentum `p`, and rest energy `E_rest` is `(E_tot)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`.\nKinetic energy is `T = E_tot - E_rest`. So `E_tot = T + E_rest`.\nSubstituting this into the energy-momentum relation:\n`(T + E_rest)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*E_rest + (E_rest)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`\n\nAgain, from conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*E1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E2`\nWe know `E1 = 198 GeV`, `E2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = T_total - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`.\nLet's substitute these values (energies are in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Calculate the Difference:**\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_classical`).\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV.\n`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>"
