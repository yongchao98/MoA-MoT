    "An elegant way to solve this problem is to consider the properties of the Pauli matrices. Let's analyze the operator $M = \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}$. We will find its eigenvalues first, and then the eigenvalues of the full Hamiltonian $H = \\varepsilon M$.\n\n1.  **Define the operator**\n    The operator in question is $M = \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\sigma_x n_x + \\sigma_y n_y + \\sigma_z n_z$.\n    The Hamiltonian is $H = \\varepsilon M$. If $\\lambda_M$ are the eigenvalues of $M$, then the eigenvalues of $H$ will be $\\lambda_H = \\varepsilon \\lambda_M$.\n\n2.  **Square the operator M**\n    Let's compute $M^2$:\n    $M^2 = (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (\\sum_i n_i \\sigma_i)(\\sum_j n_j \\sigma_j) = \\sum_{i,j} n_i n_j \\sigma_i \\sigma_j$\n    where the indices $i, j$ run over $\\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\n3.  **Use the properties of Pauli matrices**\n    The Pauli matrices obey the following key relations:\n    *   $\\sigma_i^2 = I$ (for $i = x, y, z$), where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   $\\sigma_i \\sigma_j = -\\sigma_j \\sigma_i$ for $i \\neq j$ (they anticommute).\n\n    Let's expand the sum for $M^2$:\n    $M^2 = n_x^2 \\sigma_x^2 + n_y^2 \\sigma_y^2 + n_z^2 \\sigma_z^2 + n_x n_y (\\sigma_x \\sigma_y + \\sigma_y \\sigma_x) + n_x n_z (\\sigma_x \\sigma_z + \\sigma_z \\sigma_x) + n_y n_z (\\sigma_y \\sigma_z + \\sigma_z \\sigma_y)$\n\n    Using the properties above:\n    *   The first three terms become: $n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)I$.\n    *   The terms in the parentheses are zero due to the anticommutation relation, e.g., $\\sigma_x \\sigma_y + \\sigma_y \\sigma_x = \\sigma_x \\sigma_y - \\sigma_x \\sigma_y = 0$.\n\n    So, the expression for $M^2$ simplifies to:\n    $M^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)I$\n\n4.  **Use the property of the unit vector n**\n    The problem states that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, which means its magnitude is 1. Therefore, $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\n    Substituting this into our result for $M^2$:\n    $M^2 = 1 \\cdot I = I$\n\n5.  **Determine the eigenvalues**\n    Let $\\lambda_M$ be an eigenvalue of the operator $M$. Then, $\\lambda_M^2$ must be an eigenvalue of the operator $M^2$.\n    Since $M^2 = I$, its eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of the identity matrix, which are both 1.\n    Therefore, we must have:\n    $\\lambda_M^2 = 1$\n    This implies that the eigenvalues of $M = \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ are $\\lambda_M = \\pm 1$.\n\n6.  **Find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H**\n    The Hamiltonian is $H = \\varepsilon M$. The eigenvalues of $H$, denoted by $E$, are related to the eigenvalues of $M$ by $E = \\varepsilon \\lambda_M$.\n    Substituting the eigenvalues of $M$:\n    $E = \\varepsilon (\\pm 1) = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
