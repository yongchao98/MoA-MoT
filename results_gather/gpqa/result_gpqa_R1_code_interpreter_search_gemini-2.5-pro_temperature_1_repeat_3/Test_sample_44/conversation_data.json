    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Identical Fermions and the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\n    The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    So, the single-particle energy levels are `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down) without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n\n1.  **Level n=1:** We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, `n=1`. One will be spin-up, the other spin-down.\n    *   Energy of these two particles = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n2.  **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in the next available energy level, `n=2`.\n    *   Energy of these two particles = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the lowest energy above the ground state. We can find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n*   The new configuration of particles is:\n    *   2 particles in `n=1` (Energy: `2 * E_1 = 2E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=2` (Energy: `1 * E_2 = 4E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=3` (Energy: `1 * E_3 = 1 * (3^2 * E) = 9E`)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\nLet's list the energies of a few possible low-energy configurations:\n\n*   **Ground State:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2} -> Energy = `(2*1 + 2*4)E = 10E`.\n*   **First Excited State:** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3} -> Energy = `(2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9)E = 15E`.\n*   **Other Excitations:**\n    *   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9)E = (1 + 8 + 9)E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2*1 + 2*9)E = (2 + 18)E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration becomes {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2*1 + 1*4 + 1*16)E = (2 + 4 + 16)E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
