    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Spin State:**\n    The electron's spin state is given by a column vector `|ψ⟩`.\n    `|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T`\n\n2.  **Normalize the Spin State:**\n    The expectation value formula requires a normalized state vector. First, we calculate the squared norm `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`. The bra `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|ψ⟩`.\n    `⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4]`\n    The inner product is:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n    The normalization constant `N` is `1 / sqrt(⟨ψ|ψ⟩) = 1 / sqrt(25) = 1/5`.\n    The normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n    `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * [3i, 4]^T`\n\n3.  **Define the Spin Operator:**\n    The spin operator in the y-direction, `S_y`, is defined in terms of the Pauli matrix `σ_y` and the reduced Planck constant `ħ` (hbar).\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\n    Given the Pauli matrix `σ_y`:\n    `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    So, the spin operator is:\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    The expectation value `<S_y>` is calculated using the formula:\n    `<S_y> = ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩`\n    This can also be written as:\n    `<S_y> = (1/⟨ψ|ψ⟩) * ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = (1/25) * ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩`\n\n    Let's first compute the term `S_y |ψ⟩`:\n    `S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n    `S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(0 * 3i) + (-i * 4), (i * 3i) + (0 * 4)]^T`\n    `S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, 3i²]^T`\n    `S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T`\n\n    Now, we compute the full term `⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T`\n    `⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i * -4i) + (4 * -3)]`\n    `⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]`\n    `⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]`\n    `⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-24] = -12ħ`\n\n    Finally, we divide by the normalization factor `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25`:\n    `<S_y> = (-12ħ) / 25 = -12*hbar/25`\n\nTo verify the result, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the spin state vector (ket)\n# Use 'j' for the imaginary unit in Python\npsi = np.array([3j, 4])\n\n# Define the Pauli-Y matrix\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]])\n\n# The spin operator S_y is (hbar/2) * sigma_y. We can calculate the expectation\n# value of sigma_y and multiply by hbar/2 at the end.\n# <S_y> = <psi| S_y |psi> / <psi|psi>\n# <S_y> = (hbar/2) * <psi| sigma_y |psi> / <psi|psi>\n\n# Calculate the conjugate transpose of psi (bra)\npsi_dagger = np.conjugate(psi).T\n\n# Calculate the normalization factor <psi|psi>\nnorm_sq = np.dot(psi_dagger, psi)\n\n# Calculate <psi| sigma_y |psi>\nexp_val_sigma_y_numerator = np.dot(psi_dagger, np.dot(sigma_y, psi))\n\n# The result is a complex number, but the expectation value of a\n# Hermitian operator (like S_y) must be real.\n# We take the real part, which also handles potential floating point inaccuracies.\nexp_val_sigma_y = np.real(exp_val_sigma_y_numerator / norm_sq)\n\n# The result for <S_y> will be exp_val_sigma_y * (hbar/2)\n# The question asks for the coefficient of hbar.\n# The coefficient is exp_val_sigma_y / 2\n# Let's calculate the final coefficient of hbar.\n# We have <S_y> = (-12 * hbar), so <S_y> / <psi|psi> = (-12 * hbar) / 25\n# So the expectation value is -12*hbar/25. The fraction is -12/25.\n\n# Let's calculate the full numerator <psi| S_y |psi> (excluding hbar/2 for now)\nnumerator = np.dot(psi_dagger, np.dot(sigma_y, psi))\n\n# And the denominator <psi|psi>\ndenominator = np.dot(psi_dagger, psi)\n\n# The expectation value of sigma_y\nexpectation_sigma_y = numerator / denominator\n\n# The expectation value of S_y is (hbar/2) * expectation_sigma_y\n# The question asks for the value in terms of hbar, so we need to find the coefficient.\n# Coefficient = (expectation_sigma_y.real / 2)\n# However, the calculation above gives the full value:\n# <S_y> = (-12hbar) / 25. The coefficient is -12/25.\n# Let's print the numerator and denominator to confirm the manual calculation.\n# Numerator should be -24, Denominator should be 25.\n# Let's calculate numerator = <psi|sigma_y|psi>\nnumerator_sy = np.dot(psi_dagger, np.dot(sigma_y, psi))\nprint(f\"Numerator <psi|sigma_y|psi>: {numerator_sy.real}\")\nprint(f\"Denominator <psi|psi>: {denominator.real}\")\n\n# The expectation value <S_y> = (hbar/2) * (<psi|sigma_y|psi> / <psi|psi>)\n# <S_y> = (hbar/2) * (-24 / 25) = -12*hbar/25\nprint(\"The fraction for the expectation value is -12/25.\")\n\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nNumerator <psi|sigma_y|psi>: -24.0\nDenominator <psi|psi>: 25.0\nThe fraction for the expectation value is -12/25.\n```\nThe python code confirms the manual calculation. The expectation value of `S_y` is `-12*hbar/25`. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 12*hbar/25\nB) 25*hbar/2\nC) -12*hbar/25\nD) -25*hbar/2\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
