    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the products using different chromatographic techniques.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   H\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n               H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reagents and Transformation:**\n    *   **Step 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid)**. This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Reacting the *trans*-alkene with mCPBA can occur from the top or bottom face, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺)**. This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite the epoxide ring, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation. There is a general rule for the stereochemistry of such additions:\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a **meso** compound (if the product molecule has a plane of symmetry, which octane-4,5-diol does).\n\n    Let's verify this. Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, backside attack by water at either C4 or C5 will invert the stereocenter, leading to (4S,5R)- or (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are, in fact, the same meso compound. The same meso product is formed from the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n    Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol** [(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol].\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n               H   H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reagents and Transformation:** The reagents and overall transformation are the same as in Reaction 1: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the corresponding stereochemical rule:\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n\n    Let's verify. The epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene produces a single, achiral *meso*-epoxide [(cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane]. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening involves water attacking the two prochiral carbons (C4 and C5) from the backside. Attack at C4 and attack at C5 are equally probable and lead to a pair of enantiomeric products.\n    Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis (HPLC)**\n\nThe question assumes the highest theoretically possible resolution.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the (4R,5R)/(4S,5S) pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated on a standard achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The achiral HPLC will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: Meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   It can separate all stereoisomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities, which causes them to have different retention times.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are also readily separated.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture. It will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: Meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
