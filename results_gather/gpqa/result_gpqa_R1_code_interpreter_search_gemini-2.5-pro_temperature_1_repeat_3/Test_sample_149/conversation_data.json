    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we need to deduce the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO from its 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A DoU of 4 is typical for a benzene ring, and the remaining 1 corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (1 proton sees 2 adjacent protons, 2+1=3, a triplet).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of an amino group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting means it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which is consistent with it being coupled to the aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Let's check if the structure, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (or 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde), matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n        *   Benzene ring (C6H4) + Amino group (NH2) + Acetaldehyde group (C2H3O) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO.\n    *   The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n    The starting material is:\n    ```\n        O=CH-CH2-Ph-NH2 (para-substituted)\n    ```\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we trace the starting material through the given series of reactions.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    *   These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The reaction is typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    *   The primary amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The product of this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt solution and warming it up results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard method to synthesize phenols from anilines.\n    *   The product of this step is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (or 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n    ```\n        O=CH-CH2-Ph-OH (para-substituted)\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting the product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde that has protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons).\n    *   Aldehydes with α-hydrogens undergo a base-catalyzed aldol condensation. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, this will be a self-condensation.\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n        1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n            The structure of the aldol addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (C).\n        2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction mixture is heated. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. The α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            The formation of the conjugated system (C=C double bond conjugated with both a phenyl ring and the carbonyl group) makes this dehydration step thermodynamically favorable.\n\n    Let's determine the structure of the final condensation product:\n    *   Aldol addition product: `(HO-Ph)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO`\n    *   Dehydration removes the -OH from C3 and an -H from C2:\n    *   Final Product: `(HO-Ph)-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO`\n    *   The systematic name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Matching the Product with Options**\n\n*   The final product derived from the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n*   Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure and lacks hydroxyl groups.\n    *   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This perfectly matches our derived final product.\n    *   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n    *   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
