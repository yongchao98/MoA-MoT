    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction:** According to the principles of electrostatics, this charge `+q` will induce charges on the surfaces of the conductor.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside a conductor must be zero. Therefore, the net electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. By Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_o}$), the total charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. Since the charge `+q` is inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to make the net enclosed charge zero (`+q` + `-q` = 0).\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (zero net charge). Since a charge of `-q` has been induced on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge conservation (net charge = 0 + (`-q`) + (`+q`) = 0).\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The conductor material shields the region outside it from the electric fields created by charges inside the cavity. The combined electric field produced by the point charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** As a result of the shielding effect, the electric field at any point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface. Since this surface is a sphere and there are no other external charges, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface of the conductor. The location of the cavity and the charge inside it do not affect this uniform distribution on the outer surface because of the shielding.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at an external point is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = Center of the conductor (let's call it O).\n    *   Distance of the point P from the center O = `L`.\n\n8.  **Final Formula:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `\\theta` are all extraneous details designed to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding. They are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
