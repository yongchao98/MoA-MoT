An observer on Earth will measure a much longer travel time than the astronaut on the spacecraft because the spacecraft is moving at a speed very close to the speed of light. The time experienced by the astronaut is called the \"proper time\" (Δt₀), while the time observed from Earth is the \"coordinate time\" (Δt).\n\n2.  **Identify Knowns and Unknowns:**\n    *   Speed of the spacecraft (v) = 0.99999987 * c\n    *   Astronaut's initial age = 22 years\n    *   Alien average lifetime = 150 years\n    *   Destination: Earth, from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\n    *   Unknown: The time elapsed for the astronaut (Δt₀).\n\n3.  **Find Necessary Information:** To calculate the travel time, we need the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. A quick search reveals that the distance to the LMC is not a single fixed number, with estimates ranging from about 157,000 to 165,000 light-years. A commonly used value is around 160,000 light-years. We will use this as a starting point, but recognize that the intended distance in the problem might be one that results in one of the exact answers.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor is a key component in relativistic calculations. It describes how much time, length, and mass are altered for a moving object.\n    *   The formula is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   Let β = v/c = 0.99999987\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\n    *   To calculate this accurately, we can use the identity (1 - β²) = (1 - β)(1 + β):\n        *   1 - β = 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013 (or 1.3 x 10⁻⁷)\n        *   1 + β = 1 + 0.99999987 = 1.99999987\n    *   γ = 1 / √( (1.3 x 10⁻⁷) * 1.99999987 )\n    *   γ = 1 / √(2.599999831 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.00050990193\n    *   γ ≈ 1961.16\n\n5.  **Calculate the Travel Time from Earth's Perspective (Δt):**\n    *   The formula is Time = Distance / Speed.\n    *   Let's use a distance (d) of 160,000 light-years.\n    *   Δt = d / v = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n    *   Since a light-year is c * (1 year), the 'c' cancels out.\n    *   Δt ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.02 years.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Travel Time for the Astronaut (Δt₀):**\n    *   The time dilation formula is Δt = γ * Δt₀, which we can rearrange to Δt₀ = Δt / γ.\n    *   Δt₀ ≈ 160,000.02 years / 1961.16\n    *   Δt₀ ≈ 81.58 years.\n\n7.  **Analyze the Result and Options:**\n    *   The calculated travel time for the astronaut is approximately 81.58 years.\n    *   Let's check the astronaut's survival: The astronaut's age upon arrival would be 22 + 81.58 = 103.58 years. This is well within the 150-year lifespan, so option D is incorrect.\n    *   The calculated value of 81.58 years is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is due to the precise distance to the LMC assumed by the problem's author. If we assume the intended travel time is exactly 81 years, it would correspond to a distance of about 158,850 light-years, which is a perfectly valid estimate for the distance to the LMC.\n\nTherefore, the journey will take approximately 81 years from the astronaut's perspective.\n\n<<<A>>>"
