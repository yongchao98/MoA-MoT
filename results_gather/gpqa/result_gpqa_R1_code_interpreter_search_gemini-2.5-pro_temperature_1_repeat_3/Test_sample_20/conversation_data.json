    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where molecules can interconvert by the migration of an atom (usually hydrogen) and a shift in the location of a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds. The molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized, not sp³. They do not have the type of alpha-hydrogens required for standard keto-enol tautomerism. Converting it to its corresponding \"enol\" form (hydroquinone, C₆H₆(OH)₂) would require adding two hydrogen atoms, changing the molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂. Since tautomers must have the same molecular formula, this is a redox reaction, not tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms (-CH₂-). These are alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the negative charge on the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by two adjacent carbonyl groups. This compound readily undergoes tautomerism to form its enol, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**, which has the same molecular formula (C₆H₆O₃). The enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism** (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule has a center of symmetry and is planar, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image. It contains no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
