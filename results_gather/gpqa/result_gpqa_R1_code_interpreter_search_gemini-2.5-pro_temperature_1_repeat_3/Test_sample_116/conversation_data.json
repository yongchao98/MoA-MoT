    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user wants to identify which of the four given organic compounds can exhibit optical isomerism.\n2.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups), but other sources exist, such as axial chirality (atropisomerism). A key test for chirality is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. If a molecule has either of these symmetry elements, it is **achiral** and will not be optically active.\n\n3.  **Analyze each compound:**\n\n    *   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The positions ortho to the linking bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** These large groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is called **atropisomerism**. Since the molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   **Key Feature:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2, which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism (existing as R and S enantiomers).\n\n    *   **3. benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C6H5)2CO or Ph-C(=O)-Ph.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), so it's sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry**. Imagine a plane cutting through the C=O bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. The left half of the molecule is a mirror image of the right half. Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is trans-CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n        *   **Key Feature:** It is a planar molecule due to the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. It also has a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself). The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Compound 1 is chiral (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 is chiral (chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is achiral (plane of symmetry).\n    *   Compound 4 is achiral (center of inversion and plane of symmetry).\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
