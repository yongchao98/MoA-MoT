    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The field has a magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and points radially outwards from the origin. In vector notation, using spherical coordinates, this is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   **Volume (V):** The integration is over the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   **Integral:** We need to calculate `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**2. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nDirectly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrating over the volume can be problematic. Let's see why:\nThe formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r` (since `f_θ` and `f_φ` are zero).\nHere, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\nSo, `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\nIf we naively integrate this, we get `∫_V 0 dV = 0`. However, this is incorrect because the vector field `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and the formula for divergence is not valid there. The divergence is actually a Dirac delta function at the origin.\n\nA more robust method is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a field to the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\nThis method works because the surface `S` is at `r=R`, where the field is well-behaved (not singular). The surface integral correctly accounts for the effect of the singularity inside the volume.\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nWe need to calculate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Field on the surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n\n*   **Surface element (dS):** For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. The direction of this area element is normal to the surface, which is the radial direction. So, the vector `dS` is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n*   **Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element.\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n*   **Integrate over the surface:** We integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical angles are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nWe evaluate the integral in two steps:\n1.  **Inner integral (with respect to θ):**\n    `∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_{0}^{π}`\n    `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0))`\n    `= -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n2.  **Outer integral (with respect to φ):**\n    `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_{0}^{2π}`\n    `= 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBy the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`). Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
