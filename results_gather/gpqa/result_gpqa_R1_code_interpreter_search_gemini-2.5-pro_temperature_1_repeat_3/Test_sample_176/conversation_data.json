    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** For a star radiating as a black body, its luminosity ($L$) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    where $A$ is the surface area ($4\\pi R^2$), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the surface temperature.\n    So, the formula becomes:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the luminosities for Star_1 and Star_2 and then find their ratio:\n    $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    The ratio is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information about Radii:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$).\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radii is $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    The squared ratio is $\\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars *appeared brightest* is the same for both. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$). So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). The relationship between the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) and the observed wavelength is given by:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_r}{c}\\right)$\n        where $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1, $v_{r1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1} (1 + 0) = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)$\n    *   Now, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the *emitted* peak wavelength to the star's surface temperature:\n        $\\lambda_{em} = \\frac{b}{T}$\n        where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n    *   Substituting this into our equation:\n        $\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)$\n    *   Canceling $b$ and rearranging to find the temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c} \\implies \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Now we substitute all the parts back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}\\right)^4$\n\n7.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** We use the given values:\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n    Let's compute the value using a script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# The ratio of radii squared\nR_ratio_sq = R1_over_R2**2\n\n# The Doppler factor for Star 2\ndoppler_factor = 1 + vr2 / c\n\n# The ratio of temperatures to the fourth power.\n# From the reasoning, (T1/T2) = 1 / doppler_factor\nT_ratio_fourth = (1 / doppler_factor)**4\n\n# The final luminosity ratio L1/L2\nL_ratio = R_ratio_sq * T_ratio_fourth\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n2.2290074251235123\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation gives a result of approximately 2.229.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Luminosity of a Black Body:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n        $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n        where $A$ is the star's surface area ($4\\pi R^2$), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the surface temperature of the star. Substituting the area, the formula becomes:\n        $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the surface temperature ($T$) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{em}$, the emitted peak wavelength).\n        $\\lambda_{em} = b/T$\n        where $b$ is Wien's constant. This means temperature is inversely proportional to the peak emitted wavelength.\n    *   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the wavelength emitted by the source ($\\lambda_{em}$). For a source moving with a radial velocity $v_r$ (positive for moving away, negative for moving closer), the non-relativistic formula is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_r}{c}\\right)$\n        where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    We can write the expression for the luminosity of each star and then divide them:\n    $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    The ratio is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radii:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$. Therefore, the ratio of the radii is $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    *   **Peak Wavelengths:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   **Radial Velocities:** We are given $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s.\n    *   **Masses:** The information about mass ($M_1 = 1.5 \\cdot M_2$) is not needed for this calculation since we are using the black body radiation laws, which depend on radius and temperature, not mass.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n    *   First, we relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths using the Doppler effect.\n        For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1} \\left(1 + \\frac{0}{c}\\right) = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n        For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)$.\n    *   Next, we use Wien's Law ($T = b/\\lambda_{em}$) to relate the wavelengths to temperatures.\n        $T_1 = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{em,1}}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{em,2}}$.\n        Therefore, $\\lambda_{em,1} = b/T_1$ and $\\lambda_{em,2} = b/T_2$.\n    *   Substitute these into the wavelength equation:\n        $\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)$\n    *   Cancel Wien's constant $b$ and rearrange to find the temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right) \\implies \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}$\n        So, $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Now substitute the expressions for the radius ratio and the temperature ratio back into our main luminosity ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}\\right)^4$\n\n7.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700 \\times 10^3 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$ (speed of light)\n\n    We can perform this calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nR_ratio = 1.5\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nc = 299792458     # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the squared radius ratio\nR_ratio_squared = R_ratio**2\n\n# Calculate the fourth power of the temperature ratio\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2/c)\nT_ratio_fourth = (1 / (1 + vr2 / c))**4\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\nLuminosity_ratio = R_ratio_squared * T_ratio_fourth\n\nprint(Luminosity_ratio)\n\n```\n<execute_code>\n2.2290074251235123\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation yields a value of approximately 2.229.

    "The reasoning and calculation have been performed and verified.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  The luminosity ($L$) of a star treated as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n2.  The ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2 is therefore $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$.\n3.  We are given $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n4.  The temperatures are related through Wien's Displacement Law ($\\lambda_{em} \\propto 1/T$) and the Doppler effect ($\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1+v_r/c)$).\n5.  Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$), and Star_1 has zero radial velocity ($v_{r1}=0$), we find the temperature ratio to be $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$.\n6.
