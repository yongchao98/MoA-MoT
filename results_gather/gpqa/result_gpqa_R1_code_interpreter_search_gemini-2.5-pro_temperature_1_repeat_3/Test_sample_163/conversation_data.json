    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of binary system_1 (M1) to the total mass of binary system_2 (M2). The total mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its two stars (M_total = m_a + m_b).\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 'a' (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 'b' (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 'a' (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 'b' (K2b) = 10 km/s\n    *   **Crucial Information:** Both systems are \"eclipsing\". This tells us that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. Therefore, `sin(i)` is approximately 1.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Formula:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (M = m_a + m_b) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K_a and K_b) using a combination of Kepler's Third Law and the definition of radial velocity. The formula is:\n    ```\n    M_total * sin^3(i) = (P / (2 * pi * G)) * (K_a + K_b)^3\n    ```\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Apply the \"Eclipsing\" Condition:** Since both binaries are eclipsing, we can assume `i ≈ 90°`, which means `sin(i) ≈ 1` and `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. The formula simplifies to:\n    ```\n    M_total = (P * (K_a + K_b)^3) / (2 * pi * G)\n    ```\n    This shows that the total mass `M_total` is directly proportional to the period `P` and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes `(K_a + K_b)^3`.\n    ```\n    M_total ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)^3\n    ```\n\n5.  **Set up the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n    ```\n    M1 / M2 = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3 ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3 ]\n    ```\n    The constant of proportionality `1 / (2 * pi * G)` cancels out from the numerator and the denominator.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Sum of Velocities:**\n    *   For system_1: K_sum_1 = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   For system_2: K_sum_2 = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n7.  **Substitute Values and Compute the Ratio:** Now, plug the known values into the ratio formula.\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K_sum_1 = 15 km/s\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K_sum_2 = 25 km/s\n\n    ```\n    M1 / M2 = [ 2 * (15)^3 ] / [ 1 * (25)^3 ]\n    ```\n    To perform this calculation, I will use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0 # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2a = 15.0 # km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # km/s\n\n# Sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_sum_1 = K1a + K1b\nK_sum_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# The ratio of the masses is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K_sum_1)**3) / (P2 * (K_sum_2)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.7\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation have been completed.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n1.  The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is given by the formula `M_total * sin^3(i) = (P / (2 * pi * G)) * (K_a + K_b)^3`.\n2.  Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume the inclination angle `i` is 90 degrees, which makes `sin^3(i)` equal to 1.\n3.  Therefore, the mass `M_total` is directly proportional to `P * (K_a + K_b)^3`.\n4.  The ratio of the mass of system 1 (M1) to the mass of system 2 (M2) can be calculated as:\n    `M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3]`\n5.  Plugging in the given values:\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1a + K1b = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2a + K2b = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n6.  The calculation becomes:\n    `M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)^3] / [1 * (25)^3]`\n    `M1 / M2 = (2 * 3375) / 15625`\n    `M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625`\n7.  The Python code executed this calculation and returned the result `0.432`.\n8.  Comparing this result to the given options, `0.432` is approximately `0.4`.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
