    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The melting point of B.**\n    The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    Converting Kelvin to Celsius: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15.\n    T(°C) = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the formation of B and identify G.**\n    Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a typical decomposition reaction for a hydrate or a deuterated hydroxide. Given that a precipitate (G) is formed in the initial reaction, G is likely a metal deuteroxide.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1 & 10: The nature of Substance X.**\n    Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Since we've identified D₂O, the heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This, combined with the presence of deuterium, points towards common deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their non-deuterated analogs (LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄) are staples in organic chemistry.\n\n4.  **Propose identities for X, Y, W, and G and test the reaction.**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Reaction with liquid Y:** LiAlD₄ is known to react violently with water and similar protic solvents.\n    *   **Formation of gas W:** Clue 3 states that gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n        *   If Y were normal water (H₂O), the reaction would be LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4HD. The gas is HD (Hydrogen Deuteride). Let's check its composition: Protons = 1 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 0 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 1. Protons ≠ Neutrons. So, Y is not H₂O.\n        *   What if liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)? The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n        *   Let's check the gas W = D₂ (Deuterium gas). Composition: Protons = 1 + 1 = 2. Neutrons = 1 + 1 = 2. Protons = Neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n    *   **Formation of precipitate G:** In this reaction, the products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate, so it's certain that Al(OD)₃ would be a precipitate as well. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G to get B:** When Al(OD)₃ is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O, which we identified as substance B. This also fits.\n\n5.  **Confirm with Clue 9: The reaction with a keto acid.**\n    A keto acid has both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce both functional groups to alcohols (hydroxyl groups, -OH).\n    *   Ketone reduction: R-CO-R' → R-CD(OH)-R'\n    *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CD₂OH\n    The final product would be a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups), for example, HO-CD₂-R'-CD(OH)-R. This molecule contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This final clue confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the required value.**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminium**.\n    *   The question states to sum the masses of *all* instances of these elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of hydrogen, all as the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        Cumulative mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** The molecule contains one atom of aluminium. The mass number of the most stable isotope of aluminium (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        Cumulative mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Final Sum:** Sum of the two cumulative masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
