    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the four statements.\n\nThe **impulse approximation** is a simplifying assumption used in describing high-energy scattering from a composite system like a nucleus. The core idea is that if the interaction between a projectile (like an electron or neutrino) and a constituent of the target (a nucleon) happens very quickly, it can be treated as a two-body collision between the projectile and that single constituent. The other parts of the system are considered \"spectators\" because the interaction is over before they have time to react or influence the event. The target nucleon is treated as if it were a *free* particle, but with the momentum it happened to have inside the nucleus at the moment of interaction.\n\nNow let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is a fundamental premise of the impulse approximation. The model assumes the probe interacts with a single nucleon, not with the nucleus as a whole or with multi-nucleon currents (like meson exchange currents). This is often called the \"one-body approximation\" and is essential for treating the problem as a quasi-free scattering event. This statement is **necessary**.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This assumption addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. It means we neglect Initial State Interactions (ISI), where the incoming probe scatters from other nucleons before hitting the target one, and Final State Interactions (FSI), where the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) re-interact with the residual nucleus. While technically FSI are corrections *to* the impulse approximation, in the simplest and most common application, known as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), this \"transparency\" is a key part of the model. It's required to cleanly relate the measured final state to the properties of the single nucleon that was struck. This statement is **necessary** for the approximation to be practically applied in its simplest form.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing it with a particular model (the non-relativistic quark model). The impulse approximation, however, is about the behavior of the nucleon *as a whole particle* within the nuclear environment. It can be applied independently of the specific model used for the nucleon's internal structure. For example, in deep inelastic scattering, the impulse approximation is used (in the form of the parton model), but the quarks are treated as highly relativistic point-like particles. Therefore, this statement is **not necessary**.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction is assumed to be so rapid and energetic that the relatively weak and slow-acting nuclear binding potential can be ignored *during* the short time of the collision. This is precisely what allows us to treat the bound nucleon as a \"free\" nucleon at the moment of interaction. This statement is **necessary**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe statements that jointly define the impulse approximation as it is commonly used in nuclear calculations are 1, 2, and 4.\n- Statement 1 sets up the interaction with a single target.\n- Statement 4 defines the \"impulse\" itself, treating the target as free.\n- Statement 2 ensures that the rest of the nucleus doesn't interfere before or after this single, free-like interaction.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
