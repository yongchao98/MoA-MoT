    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\nThe electromagnetic fields (and thus the potentials) at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the state of the source (charge and current) at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time** ($t_r$). This is because electromagnetic influences travel at the finite speed of light, $c$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is the time at which the signal must have been emitted from the charge's position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The relationship is given by:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nLet's use the notation provided in the problem:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge $q$ at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n\nWith this notation, the retarded time condition becomes:\n$c(t - t_r) = d$\n\n### 2. Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the retarded potentials for a continuous charge distribution $\\rho$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}$ are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for $V$ gives:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nThe evaluation of this integral is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$. A standard derivation (found in most advanced E&M textbooks like Griffiths or Jackson) shows that the motion of the source introduces a correction factor to the denominator. This factor accounts for the fact that the volume of the charge distribution appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} \\right]_{t_r} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nIn these expressions, all quantities on the right-hand side ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the unique retarded time $t_r$ determined by the observation point $(\\vec{r},t)$.\n\n### 3. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite our derived potentials to match the format of the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: This is incorrect. It uses the static potential form and an incorrect relation for $\\vec{A}$.\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: This has a plus sign in the denominator. The correct sign is minus. A plus sign would imply that the potential is weaker when the charge moves towards the observer, which is physically incorrect.\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: The expression for $V$ is incorrect as it neglects retardation and the motion effect. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is true for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for $V$ itself is wrong.\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: These expressions perfectly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
