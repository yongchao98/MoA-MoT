    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential energy for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three dimensions (x, y, z).\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates. The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n    The energy levels for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n    Therefore, the total energy for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n    The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    We need to identify the value of $n$ for the ground state and the first few excited states.\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy state, which corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative integers, the minimum value for their sum is $n = 0+0+0 = 0$.\n        Energy of the ground state: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level up, corresponding to $n=1$.\n        Energy of the first excited state: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        Energy of the second excited state: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        Energy of the third excited state: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (in this case, combinations of $n_x, n_y, n_z$) that have the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\n    Let's list the possible combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1). This gives 1 state.\n\n    The total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, there is a general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 11 $\\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\n    B) 11 $\\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10 - Incorrect energy.\n    C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 10 - Correct energy and degeneracy.\n    D) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 3 - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
