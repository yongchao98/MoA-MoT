    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The given potential is $V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$.\n    The Schrödinger equation is difficult to solve directly in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ because the potential term does not allow for separation of variables in $r$ and $\\theta$. A term like $f(r)g(\\theta)$ prevents the separation of variables method on the Schrödinger partial differential equation.\n\n2.  **Change of Coordinates:**\n    To simplify the problem, we convert the potential from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The conversion formulas are:\n    $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n    $y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n    $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    The first term is $\\frac{1}{2} k r^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2)$.\n    The second term is $\\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(\\theta))^2 = \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$.\n\n    Now, sum the terms to get the full potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n3.  **Separation of Variables in the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    The potential is now in the form $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, where:\n    $V_x(x) = 2 k x^2$\n    $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n    The 2D time-independent Schrödinger equation is:\n    $H\\psi = E\\psi$\n    $-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2})\\psi(x, y) + (V_x(x) + V_y(y))\\psi(x, y) = E \\psi(x, y)$\n\n    Since the potential is separable, the Hamiltonian is a sum of two independent 1D Hamiltonians, $H = H_x + H_y$. The total wavefunction can be written as a product of 1D wavefunctions, $\\psi(x, y) = \\psi_x(x)\\psi_y(y)$, and the total energy is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions, $E = E_x + E_y$.\n\n    The problem is now reduced to solving two independent 1D quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) problems.\n\n4.  **Solve the 1D QHO for the x-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_x(x) = 2 k x^2$. The standard form for a QHO potential is $\\frac{1}{2} k_{eff} x^2$.\n    Comparing these, we get $\\frac{1}{2} k_x x^2 = 2 k x^2$, which implies the effective spring constant is $k_x = 4k$.\n    The angular frequency of the oscillator is $\\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_x}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n    The energy levels for a 1D QHO are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    So, for the x-motion, the energy eigenvalues are:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar (2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}})$, where $n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n5.  **Solve the 1D QHO for the y-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$. This is already in the standard form.\n    The effective spring constant is $k_y = k$.\n    The angular frequency of this oscillator is $\\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_y}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$, where $n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies from the independent x and y motions:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar (2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    Factor out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n    $E = [2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2}] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
