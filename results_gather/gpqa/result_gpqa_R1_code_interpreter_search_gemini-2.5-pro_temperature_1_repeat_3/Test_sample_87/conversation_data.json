    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on a described experiment.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP. Rotavirus is a gut pathogen.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, mimicking natural infection route.\n    *   **Location of Response:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut responsible for initiating adaptive immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n    *   **Cellular Activity:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. This points to clonal expansion of lymphocytes (likely B cells or T cells) that have recognized the antigen.\n    *   **Key Molecular Finding:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these proliferating cells shows \"high variability.\"\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options in the context of the findings:**\n    *   The \"variable heavy chain gene\" is a component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) and the antibodies that B cells produce. The high variability is found in the part of the receptor that binds to the antigen.\n    *   The process is occurring in proliferating cells within a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure. This is characteristic of a germinal center reaction.\n\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial, vast repertoire of B-cell and T-cell receptors. It occurs in primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) during the development of naive lymphocytes, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening *after* antigen encounter in a secondary lymphoid organ. So, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes. So, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers. It changes the constant region of the antibody heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's effector function. However, CSR does *not* affect the variable region, which is responsible for antigen binding and is the source of the observed \"high variability.\" So, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a hallmark process of the germinal center reaction in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Activated B cells proliferate rapidly and the enzyme Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID) introduces point mutations specifically into the variable regions of their immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. B cells with mutations that improve antigen-binding affinity are selected to survive and differentiate further. This process is directly responsible for generating \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of proliferating B cells during an active immune response, leading to affinity maturation. This perfectly matches the experimental observations.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch following antigen stimulation is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
