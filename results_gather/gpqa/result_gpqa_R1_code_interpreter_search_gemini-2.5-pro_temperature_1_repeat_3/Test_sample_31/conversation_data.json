    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Properties:**\n    *   The problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n    *   Lithium's atomic number (Z) is 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n    *   The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons. A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium, specifically Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n2.  **State the Physical Principles:**\n    *   The total energy (E) of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by Einstein's equation:\n        E = γ * E₀\n    *   Where E₀ is the rest energy of the particle (E₀ = m₀c²) and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor, γ, is calculated as:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   Here, v is the particle's speed, and c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Determine the Necessary Values:**\n    *   **Speed (v):** The problem states v = 0.96c. This means the ratio v/c is 0.96.\n    *   **Rest Mass (m₀):** We need the rest mass of the $^6$Li nucleus. The most accurate way to find this is to take the atomic mass of a $^6$Li atom and subtract the mass of its electrons.\n        *   We need the atomic mass of $^6$Li.\n        *   We need the mass of an electron.\n        *   We need the conversion factor from atomic mass units (amu) to energy units (GeV, Giga-electron Volts).\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step 4a: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   v/c = 0.96\n        *   (v/c)² = 0.96² = 0.9216\n        *   1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784\n        *   √(1 - (v/c)²) = √0.0784 = 0.28\n        *   γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n\n    *   **Step 4b: Calculate the rest energy (E₀) of the $^6$Li nucleus.**\n        *   This requires high-precision constants. We will use a Python script for this calculation.\n        *   First, we calculate the nuclear mass by subtracting the mass of the 3 electrons from the atomic mass of $^6$Li.\n        *   Then, we convert this mass from atomic mass units (amu) to energy in Giga-electron Volts (GeV) using the conversion factor 1 amu ≈ 0.931494 GeV/c².\n\n    *   **Step 4c: Calculate the total energy (E).**\n        *   E = γ * E₀\n        *   The Python script below will perform steps 4b and 4c with high precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants based on NIST CODATA 2018 values\nv_over_c = 0.96\n# Atomic mass of a neutral Lithium-6 atom in amu\natomic_mass_li6_amu = 6.0151228874\n# Mass of an electron in amu\nmass_electron_amu = 0.000548579909065\n# Conversion factor from amu to GeV/c^2\namu_to_gev = 0.93149410242\n\n# Lithium has 3 protons, so a neutral atom has 3 electrons.\nnum_electrons = 3\n\n# 1.

Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 23.069 GeV\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 21.419 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.0054 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV. The small discrepancy (about 0.6%) is likely due to slightly different physical constants being used in the formulation of the question's options versus the high-precision NIST values used in this calculation. Given the choices, C is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We need to find the total relativistic energy (E) of a specific nucleus.\n    *   The nucleus is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium's atomic number is 3 (meaning 3 protons). So, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li), with 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n    *   The speed (v) of the nucleus is given as 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n    *   The required precision is 1e-4.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Equation:**\n    The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by Einstein's special theory of relativity:\n    E = γ * E₀\n    where:\n    *   E is the total relativistic energy.\n    *   E₀ is the rest energy of the particle (E₀ = m₀c²).\n    *   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   We are given v = 0.96c.\n    *   This means the ratio v/c = 0.96.\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96)²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28\n    *   γ ≈ 3.571428\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀):**\n    The rest energy depends on the rest mass (m₀) of the $^6$Li nucleus. There are two common ways to determine this mass:\n\n    *   **Method A (High Precision):** Use the experimentally measured atomic mass of a $^6$Li atom and subtract the mass of its electrons. This accounts for the nuclear binding energy.\n    *   **Method B (Approximation):** Sum the individual masses of the constituent protons and neutrons. This method ignores the nuclear binding energy, which is the energy released when the nucleus is formed (making the nucleus slightly lighter than its parts).\n\n    Often in physics problems of this type, especially with multiple-choice answers, the intended method is the simpler one (Method B) that ignores binding energy. Let's calculate using both methods to be sure. We will use a Python script for high-precision calculations using modern physical constants.\n\n    **The script will perform the following calculation:**\n    1.  Define the constants: mass of a proton, mass of a neutron, and the conversion factor from atomic mass units (amu) to GeV.\n    2.  Calculate the rest mass of the $^6$Li nucleus by summing the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n    3.  Convert this rest mass to rest energy (E₀) in GeV.\n    4.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for v = 0.96c.\n    5.  Compute the total energy E = γ * E₀.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants (NIST CODATA 2018) ---\n# Speed ratio\nv_over_c = 0.96\n# Mass of a proton in atomic mass units (amu)\nmass_proton_amu = 1.007276466621\n# Mass of a neutron in atomic mass units (amu)\nmass_neutron_amu = 1.00866491595\n# Conversion factor from amu to GeV/c^2\namu_to_gev = 0.93149410242\n\n# --- Nucleus Composition ---\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# 1. Calculate the rest mass (m0) by summing constituent nucleon masses\nm0_amu = (num_protons * mass_proton_amu) + (num_neutrons * mass_neutron_amu)\n\n# 2. Calculate the rest energy (E0) in GeV\nrest_energy_gev = m0_amu * amu_to_gev\n\n# 3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# 4. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E) in GeV\ntotal_energy_gev = gamma * rest_energy_gev\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{total_energy_gev:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n20.1190\nThe code calculates the total energy to be approximately 20.1190 GeV.\n\n5.  **Compare the Result with the Options:**\n    *   A) 18.475 GeV\n    *   B) 23.069 GeV\n    *   C) 20.132 GeV\n    *   D) 21.419 GeV\n\n    Our calculated value of 20.1190 GeV is extremely close to option C (20.132 GeV). The minor difference (less than 0.1%) is likely due to the use of slightly different (e.g., older or less precise) constants for the proton/neutron masses in the problem's original formulation. The calculation confirms that the intended method was to sum the constituent masses, ignoring binding energy.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the total relativistic energy of a Lithium-6 ($^6$Li) nucleus traveling at 96% of the speed of light.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Particle and its Properties:**\n    *   The nucleus is Lithium (Li), which has an atomic number of 3 (meaning 3 protons).\n    *   It is specified to have 3 neutrons.\n    *   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6. Thus, the particle is a $^6$Li nucleus.\n    *   The speed is v = 0.96c.\n\n2.  **State the Relevant Physics Formula:**\n    The total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by:\n    E = γ * E₀\n    where E₀ is the rest energy (E₀ = m₀c²) and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated based on the speed:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    Given v = 0.96c, the ratio v/c is 0.96.\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28\n    γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀):**\n    The rest energy is the energy equivalent of the nucleus's rest mass (m₀). For textbook problems, the rest mass is often approximated by summing the masses of its constituent nucleons (protons and neutrons), which neglects the nuclear binding energy.\n    *   Mass of 3 protons = 3 * m_p\n    *   Mass of 3 neutrons = 3 * m_n\n    *   m₀ = 3 * m_p + 3 * m_n\n\n    Using the code from the previous step, we calculated the rest energy by this method, converting the total mass from atomic mass units (amu) to Giga-electron Volts (GeV).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E):**\n    The final calculation combines the Lorentz factor and the rest energy:\n    E = γ * E₀\n\n    The Python code executed in the previous step performed this calculation with high precision:\n    *   It calculated the total rest mass of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n    *   It converted this mass to rest energy in GeV.\n    *   It multiplied the rest energy by the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The computed result was **20.1197 GeV**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated value is 20.1197 GeV. We compare this to the provided options:\n    *   A) 18.475 GeV\n    *   B) 23.069 GeV\n    *   C) 20.132 GeV\n    *   D) 21.419 GeV\n\n    The calculated value of 20.1197 GeV is extremely close to option C, 20.132 GeV. The very small difference of about 0.06% is due to the specific values of the physical constants (like proton mass) used when the problem was formulated. Option C is the clear intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
