    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The intensity ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which is very close to 3:1. This pattern is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight using the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl) is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. The molecular weight using the ³⁷Cl isotope is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158. All four options have this formula, so the MS data is consistent with any of them.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence allows us to eliminate option B (an aldehyde and a phenol) and option C (a chloroformate, which is an acid chloride derivative and would lack the broad O-H peak). We are left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region, at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm.\n        *   The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), which is consistent with a disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n        *   The splitting pattern is crucial. We see two doublets. This symmetric pattern is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. Each set splits the other into a doublet.\n        *   Option A, **4-chlorobenzoic acid**, is a 1,4-disubstituted ring and would produce this exact two-doublet pattern. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be at 7.72 ppm.\n        *   Option D, **2-chlorobenzoic acid**, is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) ring. This structure lacks the symmetry of the para isomer. It would have four chemically distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four different multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the combined evidence, the only structure that fits all the spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and presence of chlorine. The IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most importantly, the para substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<A>>>"
