    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve directly because most activating groups direct incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions (1,2 and 1,4 substitution), not to a third adjacent position (1,2,3). This suggests a multi-step synthesis where the directing properties of groups are carefully manipulated, possibly by converting one functional group to another.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on established principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a ring that has been reduced to aniline (from step ii), but the option sequence suggests alkylating the nitrobenzene first. Friedel-Crafts reactions (alkylation and acylation) fail or give very poor yields on strongly deactivated rings, such as nitrobenzene. The problem specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, making this route non-viable. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence has a major logical flaw. Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as a starting material. However, the amine is only formed much later in step (viii) by the reduction (`Fe/HCl`) of a nitro group. One cannot perform diazotization before the amine exists. **Therefore, Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This option also contains a chemically nonsensical step. After forming an amine (step iv) and converting it to a diazonium salt (step v), it suggests nitrating the diazonium salt (step vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used immediately as intermediates; they are not substrates for nitration. This step is incorrect. While there are Sandmeyer reactions to replace a diazonium group with -NO2, that would involve `NaNO2/Cu`, not `HNO3/H2SO4`. Even if it were a Sandmeyer reaction, it would be redundant, as it would re-introduce a nitro group that was just removed. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   Let's trace this sequence step-by-step. The last two steps (viii, ix) seem out of place, so let's first analyze steps (i) through (vii).\n\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is major. However, the ortho product (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To achieve the final 1,2,3 pattern, we must proceed with the ortho isomer.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine gives **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 2-tert-butylaniline:** Nitration of the aniline derivative. This is the crucial step for setting the 1,2,3-pattern. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a meta-director.\n        *   In 2-tert-butylaniline, the -NH3+ group (at C1) directs the incoming nitro group to position 3.\n        *   The -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director and does not favor substitution at C3.\n        *   In cases of conflicting directors, the outcome can be complex, but it is plausible that the meta-directing anilinium group can direct the nitration to C3, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**. This is the key to establishing the required 1,2,3 arrangement of functional groups.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline:** Diazotization of the primary amino group to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol:** Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence (i-vii) successfully produces the target molecule. The final two steps (viii and ix), sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are superfluous and would have no net effect if performed on the final product. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are chemically impossible, Option A presents a viable (though perhaps not truly \"high-yield\") pathway in its first seven steps. The last two steps are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy eliminating the other options based on fundamental chemical principles, Option A remains the only plausible choice, describing a logical sequence of reactions to achieve the desired complex substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
