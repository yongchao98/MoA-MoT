    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by each spectroscopic technique.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group is noted. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and two oxygen atoms. All the given formula options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) contain two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 aromatic protons.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n    *   **Six signals:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, such as para (1,4-substitution), which would give two signals (two doublets), each integrating to 2H. This is consistent with the C6H4 core.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This fragment contains one C=C double bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group's signal is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group. Since the problem states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**, it cannot be part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). Therefore, it must be a methyl group directly attached to the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH3). In either case, this methyl group is isolated and would appear as a singlet.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate several possibilities.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\nFrom the spectral data, we can sum the expected DBE:\n*   Aromatic ring: 1 ring + 3 π-bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given formulas using the formula: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 (for a compound with formula CxHyO2).\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. (Incorrect)\n*   **B) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. (Incorrect)\n*   **D) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n\nThis analysis eliminates options A and C. We are left with C12H14O2 and C11H12O2.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Molecular Structure and Final Verification\n\nLet's build the molecule from the fragments we've identified from the NMR data:\n1.  A di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4** (contributes 4H)\n2.  A propenyl group substituent: **-CH=CH-CH3** (contributes C3H5)\n3.  An ester substituent containing a methyl group, e.g., a methyl carboxylate group (**-COOCH3**, contributes C2H3O2) or an acetoxy group (**-OCOCH3**, contributes C2H3O2).\n\nLet's assemble these pieces and sum the atoms. For example, a possible structure is methyl 4-propenylbenzoate:\n*   **C atoms:** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from COOCH3) = **11 carbons**\n*   **H atoms:** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from COOCH3) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **O atoms:** 2 (from COOCH3) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting formula is **C11H12O2**. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data:\n*   It has the correct DBE of 6.\n*   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   It has an ester group.\n*   It contains a propenyl group giving the characteristic vinyl signals.\n*   It has two distinct methyl groups.\n*   It contains no CH2 groups.\n*   The total proton count (12H) matches the formula.\n\nNow, let's consider the other possibility, **C12H14O2**.\n*   This formula has the correct DBE of 6.\n*   However, compared to C11H12O2, it has one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (a \"CH2\" unit).\n*   To incorporate a CH2 unit into our proposed structure would create a -CH2- signal in the NMR spectrum.\n*   The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**.\n*   Furthermore, if we analyze the proton count for C12H14O2: Total H = 14. Aromatic H = 4. Vinyl H = 2. This leaves 14 - 4 - 2 = 8 protons. These 8 protons would have to be distributed among methyl groups (since CH2 is forbidden), which is impossible as 8 is not a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, the formula C12H14O2 is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the constraints from the FTIR and 1H NMR data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
