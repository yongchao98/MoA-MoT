    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   \"No vinyl-hydrogens\": This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four options are saturated, so this is consistent.\n    *   \"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\". This means a specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the doublet (d) splitting (n+1=2).\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the triplet (t) splitting (n+1=3).\n        *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing the quartet (q) splitting (n+1=4).\n        *   Note: The order of the letters (d, t, q) can vary depending on the relative size of the coupling constants (J-values), but the chemical meaning remains the same: the proton is coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H set of neighbors. We will look for a proton with this environment, which could be described as `dtq`, `dqt`, `tqd`, `tdq`, `qdt`, or `qtd`.\n    *   \"A different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\". This means another specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (d).\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (t).\n        *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second triplet (t).\n        *   We are looking for a proton coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and another 2H set of neighbors. This could be described as `dtt` or `tdt`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Structure of Each Option\n\nWe need to interpret the condensed structural formulas and predict the splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule. We will assume a standard linear interpretation of the formulas and use IUPAC naming to clarify the structures.\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This formula corresponds to **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H4**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H3` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH3(5)` (3 neighbors) -> quartet (q)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This matches the `dtq` signal required.\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `CH2(2)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   `H4` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt)**. A `tdt` pattern arises from coupling to (2H, 1H, 2H), while a `dtt` arises from (1H, 2H, 2H). Both are split by one proton and two different sets of two protons, resulting in 18 lines (in a first-order spectrum). Given the options, it is highly probable that this `tdt` signal is the one described as `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(Et)(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H2` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH2(4)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Does it have a `dqt` signal? Let's check other protons. H2 is a doublet of triplets (`dt`). The `CH2` protons are all doublets of quartets (`dq`). There is no proton coupled to (1H, 2H, 3H).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtt` but lacks a `dqt`.\n\n**C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(Me)(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH2(4)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H2` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH2(4)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   The `CH3` on its own carbon (3 neighbors) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Does it have a `dtt` signal? No. H2 is a `dq`. H4 is a `dq`. There is no proton coupled to (1H, 2H, 2H).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Proton H3 is coupled to `CH2(2)` (2H, t), `H4` (1H, d), and `CH3` on C3 (3H, q). This gives a `tdq`. This matches the `dtq` requirement.\n    *   Proton H4 is coupled to `H3` (1H, d) and the six protons of the isopropyl group (6H, septet). This gives a `doublet of septets`. It does not have a `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq`-type signal but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the splitting patterns for each structure, we find the following:\n*   **A) 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dqt` signal and a `tdt` signal.\n*   **B) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dtt` signal, but no `dqt` signal.\n*   **C) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dtq` signal, but no `dtt` signal.\n*   **D) 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `tdq` (or `dqt`) signal, but no `dtt` signal.\n\nOnly structure **A** possesses two different protons that exhibit the required high level of complex splitting: one proton is coupled to a (1H, 2H, 3H) environment, and another is coupled to a (1H, 2H, 2H) or (2H, 1H, 2H) environment. The signal described as `dtt` in the problem corresponds to the `tdt` signal from structure A. Therefore, structure A is the only option that fits all the data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
