    "The user wants to find the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n**1. Understand the given parameters:**\n*   Crystal system: Rhombohedral\n*   Lattice parameter, a = 10 Angstrom. In a rhombohedral system, all lattice parameters are equal (a = b = c).\n*   Interaxial angles, α = β = γ = 30°.\n*   Miller indices of the plane, (hkl) = (111).\n\n**2. Find the appropriate formula:**\nThe formula for the interplanar spacing, d_hkl, in a rhombohedral (or trigonal) crystal system is given by:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + hl)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n\n**3. Substitute the given values into the formula:**\n*   a = 10 Angstrom\n*   α = 30°\n*   h = 1, k = 1, l = 1\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the formula:\n*   h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3\n*   hk + kl + hl = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3\n*   sin(30°) = 0.5\n*   cos(30°) = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866025\n*   sin²(30°) = (0.5)² = 0.25\n*   cos²(30°) = (√3 / 2)² = 3/4 = 0.75\n*   cos³(30°) = (√3 / 2)³ = 3√3 / 8 ≈ 0.649519\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the numerator and denominator of the formula.\n\n**Numerator:**\n(h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + hl)(cos²α - cosα)\n= (3)(0.25) + 2(3)(0.75 - 0.866025)\n= 0.75 + 6(-0.116025)\n= 0.75 - 0.69615\n= 0.05385\n\n**Denominator:**\na²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)\n= 10²(1 - 3(0.75) + 2(0.649519))\n= 100(1 - 2.25 + 1.299038)\n= 100(-1.25 + 1.299038)\n= 100(0.049038)\n= 4.9038\n\n**4. Calculate 1/d²:**\n1/d² = Numerator / Denominator\n1/d² = 0.05385 / 4.9038\n1/d² ≈ 0.010981\n\n**5. Calculate d:**\nd² = 1 / 0.010981\nd² ≈ 91.066\nd = √91.066\nd ≈ 9.543 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom. This matches option D.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a python script to perform the calculation with higher precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\na = 10  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1\n\n# Convert angle to radians\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate trigonometric values\nsin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Numerator of the formula for 1/d^2\nnumerator = (h**2 + k**2 + l**2) * sin_alpha**2 + 2 * (h*k + k*l + h*l) * (cos_alpha**2 - cos_alpha)\n\n# Denominator of the formula for 1/d^2\ndenominator = a**2 * (1 - 3 * cos_alpha**2 + 2 * cos_alpha**3)\n\n# Calculate 1/d^2\none_over_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate d\nd = math.sqrt(1 / one_over_d_squared)\n\nprint(d)\n```\n<<<D>>>",
    "The interplanar distance, $d_{hkl}$, for a rhombohedral crystal system is given by the formula:\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d^2_{hkl}} = \\frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk + kl + hl)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\nGiven parameters:\n*   Lattice parameter, a = 10 Angstrom\n*   Interaxial angle, $\\alpha = 30^\\circ$\n*   Miller indices, (hkl) = (111)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the trigonometric values:\n*   $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 0.5$\n*   $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866$\n*   $\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n*   $\\cos^2(30^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$\n*   $\\cos^3(30^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\approx 0.650$\n\nNext, let's substitute the values into the formula:\n*   $h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3$\n*   $hk + kl + hl = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3$\n\nNow, calculate the numerator of the formula:\n*   Numerator = $(3)(0.25) + 2(3)(0.75 - 0.866)$\n*   Numerator = $0.75 + 6(-0.116)$\n*   Numerator = $0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054$\n\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n*   Denominator = $(10)^2(1 - 3(0.75) + 2(0.650))$\n*   Denominator = $100(1 - 2.25 + 1.30)$\n*   Denominator = $100(0.05) = 5$\n\nNow, we can find $\\frac{1}{d^2}$:\n*   $\\frac{1}{d^2} = \\frac{0.054}{5} = 0.0108$\n\nFinally, we calculate d:\n*   $d^2 = \\frac{1}{0.0108} \\approx 92.59$\n*   $d = \\sqrt{92.59} \\approx 9.62$ Angstrom\n\nThe slight discrepancy between the manual calculation and the code's output is due to rounding of trigonometric values during the manual steps. The code provides a more precise result. The output from the code execution is 9.542974392310578 Angstrom.\n\nRounding this value to two decimal places gives 9.54 Angstrom.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 9.08 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
