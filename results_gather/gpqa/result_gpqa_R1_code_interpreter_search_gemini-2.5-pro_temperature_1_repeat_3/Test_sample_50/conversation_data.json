    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The presence of the charge `q` induces a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. The net force between the charge `q` and the sphere is attractive. We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced charges on its surface, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at `r=R`) becomes zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (d'):**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `d'` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Position of the image charge: `d' = R^2 / d`\n    *   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n    The image charge is located along the same line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. The negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite polarity to `q`, which is consistent with an attractive force.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The work is done against the electrostatic force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n    The force `F(x)` on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is equal to the force between `q` and its image `q'(x)`.\n    *   At position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at position `x' = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `x - x' = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force on `q` is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - x')^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    *   The external force required to move the charge is `F_ext = -F(x)`.\n    *   The work done (potential energy) is `U = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_ext(x) dx`.\n    *   `U = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    *   To solve the integral, use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    *   `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫(from ∞ to d^2-R^2) u^-2 du`\n    *   `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]` evaluated from `∞` to `d^2-R^2`.\n    *   `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞)]`\n    *   `U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n    **Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n    The total energy of a system of conductors and charges is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n    *   In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere. The total charge on the sphere is `q_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * [q * V_at_q + q_induced * V_sphere]`\n    *   Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n    *   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. This potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The potential from `q'` at the location of `q` is `V_at_q = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`.\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   `V_at_q = k * (-R/d * q) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   Substituting this back into the energy formula:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Both methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    This expression matches option A.\n\n    *   A) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   B) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n    *   C) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   D) `U = - k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
