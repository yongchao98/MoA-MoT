    "The user wants to determine the kinematically allowed decay channels for a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Interaction and Decay\n\nThe interaction between the boson X and a fermion field $\\psi_f$ is given by the Lagrangian:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (v + X) \\psi_f = -\\lambda_f v \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f - \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f $$\nThe term $- \\lambda_f v \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$ is the mass term for the fermion $f$, so the fermion mass $m_f$ is proportional to the coupling $\\lambda_f$.\nThe term $- \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$ describes the interaction vertex where the boson X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This interaction allows the boson X to decay into a fermion and its antiparticle:\n$$ X \\rightarrow f \\bar{f} $$\n\n### 2. Kinematic Condition for Decay\n\nFor any decay process to be possible, it must be kinematically allowed. This means the mass of the initial particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the final state particles.\n\nFor the decay $X \\rightarrow f \\bar{f}$, the condition is:\n$$ m_X \\ge m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ m_X \\ge 2 m_f $$\n\n### 3. Applying the Condition\n\nWe are given the mass of the boson X:\n$$ m_X = 6 \\, \\text{GeV} $$\nSubstituting this into our kinematic condition, we get:\n$$ 6 \\, \\text{GeV} \\ge 2 m_f $$\n$$ \\implies m_f \\le 3 \\, \\text{GeV} $$\nThis means the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair $f\\bar{f}$ as long as the mass of the fermion $f$ is less than or equal to 3 GeV.\n\n### 4. Checking Fermion Masses\n\nNow, we need to check the masses of all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to see which ones satisfy this condition.\n\n**Lepton Masses:**\n*   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.000511 \\, \\text{GeV}$. This is $\\le 3$ GeV. **Allowed**.\n*   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 0.1057 \\, \\text{GeV}$. This is $\\le 3$ GeV. **Allowed**.\n*   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777 \\, \\text{GeV}$. This is $\\le 3$ GeV. **Allowed**.\n\n**Quark Masses:**\n*   Up ($u$): $m_u \\approx 0.0022 \\, \\text{GeV}$. This is $\\le 3$ GeV. **Allowed**.\n*   Down ($d$): $m_d \\approx 0.0047 \\, \\text{GeV}$. This is $\\le 3$ GeV. **Allowed**.\n*   Strange ($s$): $m_s \\approx 0.095 \\, \\text{GeV}$. This is $\\le 3$ GeV. **Allowed**.\n*   Charm ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\, \\text{GeV}$. This is $\\le 3$ GeV. **Allowed**.\n*   Bottom ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\, \\text{GeV}$. This is $> 3$ GeV. **Forbidden**. ($2m_b \\approx 8.36$ GeV > 6 GeV).\n*   Top ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173 \\, \\text{GeV}$. This is $> 3$ GeV. **Forbidden**.\n\nTherefore, the set of kinematically allowed decays into fermion-antifermion pairs is:\n$$ X \\rightarrow e^+e^-, \\, \\mu^+\\mu^-, \\, \\tau^+\\tau^-, \\, u\\bar{u}, \\, d\\bar{d}, \\, s\\bar{s}, \\, c\\bar{c} $$\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare this result with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This option includes the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$, which is kinematically forbidden.\n\n*   **B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This option includes the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$, which is kinematically forbidden.\n\n*   **C) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This option lists all the decays we identified as kinematically allowed. It does not contain any forbidden decays.\n\n*   **D) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This option includes the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$, which is kinematically forbidden. It also omits the allowed decays to $c\\bar{c}$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$.\n\nBased on the analysis, option C is the only one that correctly identifies the set of kinematically allowed decays.\n\n<<<C>>>"
