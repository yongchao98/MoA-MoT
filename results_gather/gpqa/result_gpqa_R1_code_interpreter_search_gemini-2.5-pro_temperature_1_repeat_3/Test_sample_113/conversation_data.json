    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction starts with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   `CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin.\n        *   `CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Reagent A must provide the proton (H⁺). The general representation for an acid in an aqueous solution is the hydronium ion, H₃O⁺. While the reaction is often buffered or performed by generating HCN in situ, H₃O⁺ correctly represents the necessary acidic workup or proton source. NaHSO₃ is incorrect as it would form a bisulfite addition product, which is a different reaction pathway.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This process is known as hydrolysis.\n    *   **Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating in the presence of a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   **Reagent B:** We need a reagent that can catalyze this hydrolysis in the presence of water.\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions.\n    *   Therefore, a strong acid like **B = HCl** is the suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, A is H₃O⁺ and B is HCl. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
