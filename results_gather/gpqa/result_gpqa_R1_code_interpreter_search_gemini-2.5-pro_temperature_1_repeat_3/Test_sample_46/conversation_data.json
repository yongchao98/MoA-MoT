    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure's features like rings or double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests one additional double bond (e.g., C=C or C=O) or a ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in the 3300-3500 cm-1 region is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The specific frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. This C=O group accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) means it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (3+1=4). This is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) next to a methyl group (-CH3-).\n        *   Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm, we can confidently identify an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n        *   The significant downfield shift of the CH2 group to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This suggests an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), likely as part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons in this region is very typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to exchange and quadrupolar effects of the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, as are the two on the other side. They split each other into doublets.\n        *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely due to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt).\n        *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is likely due to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Putting It All Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  Placing these groups at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Has a -CONH2 (amide) group, not an ester and a primary amine. The IR C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1660 cm-1). Incorrect.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (CH3CH2CO-), not the oxygen. The CH2 signal would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine (-NH2). The IR would show only one N-H band. Incorrect.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the data: C9H11NO2 formula, primary amine, conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
