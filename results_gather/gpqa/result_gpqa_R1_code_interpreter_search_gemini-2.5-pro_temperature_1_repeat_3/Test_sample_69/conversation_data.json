    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Decode the chemical identities from the clues.**\n\n*   **Clue 4: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"**\n    *   B and D are gases. Let's consider common gas-phase reactions that form solvents.\n    *   **Possibility 1:** SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l) (sulfuryl chloride). This is a 1:1 reaction and SO₂Cl₂ is a solvent. So, we could have {B,D} = {Cl₂, SO₂} and H = SO₂Cl₂.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l) (phosgene). This is 1:1. Phosgene is a solvent, though more known as a reagent/gas.\n    *   **Possibility 3:** C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l) (1,2-dichloroethane). This is a 1:1 reaction and dichloroethane is a common solvent. So, we could have {B,D} = {Cl₂, C₂H₄} and H = C₂H₄Cl₂.\n\n*   **Clue 3: \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"**\n    *   This is a hydrolysis reaction: C + H₂O → A + F + G.\n    *   The formation of an acid suggests C contains a non-metal or halogen. If B is Cl₂ (from possibilities 1 and 3), then C is a chloride. Hydrolysis of a chloride produces HCl, which is a strong acid. So, **F = HCl**.\n    *   The reaction also reforms A, the starting solid. This, combined with the formation of an acid G from the same element, points to a disproportionation reaction where the element from A, in an intermediate oxidation state in C, gets both reduced to its elemental form (A) and oxidized to form a weak acid (G).\n    *   A(in C) → A(s) + A(in G, a weak acid).\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"**\n    *   This high stoichiometry (1:8) is a strong hint. Let's test our possibilities for B.\n    *   If B = Cl₂, the reaction is A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C. Let's consider sulfur for A, as it forms weak oxyacids (like H₂SO₃). The elemental form of sulfur is a solid, commonly S₈.\n    *   Let's test the reaction: S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l).\n    *   This reaction is balanced. The molar ratio of reactant A (S₈) to reactant B (Cl₂) is 1:8. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Let's check the product C. C = SCl₂ (sulfur dichloride). It is described as a cherry-red liquid. \"Bright red product\" is a reasonable description.\n    *   Now let's verify the hydrolysis of C = SCl₂. The disproportionation reaction is: 2SCl₂ + 3H₂O → S(s) + H₂SO₃ + 4HCl.\n    *   This reaction produces elemental sulfur (A), sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃, a weak acid G), and hydrochloric acid (HCl, a strong acid F). This perfectly matches Clue 3.\n\n*   **So far, we have identified:**\n    *   **A** = S₈ (Sulfur)\n    *   **B** = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n    *   **C** = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n    *   **F** = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   **G** = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify D, H, and E.**\n    *   We established that B = Cl₂. Let's revisit the possibilities for D and H from Clue 4.\n    *   Possibility 1: D = SO₂, H = SO₂Cl₂.\n    *   Possibility 3: D = C₂H₄, H = C₂H₄Cl₂.\n    *   To decide, let's use **Clue 2: \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"**\n    *   Let's test Possibility 1: C + 2D → SCl₂ + 2SO₂ → E. The product of this reaction is not immediately obvious or famously hazardous.\n    *   Let's test Possibility 3: C + 2D → SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E. This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of **mustard gas**:\n        SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂\n    *   Mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, is an infamous chemical warfare agent and is certainly \"extremely hazardous\". The 1:2 stoichiometry of C to D also matches the clue.\n    *   This confirms our choice for D.\n\n*   **Final identification of all species:**\n    *   **A**: S₈ (Sulfur)\n    *   **B**: Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n    *   **C**: SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n    *   **D**: C₂H₄ (Ethene/Ethylene)\n    *   **E**: S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard gas)\n    *   **F**: HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   **G**: H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n    *   **H**: C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   The molecule is **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂** (mustard gas). The structure is Cl-CH₂-CH₂-S-CH₂-CH₂-Cl.\n*   This is a flexible molecule with rotation possible around the C-S and C-C bonds. To assign a point group, we typically consider the lowest-energy conformation or a representative high-symmetry conformation.\n*   Let's analyze the options provided:\n    *   **A) D∞h**: This is for linear molecules with a center of inversion, like CO₂. Mustard gas is not linear.\n    *   **B) D4h**: This is for square planar molecules, like XeF₄. Mustard gas is not square planar.\n    *   **C) C2v**: This group requires a C₂ axis and two mirror planes containing the axis (like water, H₂O). For mustard gas to have C2v symmetry, it would require a very strained, planar arrangement of its atoms, which is sterically unfavorable and not a low-energy conformation.\n    *   **D) C2**: This group requires only a single C₂ axis of rotation. It is possible for the mustard gas molecule to adopt a \"propeller-like\" conformation where the two -CH₂CH₂Cl arms are arranged such that a 180° rotation around an axis passing through the sulfur atom makes the molecule look identical. This conformation is known to be one of the low-energy conformers of mustard gas.\n\n*   Comparing the plausible options, a conformation with C₂ symmetry is far more sterically favorable than one with C2v symmetry. Given the choices, C₂ is the most appropriate molecular symmetry group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
