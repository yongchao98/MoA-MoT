    "This is a classic particle decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Principles:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial particle, the positive pion (Pi+), is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero. Due to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the product particles (muon mu+ and neutrino nu) must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   `p_initial = 0`\n    *   `p_final = p_mu + p_nu = 0`\n    *   Therefore, `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   `E_initial = m_pi * c²`\n    *   `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n    *   So, `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by `E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)²`.\n    *   For the muon: `E_mu² = (p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   For the neutrino, we assume it is massless (`m_nu = 0`), which is a standard approximation in this context. Therefore, its energy is given by `E_nu = p*c`.\n\n**2. Derivation:**\n\nWe can combine these equations to solve for the energies.\n\n1.  From energy conservation: `E_nu = m_pi*c² - E_mu`. Since `E_nu = pc`, we have `pc = m_pi*c² - E_mu`.\n2.  Substitute this `pc` into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n    `E_mu² = (m_pi*c² - E_mu)² + (m_mu*c²)²`\n3.  Expand the squared term:\n    `E_mu² = (m_pi*c²)² - 2*(m_pi*c²)*E_mu + E_mu² + (m_mu*c²)²`\n4.  The `E_mu²` terms cancel out. We can now solve for `E_mu`:\n    `2*(m_pi*c²)*E_mu = (m_pi*c²)² + (m_mu*c²)²`\n    `E_mu = [ (m_pi*c²)² + (m_mu*c²)² ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c² ]`\n\nThis gives us the total energy of the muon. The kinetic energy (`KE_mu`) is the total energy minus the rest energy: `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c²`.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (`KE_nu`) can be found from the total energy released (the Q-value of the reaction), which is the difference in the initial and final rest masses.\n`Q = KE_mu + KE_nu = (m_pi - m_mu - m_nu) * c²`\n`KE_nu = (m_pi*c² - m_mu*c²) - KE_mu`\n\n**3. Calculation:**\n\nLet's use the given values to compute the kinetic energies. We can use a python script for precise calculation.\n\n```python\n# Rest masses in MeV/c^2. We will use the energy equivalent in MeV for calculations.\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7   # MeV\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) using the derived formula.\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies.\n# We assume the neutrino is massless.\nQ_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# This Q-value is shared between the two product particles.\nKE_nu = Q_value - KE_mu\n\n# The problem asks for the KE of the product particles, mu(+) and nu.\n# The order in the options seems to be (KE_mu, KE_nu) or vice-versa.\n# Let's print both values.\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: 4.12 MeV\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: 29.78 MeV\n\nBased on the calculations, the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78). This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** This is a particle decay problem, which is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the particles can be relativistic, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The initial particle, the pion (Pi+), is stationary. Therefore, its initial momentum is zero (`p_initial = 0`).\n    *   According to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final system must also be zero. The final system consists of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu).\n    *   This means the muon and the neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n    *   `p_mu = p_nu = p`\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion: `E_initial = m_pi * c²`.\n    *   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   Therefore: `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`.\n\n4.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)²`.\n    *   For the muon (mu+): `E_mu² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`.\n    *   For the neutrino (nu): Neutrinos have a very small mass and are treated as massless in this context (`m_nu = 0`). Therefore, its energy-momentum relation simplifies to `E_nu = pc`.\n\n5.  **Solving the System of Equations:**\n    *   We have a system of equations:\n        a) `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`\n        b) `E_mu² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n        c) `E_nu = pc`\n    *   From (c), substitute `pc` with `E_nu` in equation (b):\n        `E_mu² = E_nu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   From (a), express `E_nu` in terms of `E_mu`: `E_nu = m_pi * c² - E_mu`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `E_nu` into the previous equation:\n        `E_mu² = (m_pi * c² - E_mu)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   Now, expand the squared term and solve for `E_mu`:\n        `E_mu² = (m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)E_mu + E_mu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   The `E_mu²` term on both sides cancels out:\n        `0 = (m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)E_mu + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `E_mu` (the total energy of the muon):\n        `2(m_pi * c²)E_mu = (m_pi * c²)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n        `E_mu = [ (m_pi * c²)² + (m_mu * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c²) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Now, we plug in the given values: `m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV` and `m_mu * c² = 105.7 MeV`.\n    *   `E_mu = [ (139.6)² + (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n    *   `E_mu = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    *   `E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV`\n    *   This is the total energy of the muon. The question asks for the **kinetic energy (KE)**.\n    *   `KE_mu = E_mu - (m_mu * c²) = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV`.\n\n7.  **Finding the Neutrino's Kinetic Energy:**\n    *   From the conservation of energy: `E_nu = m_pi * c² - E_mu`.\n    *   `E_nu = 139.6 MeV - 109.82 MeV = 29.78 MeV`.\n    *   Since the neutrino is considered massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy.\n    *   `KE_nu = E_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`.\n\n8.  **Final Result:**\n    *   The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is **4.12 MeV**.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is **29.8 MeV**.\n    *   This pair of values corresponds to option D.\n\nThe calculation was confirmed by the Python script execution in the previous step.\n\n<<<D>>>"
