    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations:\n\n**1. Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it's diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n\n*   Initial Concentration (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Concentration (M2) = ?\n\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer solution:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nWhere:\n*   pKa = -log(Ka)\n*   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate)\n*   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid)\n\nAt 25% titration, the ratio of [A⁻] to [HA] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n*   pH ≈ 4.256\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nFirst, we find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n*   Moles of acid = M_acid * V_acid = 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 moles\n*   Volume of NaOH = Moles / M_base = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\nNext, we find the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n*   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (acid solution) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\nNow, we calculate the pOH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n*   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n*   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n*   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nLet's perform the calculations with a higher precision to confirm.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_acid_conc = 0.05 # M\ninitial_acid_vol = 0.020 # L\nfinal_acid_vol = 0.040 # L\nbase_conc = 0.1 # M\n\n# Step 1: Concentration after dilution\ndiluted_acid_conc = (initial_acid_conc * initial_acid_vol) / final_acid_vol\n\n# Step 2: pH at 25% titration\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Step 3: pH at equivalence point\n# Moles of acid\nmoles_acid = diluted_acid_conc * final_acid_vol\n# Volume of base at equivalence point\nvol_base_eq = moles_acid / base_conc\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = final_acid_vol + vol_base_eq\n# Concentration of the conjugate base [A-]\nconc_A_minus = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n# Kb of the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-] from hydrolysis, where Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\n# pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\nThe pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\nFirst, the initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. We need to find the new concentration of the acetic acid solution before titration begins.\n\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   The new molarity (M₂) can be found using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n    M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the titration is performed on a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the strong base (NaOH) to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base.\n\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   At this point, the ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base to the weak acid is [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25/75 = 1/3.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissociates into Na⁺ and the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻). The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Step a: Find the moles of acid.**\n    Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n\n*   **Step b: Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n*   **Step c: Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point.**\n    Total Volume = Volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n*   **Step d: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.**\n    The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    Now, we set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis, where x = [OH⁻]:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n*   **Step e: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
