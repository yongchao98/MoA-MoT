    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid**\n\n*   **Starting material:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃).\n*   **Reagents:** Nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction type:** Electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration).\n*   The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing and activating group. Nitration of toluene yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the para isomer is the major product. In multi-step synthesis problems, we typically assume the major product is carried to the next step.\n*   **Product 1:** para-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Structure of Product 1:**\n```\n      CH₃\n      |\n     / \\\n    |   |\n   // \\\\\n  |     |\n   \\\\ //\n    |   |\n      |\n     NO₂\n```\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄**\n\n*   **Starting material:** Product 1 (para-nitrotoluene).\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction type:** Oxidation.\n*   MnO₂ in acidic medium is a strong oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing the alkyl side chain of a benzene ring to a carboxylic acid. The methyl group (-CH₃) is oxidized to a carboxyl group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO₂) is resistant to oxidation under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** para-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n**Structure of Product 2:**\n```\n      COOH\n      |\n     / \\\n    |   |\n   // \\\\\n  |     |\n   \\\\ //\n    |   |\n      |\n     NO₂\n```\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide**\n\n*   **Starting material:** Product 2 (para-nitrobenzoic acid).\n*   **Reagents:** Acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis of the reaction:**\n    1.  The first and most immediate reaction is an acid-base neutralization between the carboxylic acid and the strong base:\n        4-nitrobenzoic acid + NaOH → Sodium 4-nitrobenzoate + H₂O\n    2.  The subsequent reaction of sodium 4-nitrobenzoate with acetone is not a standard, high-yield reaction taught in introductory/intermediate organic chemistry. The aromatic ring is electron-poor, but lacks a good leaving group for Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (SNAr). Reactions involving the addition of the acetone enolate to the ring to form a Meisenheimer complex are possible but are typically intermediates and less favorable for mono-nitro compounds.\n    3.  There appears to be a high probability of a typo in the question. A very common and logical reaction involves treating **Product 1** (para-nitrotoluene), not Product 2, with acetone and NaOH. Let's proceed with this chemically plausible assumption, which is common for solving such problems.\n\n*   **Assumed Reaction:** Product 1 (para-nitrotoluene) + Acetone + aq. NaOH → Product 3.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group (-NO₂) makes the protons of the para-methyl group acidic.\n    2.  The strong base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the methyl group, forming a stabilized benzylic carbanion: [O₂N-C₆H₄-CH₂]⁻.\n    3.  This carbanion is a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of an acetone molecule.\n    4.  An alkoxide intermediate is formed: O₂N-C₆H₄-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-O⁻.\n    5.  This alkoxide is protonated by water (present in the aqueous solution) to yield the final product, a tertiary alcohol.\n*   **Product 3:** 1-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-methyl-2-propanol.\n\n**Structure of Product 3:**\n```\n          OH\n          |\n      O₂N-Ph-CH₂-C-CH₃\n          |\n          CH₃\n(where Ph is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring)\n```\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3**\n\nTo find the point group of 1-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-methyl-2-propanol, we look for its symmetry elements in its most stable conformation.\n\n1.  **Rotational Axes (Cₙ):** The molecule does not possess any C₂ or higher-order rotational axes. A C₂ axis passing through the nitro group and the benzene ring is negated by the asymmetry of the -CH₂-C(OH)(CH₃)₂ substituent.\n2.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule can adopt a conformation where it possesses a single plane of symmetry. This plane contains the nitro group, the benzene ring, the -CH₂- group, the tertiary carbon, and the -OH group. The two methyl (-CH₃) groups are situated as mirror images of each other across this plane.\n3.  **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of symmetry.\n4.  **Improper Rotation Axis (Sₙ):** The molecule does not have an improper rotation axis.\n\nSince the molecule's only symmetry element (other than the identity element E) is a single plane of symmetry (σ), its molecular symmetry group is **Cs**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) C₂h\nB) Cs\nC) D₂h\nD) C₃\n\nThe correct point group is Cs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
