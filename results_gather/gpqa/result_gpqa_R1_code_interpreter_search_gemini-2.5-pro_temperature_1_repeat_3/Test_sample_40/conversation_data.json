    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let **S** be the laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   Let **S'** be the rest frame of the glass. The glass is moving with a velocity **v** relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **v**: The velocity of the glass (frame S') with respect to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam.\n    *   **u'**: The velocity of the light beam with respect to the glass (frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **u**: The velocity of the light beam with respect to the laboratory (frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, when two velocities `u'` and `v` are in the same direction, the resultant velocity `u` as measured in the stationary frame is not a simple sum. Instead, it is given by the Lorentz velocity transformation formula:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We have the following values to substitute into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the algebraic expression:\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To get rid of the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can find a common denominator.\n    *   Numerator: `(1/n) + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n\n    `u = ( (1 + n*v) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n\n    The `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's compare this with the given options:\n    A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) 1\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n    Our result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
