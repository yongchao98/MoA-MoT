    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the chemical formula and structure of hydrocarbon Z.**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the chemical formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`, where Ar is the atomic mass.\n*   Using Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12: `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n*   The value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7. So, `1/7 = y / (12x + y)`.\n*   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general formula is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen and is formed by the hydrogenation of other compounds. This means Z must be a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* one substance, Z. This implies that all the compounds in mixtures X and Y share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   As we will see later, the reaction involves benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane (C6H12). This strongly suggests that the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring.\n*   Therefore, Z must be cyclohexane, C6H12. Let's check the mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane: `(12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437`, which is close enough to 14.28% considering rounding. The `y=2x` derivation is more definitive.\n*   Cyclohexane is also widely used as a solvent, which matches the description.\n\n**2. Determine the components of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. So, let C = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water, which is consistent.\n*   The other component, D, must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. This means D must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   D must not decolorize bromine water. This rules out unsaturated compounds like cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes. This leaves saturated or aromatic compounds.\n*   Since D must be different from C (cyclohexane), the only plausible candidate is an aromatic compound: benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**3. Determine the components of mixture X.**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. The reaction is described as a disproportionation.\n*   The overall transformation is: Mixture X → Mixture Y.\n*   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as: `A + B → C + D`\n*   Substituting the components of Y, we get: `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gains H) and another is dehydrogenated (loses H). The total number of C and H atoms must be conserved.\n*   Total atoms in products: C = 6+6=12, H = 12+6=18.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules A and B from mixture X must together contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms. Since they both have a C6 skeleton, their formulas must be C6Hx and C6Hy, where `x + y = 18`.\n*   Now let's use the properties of mixture X:\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B must contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, confirming the C6 ring skeleton for both A and B.\n*   Let's identify possible structures for A and B. They must be unsaturated C6 ring compounds.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Contains one double bond, not conjugated. It decolorizes bromine water. This is a possible candidate. (Number of H = 10).\n    *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Contains two double bonds, but they are conjugated. The problem statement explicitly excludes this.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Contains two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It decolorizes bromine water. This is a possible candidate. (Number of H = 8).\n*   Let's test the pair A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the requirement from the reaction stoichiometry.\n*   All other conditions are met: equimolar mixture of two C6-ring liquids, both decolorize bromine water, no conjugated bonds, and the reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` represents a valid hydrogen transfer.\n\n**4. Calculate the final answer.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene, C6H10) and one molecule of the second liquid (1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
