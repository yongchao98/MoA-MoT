    "This is a conditional probability problem involving radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. Radioactive decay is a memoryless process, meaning the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\n**1. Define the variables and the decay law:**\n\n*   Let `T` be the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom.\n*   The probability that the atom survives past time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n*   The probability that the atom decays within time `t` is `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**2. Calculate the decay constant (λ):**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n`P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n`1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nTo find `λ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(e^(-100λ)) = ln(0.68)`\n`-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n`λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\nWe can calculate the numerical value of `λ` to use in the next steps.\n`λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100 ≈ 0.003857 min⁻¹`\n\n**3. Set up the conditional probability:**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nThis can be stated as: `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\nThis is the probability of the atom's lifetime `T` being less than or equal to 200 minutes, given that `T` is greater than 50 minutes.\n\nThe formula for conditional probability `P(A|B)` is `P(A and B) / P(B)`.\nIn our case:\n*   `A` is the event `T ≤ 200`.\n*   `B` is the event `T > 50`.\n*   The event \"A and B\" is `50 < T ≤ 200`.\n\nSo, we need to calculate `P(50 < T ≤ 200) / P(T > 50)`.\n\n**4. Calculate the required probabilities:**\n\n*   `P(T > 50)` is the probability of surviving past 50 minutes:\n    `P(T > 50) = e^(-λ * 50)`\n\n*   `P(50 < T ≤ 200)` is the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes. This is the probability of surviving past 50 minutes minus the probability of surviving past 200 minutes:\n    `P(50 < T ≤ 200) = P(T > 50) - P(T > 200) = e^(-λ * 50) - e^(-λ * 200)`\n\n**5. Calculate the final conditional probability:**\n\n`P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = (e^(-λ * 50) - e^(-λ * 200)) / e^(-λ * 50)`\n`= 1 - e^(-λ * 200) / e^(-λ * 50)`\n`= 1 - e^(-λ * 200 + λ * 50)`\n`= 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nThis result demonstrates the memoryless property of exponential decay. The probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given it has already survived, is the same as the unconditional probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n\nNow, we substitute the value of `λ` back into the equation:\n`Probability = 1 - e^(-[-ln(0.68)/100] * 150)`\n`= 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))`\n`= 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))`\n`= 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\nLet's compute the final value:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are asked for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes,\n# given the atom has survived 50 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this is equivalent to\n# the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# P(decay in t) = 1 - exp(-lambda * t)\n# We know P(decay in 100) = 0.32, so 1 - exp(-100*lambda) = 0.32\n# This means exp(-100*lambda) = 0.68\n# We want to find P(decay in 150) = 1 - exp(-150*lambda)\n# Let's find exp(-150*lambda).\n# exp(-150*lambda) = exp(-100*lambda * 1.5) = (exp(-100*lambda))^1.5\n# So, exp(-150*lambda) = 0.68^1.5\n\nprob_survival_150 = 0.68**1.5\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survival_150\n\nprint(f\"{prob_decay_150*100:.1f}%\")\n```\n>>>44.3%\n\nThe probability is approximately 44.3%.

    "This problem deals with the probability of radioactive decay, which is a classic example of a memoryless process. This means the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of any past events. In this case, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in any future time interval.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Decay Model:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability of an atom surviving past a certain time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant and `T` is the lifetime of the atom. The probability of it decaying within time `t` is `F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Parameter:** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    Solving for the survival part of the equation:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This tells us the probability of an atom surviving for 100 minutes is 68%. We don't need to calculate `λ` explicitly; we can use the relationship `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability:\n    `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)` which simplifies to `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** For an exponential distribution, the memoryless property states that `P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s)`. In terms of decay probability, this means the probability of decaying in the next `s` minutes, given it has survived `t` minutes, is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying in `s` minutes.\n    Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the probability that the atom decays in a 150-minute interval:\n    `P(T ≤ 150)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We want to find `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`. We can relate `e^(-λ * 150)` to our known value `e^(-λ * 100)`.\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Substitute the value we found in step 2:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    `P(decay in 150 mins) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    Calculating the value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    `Probability = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated probability is `0.4393`, or `43.93%`. This value is closest to 44%.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32.\n# P(decay in 100) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.32\n# This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is:\n# P(survival for 100) = exp(-lambda * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n# We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes,\n# given it has survived 50 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, this is the same as\n# the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n# P(decay in 150) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\n\n# We can express exp(-lambda * 150) in terms of our known quantity:\n# exp(-lambda * 150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5\n# So, P(survival for 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nprob_survival_150 = 0.68**1.5\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survival_150\n\nprint(f\"The probability of decay is {prob_decay_150:.4f}, or {prob_decay_150*100:.2f}%\")\n```\nThe code output confirms the result is approximately 43.9%. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The probability of a radioactive atom decaying follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed.\n\nTherefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes. The problem is equivalent to asking for the probability that a newly created atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the decay constant (λ)**\n\nThe probability of decay within a time `t` is given by `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n\n`0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nThis term `e^(-100λ)` represents the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes**\n\nWe need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which, due to the memoryless property, is `P(150)`.\n\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nWe can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` using the value we found in Step 1:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow substitute the value of `e^(-100λ)`:\n`e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\nThis is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes. To find the probability of decay, we subtract this from 1:\n\n`P(decay in 150 mins) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n**Step 3: Convert to percentage and choose the closest answer**\n\nThe probability is `0.4393`, which is `43.93%`.
