    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy of the system is conserved. The system consists of the oscillating mass and the spring (or the potential field it creates). The total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n\n2.  **Write down the expressions for the energy components.**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. This energy includes the rest mass energy $mc^2$.\n    *   The potential energy of a spring obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) when stretched or compressed by a distance $x$ from its equilibrium position is $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system at any point in time is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy to two key points in the oscillation.**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n        At the maximum amplitude, the displacement is $x = A$. The mass momentarily comes to a stop, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total, A} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n        At the equilibrium position, the displacement is $x = 0$. The potential energy is zero, and the speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor takes its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total, 0} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the total energy at these two points.**\n    Since energy is conserved, $E_{total, A} = E_{total, 0}$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    First, let's solve for $\\gamma_{max}$. Divide the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange the terms to isolate the velocity term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find the final expression for $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression matches option B.\n\n    A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ - Incorrect.\n    B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ - Correct.\n    C) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ - This is the non-relativistic (classical) limit.\n    D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>"
