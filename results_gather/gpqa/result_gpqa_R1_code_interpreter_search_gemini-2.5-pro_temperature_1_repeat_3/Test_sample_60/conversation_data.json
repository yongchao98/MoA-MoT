    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the multi-step synthesis reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration).\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is known as \"mixed acid\". H2SO4 protonates HNO3, which then loses water to form the highly electrophilic nitronium ion (NO2+).\n*   **Mechanism:** The nitronium ion attacks the benzene ring, and after loss of a proton, nitrobenzene is formed.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 is nitrobenzene.\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2) and iron powder (Fe). The iron acts as a Lewis acid catalyst, reacting with Br2 to form FeBr3, which polarizes the Br2 molecule to create a strong electrophile (Br+).\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a powerful electron-withdrawing group. It strongly deactivates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution and directs incoming electrophiles to the **meta** position.\n*   **Product 2:** The bromine atom will add to the position meta to the nitro group. This results in **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene** (or m-bromonitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction).\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 is 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C). This is a standard method for reducing a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine group (-NH2). The aryl-halide bond (C-Br) is typically unaffected by these conditions.\n*   **Product 3:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **3-bromoaniline** (or m-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reaction:** Diazotization.\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 is 3-bromoaniline, a primary aromatic amine.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and fluoroboric acid (HBF4). The acid reacts with NaNO2 to form nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. The amine reacts with nitrous acid at low temperatures (0-5 °C) to form a diazonium salt. The use of HBF4 specifically forms the tetrafluoroborate salt.\n*   **Product 4:** **3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate** ([3-Br-C6H4-N2]+[BF4]−). This salt is a precursor for various reactions.\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.**\n*   **Reaction:** Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction (Aryl-Aryl Radical Coupling).\n*   **Reactants:** Product 4 (3-bromobenzenediazonium salt) and anisole (methoxybenzene).\n*   **Mechanism:** Heating the diazonium salt causes it to decompose, releasing nitrogen gas and forming a highly reactive aryl radical: the **3-bromophenyl radical** (•C6H4Br). This radical then attacks the anisole molecule.\n*   **Directing Effect:** Anisole has a methoxy group (-OCH3), which is a strong electron-donating group. It activates the ring and is an **ortho, para-director**. The incoming 3-bromophenyl radical will preferentially add to the ortho or para positions. Due to steric hindrance, the attack at the **para** position is favored and leads to the major product.\n*   **Final Product 5:** The 3-bromophenyl group attaches to the para position (C4) of the anisole ring. The resulting molecule is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\nLet's match this final product with the given options:\n*   **A) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl:** This matches our derived major product.\n*   B) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: This is incorrect because the initial bromination was meta, not para.\n*   C) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: This would be the minor product from ortho-attack on anisole.\n*   D) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl: This is incorrect as anisole does not contain fluorine.\n\nThe major product of the reaction sequence is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
