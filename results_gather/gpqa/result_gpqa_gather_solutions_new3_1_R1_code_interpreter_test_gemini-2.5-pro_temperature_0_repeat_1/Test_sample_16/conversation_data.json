Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is in equilibrium. The complex is formed from calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and the fully deprotonated form of EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The formation reaction is:\n\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, $K_f$ (also called the stability constant), which is given as $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\n$K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nSince we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, it's more convenient to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n\n$CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation, $K_d$, is the inverse of the formation constant:\n\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**2. Set up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. We are given that the initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, $[CaY^{2-}]$, is 0.02 M. We assume the initial concentrations of the free ions are zero.

Solve for the Unknown Concentration (x)**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the complex is very stable. This means the dissociation is very slight, and 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can make a simplifying approximation:\n\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-2})$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nTo find x, we take the square root:\n\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n**4. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated value, $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\n*   The problem involves a solution of a metal-ligand complex, specifically Calcium-EDTA ([CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule).\n*   This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n*   The equilibrium reaction for the *formation* of the complex is:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n*   The problem gives the formation constant (also called the stability constant) for this reaction:\n    K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Set up the Equilibrium Calculation**\n\n*   We are starting with a solution that contains 0.02 M of the complex [CaY]²⁻. This complex will slightly dissociate to reach equilibrium. Therefore, it is more convenient to consider the *dissociation* reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**3. Use an ICE Table**\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species       | [CaY]²⁻      | Ca²⁺         | Y⁴⁻          |\n|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M       | 0 M          | 0 M          |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x           | +x           | +x           |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x     | x            | x            |\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem states \"ideal pH\". This is a crucial simplification. The binding of EDTA is pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough so that all free EDTA exists as the Y⁴⁻ ion. This allows us to use the given K_f value directly without correcting for protonation of EDTA.\n\n**4. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x**\n\n*   The equilibrium expression for the dissociation reaction is:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n*   Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into this expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Because the dissociation constant K_d (2 x 10⁻¹¹) is extremely small, the equilibrium lies far to the left. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n*   We can make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the calculation significantly.\n*   The simplified equation is:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   Now, solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (2 x 10⁻²)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n*   Solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    To make the exponent even, we can write this as:\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n*   From our ICE table, the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n    [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**7. Verify the Assumption**\nIs x << 0.02?\n6.3 x 10⁻⁷ is much, much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2 x 10⁻²). The assumption was valid.\n\n**8. Conclusion**\nThe concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), for the reaction $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5.0 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table:** We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :----------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $CaY^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$    | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$     | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions we are looking for is 'x'.\n\n4.  **Solving for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5.0 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplifying Assumption:** The formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, which means the complex is very stable and only a tiny amount will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the assumption that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The equation simplifies to:\n    $5.0 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5.0 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x, which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option C. The code execution output confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nExcellent. The calculation was correct. Here is a summary of the solution.\n\nThe problem requires finding the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions ($[Ca^{2+}]$) from a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Dissociation Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) dissociates into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($Y^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The given constant is the formation constant ($K_f$), which is for the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Setting up the problem:** Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ at equilibrium. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of $Y^{4-}$ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the complex at equilibrium will be its initial concentration minus the amount that dissociated: $[CaY^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$.\n\n4.  **Applying the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Approximation:** Because $K_f$ is a very large number, the dissociation of the complex is minimal. This means 'x' will be very small compared to 0.02 M. We can therefore simplify the expression by assuming $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solving for x:**\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\, M$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ is the EDTA anion)\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) is given as:\nK_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are starting with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, [CaY]²⁻. This complex will dissociate into free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (Y⁴⁻). Let's denote the concentration of Ca²⁺ at equilibrium as 'x'. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of Y⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the remaining complex will be (0.02 - x).\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, meaning the amount of dissociation ('x') will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex.

It is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f.\nK_d = 1 / K_f\nK_d = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 0.2 x 10⁻¹⁰ = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**4. Set Up an ICE Table**\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Reaction      | [CaY]²⁻      | Ca²⁺ | Y⁴⁻  |\n|---------------|--------------|------|------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M       | 0 M  | 0 M  |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x           | +x   | +x   |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| (0.02 - x) M | x M  | x M  |\n\n**5. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x**\nNow, we use the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d, with the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table.\nK_d = ( [Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻] ) / [ [CaY]²⁻ ]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n**6. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small (2 x 10⁻¹¹). This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**7. Solve for x**\nRearrange the equation to solve for x²:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (2 x 10⁻²)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, take the square root to find x:\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nTo make the square root easier, we can write 4 x 10⁻¹³ as 40 x 10⁻¹⁴:\nx = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\nx = √40 * √(10⁻¹⁴)\nx ≈ 6.32 * 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**8. Final Conclusion**\nFrom the ICE table, 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.\n[Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\nThis value matches one of the options provided.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   **Dissociation vs. Formation:** The problem starts with the product (the complex), so the calculation must be based on the dissociation reaction.\n*   **K_d vs. K_f:** Remember to use the dissociation constant (K_d = 1/K_f) for the dissociation reaction.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This simplifies the problem significantly by allowing the direct use of K_f and assuming [Y⁴⁻] is the only form of free EDTA.\n*   **Validity of Approximation:** The calculated value of x (6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M) is much smaller than the initial concentration (0.02 M), confirming that the approximation (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) was valid.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The 1:1 dissociation means that at equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = [Y⁴⁻] = x.\n\nThe final calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Reaction and Formation Constant:**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Dissociation of the Complex:**\n\nSince we start with the complex, we need to consider its dissociation, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n**3. Dissociation Constant (K_d):**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f).\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**4. Equilibrium Calculation (ICE Table):**\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n**5. Solving for 'x':**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the dissociation constant (K_d) is extremely small, the amount of the complex that dissociates ('x') will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the denominator:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe analysis and code verification from the previous step have successfully identified the correct answer.\n\n**Summary of Verification:**\n\n1.  **Constraint Modeling:** The problem was modeled as a dissociation equilibrium: `CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻`. The key constraint was the dissociation constant, `Kd = 1 / Kf = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹`.\n2.  **Pruning:** The high stability of the complex (large Kf) allowed for the assumption that the dissociation `x` would be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This pruning step immediately pointed towards Candidate A as the only plausible option.\n3.  **Verification:** The Python code tested all candidates against the exact equilibrium equation `Kd = x² / (0.02 - x)`.\n    *   **Candidate A (6.3x10⁻⁷ M):** Produced a calculated `Kd` of `1.98x10⁻¹¹`, which is almost identical to the target `Kd` of `2.0x10⁻¹¹`. This is a pass.\n    *   **Candidates B, C, and D:** Produced `Kd` values that were orders of magnitude different from the target, confirming they are incorrect.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports Candidate A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer**: My initial assessment is that this is a straightforward equilibrium calculation. The reaction is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻. We are given the initial concentration of the complex and the formation constant (Kf). I can calculate the dissociation constant (Kd = 1/Kf) and then use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. The problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which I interpret to mean that we don't need to worry about the protonation of EDTA and can assume the given Kf is the conditional formation constant under these ideal conditions.\n\n**Skeptic**: Your approach seems sound, as this is a typical complexometric equilibrium problem. The \"ideal pH\" simplification is common in academic questions to avoid the more complex calculations involving alpha fractions of EDTA, which are pH-dependent. My main concern is to ensure the correct application of the equilibrium formula and the validity of any simplifying assumptions. Specifically, after setting up the equation Kd = x² / (0.02 - x), you will likely assume that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02. We must verify this assumption after solving for x to ensure the result is accurate.\n\n**Decision**: I will proceed with the calculation as proposed. The consensus is that this is a standard equilibrium problem where the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is the key process. I will calculate the dissociation constant, set up the equilibrium expression, solve for the calcium ion concentration, and then confirm that the simplifying assumption made during the calculation is valid.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Understand the equilibrium:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equation:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the dissociation constant (Kd):** The formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10¹⁰. The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:** Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n    *   Initial concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n    *   Initial concentration of Ca²⁺ = 0 M\n    *   Initial concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ = 0 M\n    *   At equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:**\n    Kd = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n    2x10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply a simplifying assumption:** Since Kd is very small, the dissociation is minimal, meaning x will be much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate x:**\n    x² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4x10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Verify the assumption:** The calculated value of x (6.32x10⁻⁷) is indeed significantly smaller than 0.02, so the approximation was valid.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex ([Ca-EDTA]²⁻). This complex exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Since we start with the complex, the relevant reaction to consider is its dissociation:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant:**\n    *   The problem provides the **formation constant (K_f)**, which corresponds to the reverse reaction: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻.\n        K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n    *   For the dissociation reaction, we need the **dissociation constant (K_d)**, which is the inverse of the formation constant.\n        K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form at equilibrium.\n    *   **Initial:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M; [Ca²⁺] = 0; [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0\n    *   **Change:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = -x; [Ca²⁺] = +x; [EDTA⁴⁻] = +x\n    *   **Equilibrium:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x; [Ca²⁺] = x; [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve:**\n    *   The expression for the dissociation constant is:\n        K_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n    *   Substitute the equilibrium concentrations:\n        2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n        2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply and Verify a Simplifying Assumption:**\n    *   Because K_d (2 x 10⁻¹¹) is extremely small, the complex is very stable, and very little of it will dissociate. This means 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can simplify the equation by assuming **(0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02**.\n    *   The simplified equation becomes:\n        2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   Now, solve for x:\n        x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n        x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n        x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n    *   **Verification:** The calculated value x ≈ 6.3x10⁻⁷ M is vastly smaller than 0.02 M, so the simplifying assumption was valid.\n\n6.  **Match the Result to the Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺] = x, is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    D) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated value matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Formation vs. Dissociation Constant:** It is crucial to use the correct equilibrium constant for the reaction being modeled. Since we are calculating the products of dissociation, using the dissociation constant (K_d = 1/K_f) is the most direct approach.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a key simplification. It means the pH is high enough (typically >10) that all free EDTA is in its fully deprotonated Y⁴⁻ form, allowing the direct use of the given K_f without needing to calculate a pH-dependent conditional formation constant.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The 1:1 dissociation of the complex means that at equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻]. This is why the numerator in the equilibrium expression becomes x².\n*   **Approximation Validity:** The assumption that x is negligible compared to the initial concentration must be mentally checked or explicitly verified to ensure the accuracy of the result. In this case, the very small K_d makes the assumption extremely safe.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Understand the Chemistry**\n\n*   The problem involves a solution of a metal-ligand complex, specifically Calcium-EDTA ([CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule).\n*   This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n*   The equilibrium reaction for the *formation* of the complex is:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n*   The problem gives the formation constant (also called the stability constant) for this reaction:\n    K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Set up the Equilibrium Calculation**\n\n*   We are starting with a solution that contains 0.02 M of the complex [CaY]²⁻. This complex will slightly dissociate to reach equilibrium. Therefore, it is more convenient to consider the *dissociation* reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**3.

This is a crucial simplification. The binding of EDTA is pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough so that all free EDTA exists as the Y⁴⁻ ion. This allows us to use the given K_f value directly without correcting for protonation of EDTA.\n\n**4. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x**\n\n*   The equilibrium expression for the dissociation reaction is:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n*   Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into this expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Because the dissociation constant K_d (2 x 10⁻¹¹) is extremely small, the equilibrium lies far to the left. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate.

Understand the Chemical System and Given Information**\n*   We are given a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The chemical formula for this complex is [CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule.\n*   The initial concentration of the complex is [CaY]²⁻_initial = 0.02 M.\n*   The formation constant (stability constant) for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n*   The problem states the pH is \"ideal\". This is a crucial piece of information. EDTA's ability to bind metal ions is pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough (typically pH > 10) so that virtually all free EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, Y⁴⁻. This allows us to use the given formation constant K_f directly without needing to calculate a conditional formation constant (K'_f).\n\n**2. Write the Relevant Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe formation of the complex is described by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant for this reaction is:\nK_f = [ [CaY]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻] ) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nSince we start with the complex, it will dissociate to a small extent to establish equilibrium. The relevant reaction to consider is the dissociation of the complex:\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**3.

Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small (2 x 10⁻¹¹). This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**7.

The key constraint was the dissociation constant, `Kd = 1 / Kf = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹`.\n2.  **Pruning:** The high stability of the complex (large Kf) allowed for the assumption that the dissociation `x` would be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.

The reaction is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻. We are given the initial concentration of the complex and the formation constant (Kf). I can calculate the dissociation constant (Kd = 1/Kf) and then use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. The problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which I interpret to mean that we don't need to worry about the protonation of EDTA and can assume the given Kf is the conditional formation constant under these ideal conditions.\n\n**Skeptic**: Your approach seems sound, as this is a typical complexometric equilibrium problem. The \"ideal pH\" simplification is common in academic questions to avoid the more complex calculations involving alpha fractions of EDTA, which are pH-dependent. My main concern is to ensure the correct application of the equilibrium formula and the validity of any simplifying assumptions. Specifically, after setting up the equation Kd = x² / (0.02 - x), you will likely assume that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02. We must verify this assumption after solving for x to ensure the result is accurate.\n\n**Decision**: I will proceed with the calculation as proposed. The consensus is that this is a standard equilibrium problem where the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is the key process. I will calculate the dissociation constant, set up the equilibrium expression, solve for the calcium ion concentration, and then confirm that the simplifying assumption made during the calculation is valid.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Understand the equilibrium:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equation:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the dissociation constant (Kd):** The formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10¹⁰. The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:** Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n    *   Initial concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n    *   Initial concentration of Ca²⁺ = 0 M\n    *   Initial concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ = 0 M\n    *   At equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:**\n    Kd = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n    2x10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply a simplifying assumption:** Since Kd is very small, the dissociation is minimal, meaning x will be much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate x:**\n    x² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4x10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Verify the assumption:** The calculated value of x (6.32x10⁻⁷) is indeed significantly smaller than 0.02, so the approximation was valid.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.
