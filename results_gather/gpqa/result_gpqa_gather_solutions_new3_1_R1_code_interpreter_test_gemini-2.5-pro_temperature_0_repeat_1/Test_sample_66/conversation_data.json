We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalues `-ħ` for both. This corresponds to the measurement outcome where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `m = m1 + m2`\n\n4.  **Applying the Conservation Rule**:\n    *   In the given initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome has `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n    *   If this outcome were to occur, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: There is a contradiction. The initial state has a total `m` of -1, while the desired measurement outcome corresponds to a total `m` of -2. The conservation of the z-component of angular momentum dictates that a state with `m = -1` cannot yield a measurement result where the sum of the components is `m1 + m2 = -2`.\n\nThe probability of an event that violates a conservation law is zero. The coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|m1, m2>` for which `m1 + m2 = -1`. The state `|m1=-1, m2=-1>` is not part of this combination. Therefore, the probability of measuring `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` is 0.\n\nThis can also be formally shown using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which give the expansion of a coupled state in terms of uncoupled states. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l1, m1, l2, m2 | l, m>` is zero unless `m = m1 + m2`. In this case, the probability is the square of the coefficient `<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>`, which is zero because `-1 + (-1) ≠ -1`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nIn quantum mechanics, when coupling angular momenta, the total magnetic quantum number *m* must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, *m* = *m*<sub>l1</sub> + *m*<sub>l2</sub>. This is a fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are the expansion coefficients used to express a coupled angular momentum state in terms of the uncoupled states. If this condition is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by |*l*<sub>1</sub>, *l*<sub>2</sub>, *l*, *m*> = |1, 1, 2, -1>.\n*   We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both L<sub>1z</sub> and L<sub>2z</sub> as -ħ.\n\nThe eigenvalue of the L<sub>z</sub> operator is *m*<sub>l</sub>ħ. Therefore, measuring the eigenvalues of L<sub>1z</sub> and L<sub>2z</sub> as -ħ corresponds to finding the system in a state where *m*<sub>l1</sub> = -1 and *m*<sub>l2</sub> = -1.\n\nLet's check the selection rule:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number of the given state is *m* = -1.\n*   The sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome is *m*<sub>l1</sub> + *m*<sub>l2</sub> = (-1) + (-1) = -2.\n\nSince *m* ≠ *m*<sub>l1</sub> + *m*<sub>l2</sub> (-1 ≠ -2), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these states is zero. The probability of a measurement is the square of the absolute value of this coefficient. Consequently, the probability of measuring *m*<sub>l1</sub> = -1 and *m*<sub>l2</sub> = -1 is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   This state is an eigenstate of the total orbital angular momentum operator $L^2$ and its z-component $L_z$.\n    *   The quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum is $m = -1$.\n    *   The measurement being performed is on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n2.  **Relate the total and individual angular momentum components:**\n    *   The total z-component of the angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The corresponding quantum numbers are related by the sum: $m = m_1 + m_2$. Here, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for electron 1 and electron 2, respectively.\n\n3.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The given state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   This means that if we were to measure the total z-component of angular momentum, we would get the value $-1\\hbar$ with 100% certainty.\n\n4.  **Analyze the desired measurement outcome:**\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. For the eigenvalue to be $-\\hbar$, we must have $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. For the eigenvalue to be $-\\hbar$, we must have $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   So, we are looking for the probability of the outcome where $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n5.  **Apply the conservation principle (selection rule):**\n    *   For any possible outcome of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, the sum of the quantum numbers $m_1 + m_2$ must equal the total magnetic quantum number $m$ of the initial state.\n    *   In our case, the initial state has $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired outcome has $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum for the desired outcome: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since the sum for the desired outcome ($m_1+m_2 = -2$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m = -1$), this outcome is forbidden.\n\n6.  **Formal Calculation using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    *   The probability of measuring the state to be in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ is given by the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n        $P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$\n    *   We want to find the probability for $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n        $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n    *   A fundamental property (selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   Here, $m = -1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nConclusion: The measurement outcome where both electrons have a z-component of angular momentum of $-\\hbar$ is physically impossible for a system in the state $|l=2, m=-1>$. The probability of this event is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The system consists of two electrons, both in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   The system is described in the coupled basis, where the individual angular momenta are combined to form a total angular momentum.\n    *   The specific state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and the Final State:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   This measurement projects the system onto the uncoupled basis, which is represented by kets of the form $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$.\n    *   The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$, so getting $-\\hbar$ means $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$, so getting $-\\hbar$ means $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the specific final state we are interested in is $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   A crucial principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   This is expressed by the relation: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   This relation must hold for any component of the coupled state when expressed in the uncoupled basis. In other words, a coupled state $|l, m>$ is a linear combination of only those uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ for which $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n4.  **Compare the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   For the **initial state** $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, the total z-component quantum number is $m_{initial} = -1$.\n    *   For the **desired final state** $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers is $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   The probability of finding the system in the final state after the measurement is the squared magnitude of the inner product (projection) of the initial state onto the final state.\n    *   Probability $P = |< \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} >|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n    *   The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   In our case, $m = -1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    *   $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m>$) and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2>$). The connection between them is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **Conservation of $m$:** The most direct way to solve this problem is to recognize the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$. Since these eigenvalues are different, the states are orthogonal, and the probability of transitioning from one to the other upon measurement is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** A measurement cannot change the value of a conserved quantity. Since the system is in a state with a definite total z-angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$, any measurement of the individual components must yield a pair $(m_1, m_2)$ such that their sum is $-1$. The outcome $(m_1=-1, m_2=-1)$ has a sum of $-2$, which is physically impossible for this initial state.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum quantum number $m = -1$. The measurement outcome being considered corresponds to a state with individual quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, which gives a total z-component quantum number of $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since the total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved ($m_{initial} = m_{final}$), the probability of this outcome is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system.**\n    The system consists of two electrons, and its coupled angular momentum state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    This means:\n    *   Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1: $l_1 = 1$.\n    *   Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2: $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system: $l = 2$.\n    *   The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum: $m = -1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the state corresponding to the measurement outcome.**\n    We are measuring the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This measurement outcome corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$. For simplicity, we can denote this state as $|m_1, m_2> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Relate the initial and final states using the principles of quantum mechanics.**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|-1, -1>$ when it is initially in the state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |<m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1>|^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. The corresponding quantum numbers are related by:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n5.  **Check if this condition is satisfied.**\n    *   For the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the final measured state $|-1, -1>$, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    We see that the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the final state ($m_1+m_2 = -2$).\n\n6.  **Draw the conclusion.**\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$. This is known as the Clebsch-Gordan expansion:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1 m_2 m}^{l_1 l_2 l} |m_1, m_2>$\n    A crucial rule for this expansion is that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $C_{m_1 m_2 m}^{l_1 l_2 l}$ are zero unless $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n    In our case, the inner product $<m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1>$ is precisely the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $C_{-1, -1, -1}^{1, 1, 2}$. Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m = -1$, this coefficient is zero.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the concept of orthogonality of eigenstates.\n    *   The initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state $|-1, -1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n    *   Since these two states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) but have different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar \\neq -2\\hbar$), they must be orthogonal.\n    *   Therefore, their inner product is zero: $<m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1> = 0$.\n\n    The probability is the square of this inner product:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThus, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a problem in quantum mechanics concerning the addition of angular momentum. I will determine the probability by projecting the given coupled state onto the desired uncoupled measurement state.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Identify the initial state (coupled basis) and the final state (uncoupled basis) from the problem description.\n    2.  The probability is the square of the magnitude of the inner product of these two states. This inner product is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    3.  Apply the selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which states that the coefficient is zero unless the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly ($m = m_1 + m_2$).\n    4.  Calculate the probability based on the selection rule.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  **Initial State:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. Here, the total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and its z-component is $m=-1$.\n    2.  **Final State:** A measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed. We want the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to the quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The state for this measurement outcome, in the uncoupled basis, is $|\\psi_{final}> = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n    3.  **Probability Calculation:** The probability $P$ is given by the squared modulus of the amplitude to find the system in the final state, given it started in the initial state:\n        $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n    4.  **Apply Selection Rule:** The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental property (selection rule) of these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n        Let's check this condition with the given quantum numbers:\n        -   From the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$, we have $m = -1$.\n        -   From the final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n        -   The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n        -   The condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ becomes $-1 = -2$, which is false.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$\n    Therefore, the probability is $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\nThis result has a clear physical interpretation. The initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. Any measurement of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ must yield eigenvalues $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$ such that their sum is equal to the total, i.e., $m_1 + m_2 = m$. In this case, the desired measurement outcome has $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum for the given initial state. Thus, such an outcome is impossible.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nIn the quantum mechanical coupling of angular momenta, a coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle$. The coefficients of this expansion are known as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, denoted by $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$.\n\nThe expansion is given by the formula:\n$|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n\nA fundamental property and a selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers of the individual angular momenta sum up to the total magnetic quantum number. That is, the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ must be satisfied. If this condition is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n\nIn the given problem, we have two electrons in a p orbital, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The coupled state of the two-electron system is given as $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, which means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and the total magnetic quantum number is $m=-1$.\n\nWe are asked to find the joint probability of measuring the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ and obtaining the eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both. The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m_l\\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of $m_l = -1$.\n\nThis means we are looking for the probability of finding the first electron in the state with $m_1 = -1$ and the second electron in the state with $m_2 = -1$. The corresponding uncoupled state is $|l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle$.\n\nThe probability of this measurement outcome is the square of the absolute value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$.\n\nLet's check the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ for this coefficient.\nHere, $m_1 = -1$, $m_2 = -1$, and $m = -1$.\nSo, $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\nSince $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of the state $|1, -1\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle$ in the expansion of the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is zero. The probability of measuring the system to be in this state is the square of this coefficient, which is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, of two electrons and obtaining the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both.\n\nThe state of the 2-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p orbitals). The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for its z-component is $m=-1$.\n\nTo find the probability of a specific outcome for measurements of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, we need to express the given coupled state in the uncoupled basis, which is denoted by $|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle$. The probability of measuring the eigenvalues $m_1\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and $m_2\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the system's state onto the corresponding uncoupled state.\n\nThe transformation between the coupled and uncoupled bases is defined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state can be written as a linear combination of uncoupled states:\n$|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n\nWe are interested in the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$. This corresponds to the final state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The probability is given by:\n$P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$, is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- The total magnetic quantum number of the coupled state: $m = -1$.\n- The individual magnetic quantum numbers of the desired measurement outcome: $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nLet's check the sum:\n$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ is not equal to $m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding the system in the state with $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is:\n$P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis means it is impossible to measure the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for both electrons to be $-\\hbar$ when the total system is in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, to both be `-ħ`. This corresponds to finding the system in the state where the magnetic quantum numbers are `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nThe initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as `|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. In this notation:\n*   `l_1 = 1` and `l_2 = 1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons (since they are in p orbitals).\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the magnetic quantum number for the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nA measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum (`L_1z` and `L_2z`) projects the coupled state onto the uncoupled basis, which is represented by `|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2>`.\n\nThe probability of finding the system in a specific uncoupled state `|1, m_1, 1, m_2>` after the measurement is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the initial and final states:\n`P(m_1, m_2) = |<1, m_1, 1, m_2 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2`\n\nThe term `<1, m_1, 1, m_2 | 1, 1, 2, -1>` is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients are essentially the expansion coefficients when a state in the coupled basis is written as a linear combination of states in the uncoupled basis.\n\nA fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers add up, i.e., `m = m_1 + m_2`.\n\nIn this problem, we are interested in the outcome where `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`. Let's check if this satisfies the selection rule with the given total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n\n`m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince `m = -1` and `m_1 + m_2 = -2`, the condition `m = m_1 + m_2` is not met. This means the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this specific transition is zero:\n`<1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0`\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring `L_1z = -ħ` (which corresponds to `m_1 = -1`) and `L_2z = -ħ` (which corresponds to `m_2 = -1`) is:\n`P(-1, -1) = |0|^2 = 0`\n\nThis result is physically intuitive. The z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components (`L_z = L_1z + L_2z`). If the system is in a state with a total z-component eigenvalue of `-ħ` (since `m=-1`), it is impossible to find it in a state where the sum of the individual components is `-2ħ` (from `m_1=-1` and `m_2=-1`), as this would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during the measurement projection.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe total angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is given by $|l, m> = |2, -1>$. This means the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$) is $m = -1$.\n\nThe total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components of the two electrons:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis relationship also holds for their corresponding magnetic quantum numbers:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\nAn eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\nAn eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nIf this measurement were to occur, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nHowever, the system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number is known to be $m = -1$. Since the sum of the measured components ($m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system ($m = -1$), this outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nTherefore, the event is impossible, and its probability is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe initial analysis is confirmed by the search results. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which give the expansion of a coupled angular momentum state in terms of the uncoupled states, are non-zero only when the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly.\n\nSpecifically, the coefficient `<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>` is zero unless `m1 + m2 = m`.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>`. We want to find the probability of measuring the system to be in the uncoupled state corresponding to `L1z = -ħ` and `L2z = -ħ`. This means we are looking for the state where `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\nFor the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>` to be non-zero, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers must equal the total magnetic quantum number.\nHere, `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\nThe total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\nSince `-2 ≠ -1`, the condition is not met.\n\nTherefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0. The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is also 0. This means it is impossible to measure `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` simultaneously if the system is in the state `|l=2, m=-1>`.\n\nThe state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of the states `|m1=0, m2=-1>` and `|m1=-1, m2=0>`. The probability of measuring `m1=-1` and `m2=-1` is the squared modulus of the amplitude of the state `|m1=-1, m2=-1>` in the expansion of `|l=2, m=-1>`. As established, this amplitude is zero.\n\nFinal Answer is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe initial state of the two-electron system is the coupled angular momentum state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This state is a superposition of the uncoupled basis states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for the individual electrons.\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. This is expressed by the selection rule:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThis rule acts as a powerful constraint. For any component $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ to be part of the superposition that forms $|l, m\\rangle$, the sum of its individual magnetic quantum numbers must equal the total magnetic quantum number. If this condition is not met, the amplitude (and thus the probability) of finding the system in that component state is zero.\n\nIn this problem:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n*   The measurement is for the outcome where the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are both $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the uncoupled state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nLet's apply the constraint:\n*   Sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the target outcome: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n*   Compare this sum to the total magnetic quantum number of the system: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n\nSince $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$, the state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is not a constituent of the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\nThe probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n$P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nBecause the selection rule $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, leading to a probability of zero.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe analysis is confirmed. The measurement of individual z-components of angular momentum, $m_1$ and $m_2$, must satisfy the conservation law $m_1 + m_2 = m$, where $m$ is the total magnetic quantum number of the system.\n\n*   **System State:** The system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$, so the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   **Target Measurement:** The question asks for the probability of measuring eigenvalues corresponding to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   **Verification:** The sum of the target measurement outcomes is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the sum of the individual components ($-2$) does not equal the total component of the system ($-1$), this measurement outcome is forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics. The probability of such an event is exactly zero.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer**: The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of `L_1z` and `L_2z` to both be `-ħ`. This corresponds to measuring the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` to be `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nThe system is in a coupled angular momentum state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. The total magnetic quantum number `m` is the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2`. This is because the operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}`.\n\nTherefore, for any possible measurement outcome `(m_1, m_2)`, the condition `m = m_1 + m_2` must be satisfied.\n\nIn this problem, the state of the system has `m = -1`. The desired measurement outcome is `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\nLet's check if the condition is met: `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\nSince the required sum `(-2)` does not equal the system's total magnetic quantum number `(-1)`, it is impossible to obtain this measurement result.\n\nThus, the probability of this event is 0. I will perform a search to confirm the fundamental principle `m = m1 + m2` in the context of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n**Skeptic**: The Proposer's argument is based on the selection rule `m = m_1 + m_2`. The search results confirm this. Specifically, result states that Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which govern the transformation between uncoupled `|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>` and coupled `|l, m>` states, are non-zero only when `m = m_1 + m_2`. Result also explicitly states, \"It follows that m = m1 +m2\". Result shows how the z-component of the total angular momentum operator `J_z` acts on an uncoupled state: `J_z|j1,m1,j2,m2> = (J_1z + J_2z)|j1,m1,j2,m2> = ħ(m1 + m2)|j1,m1,j2,m2>`. This confirms that the eigenvalue of the total z-component is the sum of the individual eigenvalues.\n\nThe problem specifies the total state as `|l=2, m=-1>` and asks for the probability of measuring the individual states corresponding to `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\nThe sum `m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\nThe total `m` is `-1`.\nSince `m_1 + m_2 ≠ m`, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>` is zero. The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is also zero. The logic is sound and well-supported by fundamental principles of quantum mechanics confirmed in the search.\n\n**Decision**: The debate converges. The initial reasoning was correct and is strongly supported by the search results. The probability is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is described by the coupled angular momentum state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This tells us the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   Crucially, the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $L_{z}$ operator is $m_l\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   Operator relation: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   Quantum number relation: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency (The Selection Rule):** For a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ to have a non-zero probability of being measured as the uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, the quantum numbers must satisfy the relation $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   From the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired measurement outcome, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum for the outcome: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) is not equal to the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state ($m_1+m_2 = -2$). This violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n    The probability of this measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero. Therefore, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is set up to test the understanding of the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The initial state is given in the coupled basis, while the measurement is performed in the uncoupled basis.\n*   **Conservation Law as a Shortcut:** The most direct path to the solution is recognizing the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. A system in an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$ cannot be found in a state that is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with a different eigenvalue (in this case, $-2\\hbar$). Since the states are orthogonal, the transition probability is zero.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** A vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the core reasoning: the sum $m_1+m_2$ must equal $m$. They correctly calculate $m_1+m_2 = -2$ and note that this is not equal to $m=-1$, leading to a probability of 0. However, many of them inexplicably select the wrong final letter (e.g., A, B, or D). The reasoning is sound across the board, and that reasoning points unequivocally to 0.\n\nThe joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.

We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalues `-ħ` for both. This corresponds to the measurement outcome where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `m = m1 + m2`\n\n4.  **Applying the Conservation Rule**:\n    *   In the given initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome has `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n    *   If this outcome were to occur, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: There is a contradiction. The initial state has a total `m` of -1, while the desired measurement outcome corresponds to a total `m` of -2. The conservation of the z-component of angular momentum dictates that a state with `m = -1` cannot yield a measurement result where the sum of the components is `m1 + m2 = -2`.\n\nThe probability of an event that violates a conservation law is zero. The coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|m1, m2>` for which `m1 + m2 = -1`. The state `|m1=-1, m2=-1>` is not part of this combination. Therefore, the probability of measuring `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` is 0.\n\nThis can also be formally shown using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which give the expansion of a coupled state in terms of uncoupled states. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l1, m1, l2, m2 | l, m>` is zero unless `m = m1 + m2`. In this case, the probability is the square of the coefficient `<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>`, which is zero because `-1 + (-1) ≠ -1`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nIn quantum mechanics, when coupling angular momenta, the total magnetic quantum number *m* must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, *m* = *m*<sub>l1</sub> + *m*<sub>l2</sub>.

This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   The system is described in the coupled basis, where the individual angular momenta are combined to form a total angular momentum.\n    *   The specific state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and the Final State:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   This measurement projects the system onto the uncoupled basis, which is represented by kets of the form $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$.\n    *   The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$, so getting $-\\hbar$ means $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$, so getting $-\\hbar$ means $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the specific final state we are interested in is $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   A crucial principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   This is expressed by the relation: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   This relation must hold for any component of the coupled state when expressed in the uncoupled basis. In other words, a coupled state $|l, m>$ is a linear combination of only those uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ for which $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n4.  **Compare the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   For the **initial state** $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, the total z-component quantum number is $m_{initial} = -1$.\n    *   For the **desired final state** $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers is $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   The probability of finding the system in the final state after the measurement is the squared magnitude of the inner product (projection) of the initial state onto the final state.\n    *   Probability $P = |< \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} >|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n    *   The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   In our case, $m = -1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    *   $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m>$) and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2>$). The connection between them is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **Conservation of $m$:** The most direct way to solve this problem is to recognize the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$. Since these eigenvalues are different, the states are orthogonal, and the probability of transitioning from one to the other upon measurement is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** A measurement cannot change the value of a conserved quantity. Since the system is in a state with a definite total z-angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$, any measurement of the individual components must yield a pair $(m_1, m_2)$ such that their sum is $-1$. The outcome $(m_1=-1, m_2=-1)$ has a sum of $-2$, which is physically impossible for this initial state.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum quantum number $m = -1$. The measurement outcome being considered corresponds to a state with individual quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, which gives a total z-component quantum number of $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since the total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved ($m_{initial} = m_{final}$), the probability of this outcome is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system.**\n    The system consists of two electrons, and its coupled angular momentum state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    This means:\n    *   Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1: $l_1 = 1$.\n    *   Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2: $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system: $l = 2$.\n    *   The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum: $m = -1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the state corresponding to the measurement outcome.**\n    We are measuring the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This measurement outcome corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$. For simplicity, we can denote this state as $|m_1, m_2> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Relate the initial and final states using the principles of quantum mechanics.**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|-1, -1>$ when it is initially in the state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |<m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1>|^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. The corresponding quantum numbers are related by:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n5.  **Check if this condition is satisfied.**\n    *   For the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the final measured state $|-1, -1>$, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    We see that the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the final state ($m_1+m_2 = -2$).\n\n6.  **Draw the conclusion.**\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$. This is known as the Clebsch-Gordan expansion:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1 m_2 m}^{l_1 l_2 l} |m_1, m_2>$\n    A crucial rule for this expansion is that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $C_{m_1 m_2 m}^{l_1 l_2 l}$ are zero unless $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n    In our case, the inner product $<m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1>$ is precisely the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $C_{-1, -1, -1}^{1, 1, 2}$. Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m = -1$, this coefficient is zero.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the concept of orthogonality of eigenstates.\n    *   The initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state $|-1, -1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n    *   Since these two states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) but have different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar \\neq -2\\hbar$), they must be orthogonal.\n    *   Therefore, their inner product is zero: $<m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1> = 0$.\n\n    The probability is the square of this inner product:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThus, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a problem in quantum mechanics concerning the addition of angular momentum. I will determine the probability by projecting the given coupled state onto the desired uncoupled measurement state.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Identify the initial state (coupled basis) and the final state (uncoupled basis) from the problem description.\n    2.  The probability is the square of the magnitude of the inner product of these two states. This inner product is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    3.  Apply the selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which states that the coefficient is zero unless the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly ($m = m_1 + m_2$).\n    4.  Calculate the probability based on the selection rule.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  **Initial State:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. Here, the total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and its z-component is $m=-1$.\n    2.  **Final State:** A measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed. We want the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to the quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The state for this measurement outcome, in the uncoupled basis, is $|\\psi_{final}> = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n    3.  **Probability Calculation:** The probability $P$ is given by the squared modulus of the amplitude to find the system in the final state, given it started in the initial state:\n        $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n    4.  **Apply Selection Rule:** The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental property (selection rule) of these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n        Let's check this condition with the given quantum numbers:\n        -   From the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$, we have $m = -1$.\n        -   From the final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n        -   The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n        -   The condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ becomes $-1 = -2$, which is false.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$\n    Therefore, the probability is $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\nThis result has a clear physical interpretation. The initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. Any measurement of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ must yield eigenvalues $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$ such that their sum is equal to the total, i.e., $m_1 + m_2 = m$. In this case, the desired measurement outcome has $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum for the given initial state. Thus, such an outcome is impossible.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nIn the quantum mechanical coupling of angular momenta, a coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle$. The coefficients of this expansion are known as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, denoted by $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$.\n\nThe expansion is given by the formula:\n$|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n\nA fundamental property and a selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers of the individual angular momenta sum up to the total magnetic quantum number. That is, the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ must be satisfied. If this condition is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n\nIn the given problem, we have two electrons in a p orbital, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The coupled state of the two-electron system is given as $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, which means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and the total magnetic quantum number is $m=-1$.\n\nWe are asked to find the joint probability of measuring the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ and obtaining the eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both. The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m_l\\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of $m_l = -1$.\n\nThis means we are looking for the probability of finding the first electron in the state with $m_1 = -1$ and the second electron in the state with $m_2 = -1$. The corresponding uncoupled state is $|l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle$.\n\nThe probability of this measurement outcome is the square of the absolute value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$.\n\nLet's check the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ for this coefficient.\nHere, $m_1 = -1$, $m_2 = -1$, and $m = -1$.\nSo, $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\nSince $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of the state $|1, -1\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle$ in the expansion of the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is zero. The probability of measuring the system to be in this state is the square of this coefficient, which is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, of two electrons and obtaining the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both.\n\nThe state of the 2-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p orbitals). The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for its z-component is $m=-1$.\n\nTo find the probability of a specific outcome for measurements of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, we need to express the given coupled state in the uncoupled basis, which is denoted by $|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle$. The probability of measuring the eigenvalues $m_1\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and $m_2\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the system's state onto the corresponding uncoupled state.\n\nThe transformation between the coupled and uncoupled bases is defined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state can be written as a linear combination of uncoupled states:\n$|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n\nWe are interested in the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$. This corresponds to the final state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The probability is given by:\n$P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$, is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- The total magnetic quantum number of the coupled state: $m = -1$.\n- The individual magnetic quantum numbers of the desired measurement outcome: $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nLet's check the sum:\n$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ is not equal to $m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding the system in the state with $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is:\n$P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis means it is impossible to measure the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for both electrons to be $-\\hbar$ when the total system is in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, to both be `-ħ`. This corresponds to finding the system in the state where the magnetic quantum numbers are `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nThe initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as `|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. In this notation:\n*   `l_1 = 1` and `l_2 = 1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons (since they are in p orbitals).\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the magnetic quantum number for the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nA measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum (`L_1z` and `L_2z`) projects the coupled state onto the uncoupled basis, which is represented by `|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2>`.\n\nThe probability of finding the system in a specific uncoupled state `|1, m_1, 1, m_2>` after the measurement is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the initial and final states:\n`P(m_1, m_2) = |<1, m_1, 1, m_2 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2`\n\nThe term `<1, m_1, 1, m_2 | 1, 1, 2, -1>` is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients are essentially the expansion coefficients when a state in the coupled basis is written as a linear combination of states in the uncoupled basis.\n\nA fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers add up, i.e., `m = m_1 + m_2`.\n\nIn this problem, we are interested in the outcome where `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`. Let's check if this satisfies the selection rule with the given total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n\n`m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince `m = -1` and `m_1 + m_2 = -2`, the condition `m = m_1 + m_2` is not met. This means the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this specific transition is zero:\n`<1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0`\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring `L_1z = -ħ` (which corresponds to `m_1 = -1`) and `L_2z = -ħ` (which corresponds to `m_2 = -1`) is:\n`P(-1, -1) = |0|^2 = 0`\n\nThis result is physically intuitive. The z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components (`L_z = L_1z + L_2z`). If the system is in a state with a total z-component eigenvalue of `-ħ` (since `m=-1`), it is impossible to find it in a state where the sum of the individual components is `-2ħ` (from `m_1=-1` and `m_2=-1`), as this would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during the measurement projection.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe total angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is given by $|l, m> = |2, -1>$.

Since the sum of the measured components ($m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system ($m = -1$), this outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nTherefore, the event is impossible, and its probability is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe initial analysis is confirmed by the search results. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which give the expansion of a coupled angular momentum state in terms of the uncoupled states, are non-zero only when the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly.\n\nSpecifically, the coefficient `<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>` is zero unless `m1 + m2 = m`.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>`. We want to find the probability of measuring the system to be in the uncoupled state corresponding to `L1z = -ħ` and `L2z = -ħ`. This means we are looking for the state where `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\nFor the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>` to be non-zero, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers must equal the total magnetic quantum number.\nHere, `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\nThe total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\nSince `-2 ≠ -1`, the condition is not met.\n\nTherefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0. The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is also 0. This means it is impossible to measure `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` simultaneously if the system is in the state `|l=2, m=-1>`.\n\nThe state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of the states `|m1=0, m2=-1>` and `|m1=-1, m2=0>`. The probability of measuring `m1=-1` and `m2=-1` is the squared modulus of the amplitude of the state `|m1=-1, m2=-1>` in the expansion of `|l=2, m=-1>`. As established, this amplitude is zero.\n\nFinal Answer is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe initial state of the two-electron system is the coupled angular momentum state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This state is a superposition of the uncoupled basis states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for the individual electrons.\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. This is expressed by the selection rule:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThis rule acts as a powerful constraint. For any component $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ to be part of the superposition that forms $|l, m\\rangle$, the sum of its individual magnetic quantum numbers must equal the total magnetic quantum number. If this condition is not met, the amplitude (and thus the probability) of finding the system in that component state is zero.\n\nIn this problem:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n*   The measurement is for the outcome where the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are both $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the uncoupled state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nLet's apply the constraint:\n*   Sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the target outcome: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n*   Compare this sum to the total magnetic quantum number of the system: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n\nSince $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$, the state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is not a constituent of the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\nThe probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n$P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nBecause the selection rule $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, leading to a probability of zero.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe analysis is confirmed. The measurement of individual z-components of angular momentum, $m_1$ and $m_2$, must satisfy the conservation law $m_1 + m_2 = m$, where $m$ is the total magnetic quantum number of the system.\n\n*   **System State:** The system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$, so the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   **Target Measurement:** The question asks for the probability of measuring eigenvalues corresponding to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   **Verification:** The sum of the target measurement outcomes is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the sum of the individual components ($-2$) does not equal the total component of the system ($-1$), this measurement outcome is forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics. The probability of such an event is exactly zero.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer**: The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of `L_1z` and `L_2z` to both be `-ħ`. This corresponds to measuring the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` to be `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nThe system is in a coupled angular momentum state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. The total magnetic quantum number `m` is the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2`. This is because the operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}`.\n\nTherefore, for any possible measurement outcome `(m_1, m_2)`, the condition `m = m_1 + m_2` must be satisfied.\n\nIn this problem, the state of the system has `m = -1`. The desired measurement outcome is `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\nLet's check if the condition is met: `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\nSince the required sum `(-2)` does not equal the system's total magnetic quantum number `(-1)`, it is impossible to obtain this measurement result.\n\nThus, the probability of this event is 0. I will perform a search to confirm the fundamental principle `m = m1 + m2` in the context of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n**Skeptic**: The Proposer's argument is based on the selection rule `m = m_1 + m_2`. The search results confirm this. Specifically, result states that Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which govern the transformation between uncoupled `|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>` and coupled `|l, m>` states, are non-zero only when `m = m_1 + m_2`. Result also explicitly states, \"It follows that m = m1 +m2\". Result shows how the z-component of the total angular momentum operator `J_z` acts on an uncoupled state: `J_z|j1,m1,j2,m2> = (J_1z + J_2z)|j1,m1,j2,m2> = ħ(m1 + m2)|j1,m1,j2,m2>`. This confirms that the eigenvalue of the total z-component is the sum of the individual eigenvalues.\n\nThe problem specifies the total state as `|l=2, m=-1>` and asks for the probability of measuring the individual states corresponding to `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\nThe sum `m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\nThe total `m` is `-1`.\nSince `m_1 + m_2 ≠ m`, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>` is zero. The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is also zero. The logic is sound and well-supported by fundamental principles of quantum mechanics confirmed in the search.\n\n**Decision**: The debate converges. The initial reasoning was correct and is strongly supported by the search results. The probability is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
