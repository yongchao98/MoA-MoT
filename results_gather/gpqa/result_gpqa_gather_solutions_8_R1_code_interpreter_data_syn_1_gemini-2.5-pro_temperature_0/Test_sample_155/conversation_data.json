This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs a syn-epoxidation. The reaction of an achiral trans-alkene with mCPBA (an achiral reagent, for practical purposes) can occur from the top or bottom face of the double bond with equal probability. This results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an anti-fashion (Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is opened by water, attack at C4 (inverting its configuration to S) or C5 (inverting its configuration to S) both lead to the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   When the (4S,5S)-epoxide is opened by water, attack at C4 (inverting its configuration to R) or C5 (inverting its configuration to R) both lead to the same product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This is a **meso compound**, which is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single meso compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** The syn-epoxidation of the achiral cis-alkene produces a single, achiral meso-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** The anti-attack of water on the meso-epoxide can occur at two different carbons (C4 and C5).\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products, (4S,5S)- and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are **enantiomers**. Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer to both of the chiral diols. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will appear as **one peak**. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will have different properties and will appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol is achiral and is a diastereomer to the other two compounds. It will be separated from them and will appear as its own **single peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a trans-alkene, (E)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is a stereospecific *syn*-addition. This means both oxygen-carbon bonds form on the same face of the double bond. Since the starting material is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, where the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The *anti*-opening of the racemic epoxide mixture results in a single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is because the opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide gives the (4R,5S)-diol, and the opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives the (4S,5R)-diol. These two are the same meso compound.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a cis-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. This reaction forms a single, achiral meso epoxide: (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of this meso epoxide can occur by nucleophilic attack at either of the two equivalent carbons of the epoxide.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** Attack at one carbon results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, while attack at the other carbon produces its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Therefore, this reaction yields a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric diols.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomeric pair from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound and the enantiomeric pair are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. The racemic pair will elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the meso compound from the other isomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase will also resolve the racemic mixture, separating the (4R,5R)-enantiomer from the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for each of the two enantiomers).\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   The overall process is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a meso compound. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single meso diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (Z)-oct-4-ene with the same reagents.\n    *   This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers. Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Mixture:** The chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n    *   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\n4.  **Predict the Standard HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   Standard (achiral) HPLC separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) pair) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like the meso compound and either of the enantiomers) have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Therefore, we expect two peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n5.  **Predict the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer to the other two and will also have a unique retention time, appearing as a third peak.\n    *   Therefore, we expect three distinct peaks for the three stereoisomers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the products of two stereospecific reactions and predicts the\n    number of peaks observed in standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n    # (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n    # A trans-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a meso compound.\n    reaction1_product = \"Meso-octane-4,5-diol ((4R,5S)-diol)\"\n    print(\"--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+\")\n    print(f\"Product 1: A single meso compound ({reaction1_product}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n    # (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n    # A cis-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    reaction2_products = [\"(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\", \"(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\"]\n    print(\"Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+\")\n    print(f\"Product 2: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: {reaction2_products[0]} and {reaction2_products[1]}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 3: Combine the products\n    # The final mixture contains three unique stereoisomers.\n    final_mixture = [reaction1_product] + reaction2_products\n    print(\"Combined Product Mixture contains 3 stereoisomers:\")\n    for i, compound in enumerate(final_mixture):\n        print(f\"  {i+1}. {compound}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 4: Predict Standard (Achiral) HPLC results\n    # Achiral HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n    # The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair.\n    # The two enantiomers will elute together.\n    standard_hplc_peaks = 2\n    print(\"Standard (Achiral) HPLC Analysis:\")\n    print(\" -

This is a trans-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs an epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack), resulting in an overall anti-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond. This process is called anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene. There is a general rule for such reactions on symmetrically substituted alkenes: **Trans + Anti -> Meso**.\n    *   Let's verify this. The starting (E)-oct-4-ene is achiral. The reagents are achiral. The reaction proceeds through a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide. The subsequent anti-opening of this racemic epoxide mixture yields a single meso product.\n    *   The product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which has the configuration (4R, 5S). A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers, due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a single, unique compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene. The general rule is: **Cis + Anti -> Racemic**.\n    *   Let's verify this. The starting (Z)-oct-4-ene is achiral. The epoxidation with mCPBA forms a single meso-epoxide. The subsequent anti-opening of this achiral meso-epoxide by water (an achiral nucleophile) must result in an achiral product mixture. Attack at the two carbons of the epoxide leads to two different products that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   The products are **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a racemic mixture.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture containing two different compounds (enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of the (4R, 5R)-diol.\n*   The meso-diol is also a **diastereomer** of the (4S, 5S)-diol.\n*   The (4R, 5R)-diol and the (4S, 5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   We will observe **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   A chiral column can separate diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, a chiral column can also separate enantiomers, because the two enantiomers will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated.\n    *   We will observe **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Treatment with mCPBA.** This is an epoxidation reaction. The reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the stereochemistry of the alkene is preserved in the epoxide. A *trans*-alkene gives a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral and the reagent (mCPBA) is achiral, the chiral product must be formed as a racemic mixture. The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. Water acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen atom (an Sₙ2-like, *anti*-attack).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *trans*-alkene. A useful mnemonic is **\"TAM\"**: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **M**eso compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Starting with the racemic epoxide mixture:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide undergoes anti-attack by water, leading to the (4R,5S)-diol (which is the same as the (4S,5R)-diol). This is a meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide also undergoes anti-attack, leading to the same (4S,5R)-diol (meso).\n    *   Therefore, the sole product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Treatment with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom to the *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide. The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n*   **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is the same *anti*-attack ring-opening as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *cis*-alkene. A useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"**: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   Let's verify: Starting with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxide):\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-configured) inverts it to S, giving the (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (S-configured) inverts it to R, giving the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, the two enantiomeric products must be formed in equal amounts.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral stationary phase cannot distinguish between enantiomers.

This means the oxygen adds to the same face of the double bond. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical and achiral, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The resulting product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two stereocenters but possesses an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *cis*-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. Because the starting material is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene, this reaction forms a single, achiral meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide is an *anti*-addition. The nucleophilic attack by water can occur with equal probability at either of the two carbons of the epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are a pair of enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the result is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso compound) with the products from Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of two enantiomers). The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer 1)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. The meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will have different retention times and will appear as two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a distinct retention time and will be separated from them.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the standard HPLC will show 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. Treatment with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond. This stereospecific reaction converts the *trans*-alkene into a *trans*-epoxide. Because the attack can happen from either face of the alkene, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides, (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is formed.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen atom, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide at either carbon results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide at either carbon results in the formation of (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products, (4R,5S) and (4S,5R), are identical. This product has two chiral centers but also has a plane of symmetry, making it a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. The *syn*-addition of oxygen from mCPBA converts the *cis*-alkene into a *cis*-epoxide. This epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is a meso compound itself.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis opens the meso-epoxide. The water nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons of the protonated epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon results in an inversion of configuration, leading to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon also causes an inversion, leading to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    Since the starting epoxide is achiral, attacks on either side are equally probable, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. This is a **racemic mixture**.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso compound) with the product from Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n\nThe (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. The meso isomer is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated, resulting in different retention times.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated.

The epoxidation reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. For a trans-alkene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the mCPBA can attack from either the top or bottom face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The epoxide mixture is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that opens the epoxide ring. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (an *anti*-addition or backside attack).\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is attacked by water at either C4 or C5, it results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, when the (4S,5S)-epoxide is attacked, the product is also (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two chiral centers but possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide. This specific product, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The meso-epoxide is then opened by aqueous acid. The backside attack by water can occur at either C4 or C5 with equal likelihood.\n    *   Attack at C4 (which is R) leads to inversion of stereochemistry at that carbon, producing (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (which is S) leads to inversion at that carbon, producing (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are enantiomers. Since both are formed in equal amounts, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product of Reaction 1 (the meso-diol) with the products of Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of (R,R)- and (S,S)-diols). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase and separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated.

This is a *cis*-alkene, which is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The reaction sequence is the same as in Reaction 1, resulting in a net *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These two molecules are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and are produced in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the stereochemical relationships between these three compounds:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point, solubility) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard, achiral HPLC column. The enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, will elute at the same time and appear as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are, in principle, separable by standard chromatography. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two compounds and will have a different retention time, appearing as a **separate peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers**. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times. They will be resolved into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers. There will be one peak for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer, for a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks the protonated epoxide in an *anti*-fashion (from the side opposite the epoxide C-O bond).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) results in the net *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. The two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, and they are anti to each other.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-known stereochemical rule for addition reactions: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition → **M**eso compound.\n    *   Let's verify this: The *trans*-alkene reacts via *syn*-epoxidation to form a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack of water on either enantiomer of the epoxide leads to the same single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This product has two chiral centers but possesses a center of inversion, making it a meso compound (an achiral molecule).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, the meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this case is: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition → **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   Let's verify this: The *cis*-alkene reacts via *syn*-epoxidation to form the *meso*-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack of water on this achiral meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two equivalent carbons (C4 or C5). Attack at one carbon produces the (4R,5R)-diol, and attack at the other produces the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Since the starting materials and reagents are all achiral, the chiral products must be formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-(4R,5S) diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) diol and the (4S,5S) diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso diol will have a different polarity than the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. It will elute as a distinct peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own **single peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will separate all three stereoisomers, resulting in **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a stereospecific *syn*-addition, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting alkene is preserved in the epoxide product. (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. Epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation occurs from either face of the double bond at equal rates, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The treatment of an epoxide with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the ring to form a 1,2-diol (a glycol). This ring-opening is an Sₙ2-like process that occurs with *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The *anti*-addition to the (4R,5R)-epoxide enantiomer yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The *anti*-addition to the (4S,5S)-epoxide enantiomer yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The two products, (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are actually the same achiral molecule due to a center of symmetry. This type of achiral diastereomer is called a **meso compound**. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the epoxide to the *cis*-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, produces the *cis*-epoxide. This product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The *anti*-addition of water to the achiral *meso*-epoxide can occur by attacking either of the two epoxide carbons. These two carbons are enantiotopic.\n    *   Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. This is known as a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture, which is a combination of the products from both reactions, contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe combined product mixture is then analyzed by two types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two isomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and thus cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe analysis of the reaction products and their behavior in different chromatographic systems is as follows:\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a syn-epoxidation, forming a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this epoxide by water is an anti-addition. This sequence of syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring-opening on a trans-alkene results in the formation of a single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA also proceeds via syn-epoxidation, yielding the meso epoxide, (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-ring-opening of this meso epoxide produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Product Mixture\n\nThe combined product mixture from both reactions contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to the two enantiomers. The (4R,4R) and (4S,5S) isomers are an enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   The meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair of diols are diastereomers and will be separated.\n    *   The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   Consequently, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This method utilizes a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   The meso compound will produce one peak.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved from each other, each producing a separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will display a total of **three peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The treatment of an alkene with mCPBA results in a syn-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond, forming an epoxide. The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is stereospecific and produces a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The opening of an epoxide ring with aqueous acid is an anti-addition. Water attacks the protonated epoxide from the side opposite the oxygen bridge.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane also results in (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products are the same meso compound, which has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the sole product of Reaction 1 is the meso-diol.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is also a stereospecific syn-addition. This reaction forms the cis-epoxide, (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is a meso compound because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The subsequent anti-addition of water to the meso-epoxide opens the ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the epoxide results in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the starting material is achiral and the attacks are equally probable, a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, is formed.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions, resulting in a mixture containing three stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The racemic pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.

The reaction of an achiral trans-alkene with mCPBA (an achiral reagent, for practical purposes) can occur from the top or bottom face of the double bond with equal probability. This results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide.

The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will appear as **one peak**. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will have different properties and will appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol is achiral and is a diastereomer to the other two compounds. It will be separated from them and will appear as its own **single peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a trans-alkene, (E)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is a stereospecific *syn*-addition. This means both oxygen-carbon bonds form on the same face of the double bond. Since the starting material is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, where the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The *anti*-opening of the racemic epoxide mixture results in a single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is because the opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide gives the (4R,5S)-diol, and the opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives the (4S,5R)-diol. These two are the same meso compound.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a cis-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. This reaction forms a single, achiral meso epoxide: (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of this meso epoxide can occur by nucleophilic attack at either of the two equivalent carbons of the epoxide.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** Attack at one carbon results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, while attack at the other carbon produces its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Therefore, this reaction yields a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric diols.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomeric pair from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound and the enantiomeric pair are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. The racemic pair will elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the meso compound from the other isomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase will also resolve the racemic mixture, separating the (4R,5R)-enantiomer from the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for each of the two enantiomers).\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   The overall process is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a meso compound. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single meso diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (Z)-oct-4-ene with the same reagents.\n    *   This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers. Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Mixture:** The chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n    *   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\n4.  **Predict the Standard HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   Standard (achiral) HPLC separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) pair) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like the meso compound and either of the enantiomers) have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Therefore, we expect two peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n5.  **Predict the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer to the other two and will also have a unique retention time, appearing as a third peak.\n    *   Therefore, we expect three distinct peaks for the three stereoisomers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the products of two stereospecific reactions and predicts the\n    number of peaks observed in standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n    # (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n    # A trans-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a meso compound.\n    reaction1_product = \"Meso-octane-4,5-diol ((4R,5S)-diol)\"\n    print(\"--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+\")\n    print(f\"Product 1: A single meso compound ({reaction1_product}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n    # (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n    # A cis-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    reaction2_products = [\"(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\", \"(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\"]\n    print(\"Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+\")\n    print(f\"Product 2: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: {reaction2_products[0]} and {reaction2_products[1]}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 3: Combine the products\n    # The final mixture contains three unique stereoisomers.\n    final_mixture = [reaction1_product] + reaction2_products\n    print(\"Combined Product Mixture contains 3 stereoisomers:\")\n    for i, compound in enumerate(final_mixture):\n        print(f\"  {i+1}. {compound}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 4: Predict Standard (Achiral) HPLC results\n    # Achiral HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n    # The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair.\n    # The two enantiomers will elute together.\n    standard_hplc_peaks = 2\n    print(\"Standard (Achiral) HPLC Analysis:\")\n    print(\" -

This is a trans-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs an epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack), resulting in an overall anti-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond. This process is called anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene. There is a general rule for such reactions on symmetrically substituted alkenes: **Trans + Anti -> Meso**.\n    *   Let's verify this. The starting (E)-oct-4-ene is achiral. The reagents are achiral. The reaction proceeds through a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide. The subsequent anti-opening of this racemic epoxide mixture yields a single meso product.\n    *   The product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which has the configuration (4R, 5S). A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers, due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a single, unique compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene. The general rule is: **Cis + Anti -> Racemic**.\n    *   Let's verify this. The starting (Z)-oct-4-ene is achiral. The epoxidation with mCPBA forms a single meso-epoxide. The subsequent anti-opening of this achiral meso-epoxide by water (an achiral nucleophile) must result in an achiral product mixture. Attack at the two carbons of the epoxide leads to two different products that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   The products are **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a racemic mixture.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture containing two different compounds (enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of the (4R, 5R)-diol.\n*   The meso-diol is also a **diastereomer** of the (4S, 5S)-diol.\n*   The (4R, 5R)-diol and the (4S, 5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   We will observe **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   A chiral column can separate diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, a chiral column can also separate enantiomers, because the two enantiomers will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated.\n    *   We will observe **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Treatment with mCPBA.** This is an epoxidation reaction. The reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the stereochemistry of the alkene is preserved in the epoxide. A *trans*-alkene gives a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral and the reagent (mCPBA) is achiral, the chiral product must be formed as a racemic mixture. The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. Water acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen atom (an Sₙ2-like, *anti*-attack).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *trans*-alkene. A useful mnemonic is **\"TAM\"**: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **M**eso compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Starting with the racemic epoxide mixture:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide undergoes anti-attack by water, leading to the (4R,5S)-diol (which is the same as the (4S,5R)-diol). This is a meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide also undergoes anti-attack, leading to the same (4S,5R)-diol (meso).\n    *   Therefore, the sole product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Treatment with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom to the *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide. The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n*   **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is the same *anti*-attack ring-opening as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *cis*-alkene. A useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"**: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   Let's verify: Starting with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxide):\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-configured) inverts it to S, giving the (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (S-configured) inverts it to R, giving the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, the two enantiomeric products must be formed in equal amounts.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral stationary phase cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will have the same retention time, eluting as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will elute together as **one peak**. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will elute at a different time as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC = 2.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It will also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**. The meso-diol is achiral and will elute as a **single, third peak** (at a different retention time from the other two, as it is a diastereomer).\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC = 3.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *trans*-alkene, (E)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom. This means the oxygen adds to the same face of the double bond. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical and achiral, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The resulting product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two stereocenters but possesses an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *cis*-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. Because the starting material is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene, this reaction forms a single, achiral meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide is an *anti*-addition. The nucleophilic attack by water can occur with equal probability at either of the two carbons of the epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are a pair of enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the result is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso compound) with the products from Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of two enantiomers). The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer 1)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. The meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.

Treatment with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond. This stereospecific reaction converts the *trans*-alkene into a *trans*-epoxide. Because the attack can happen from either face of the alkene, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides, (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is formed.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen atom, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide at either carbon results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide at either carbon results in the formation of (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products, (4R,5S) and (4S,5R), are identical. This product has two chiral centers but also has a plane of symmetry, making it a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. The *syn*-addition of oxygen from mCPBA converts the *cis*-alkene into a *cis*-epoxide. This epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is a meso compound itself.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis opens the meso-epoxide. The water nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons of the protonated epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon results in an inversion of configuration, leading to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon also causes an inversion, leading to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    Since the starting epoxide is achiral, attacks on either side are equally probable, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. This is a **racemic mixture**.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso compound) with the product from Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n\nThe (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. The meso isomer is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated, resulting in different retention times.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated.

The epoxidation reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. For a trans-alkene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the mCPBA can attack from either the top or bottom face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The epoxide mixture is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that opens the epoxide ring. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (an *anti*-addition or backside attack).\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is attacked by water at either C4 or C5, it results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, when the (4S,5S)-epoxide is attacked, the product is also (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two chiral centers but possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral meso product.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is treated with mCPBA. The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide. This specific product, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The meso-epoxide is then opened by aqueous acid. The backside attack by water can occur at either C4 or C5 with equal likelihood.\n    *   Attack at C4 (which is R) leads to inversion of stereochemistry at that carbon, producing (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (which is S) leads to inversion at that carbon, producing (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are enantiomers. Since both are formed in equal amounts, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product of Reaction 1 (the meso-diol) with the products of Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of (R,R)- and (S,S)-diols). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase and separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated.

It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning both C-O bonds form on the same face of the double bond.\n    *   When a trans-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral and the reagent (mCPBA) is achiral, the product must be either achiral or a racemic mixture.\n    *   The product, trans-4,5-epoxyoctane, is chiral.

This is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical alkene, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sₙ2-like) attack by a water molecule on one of the epoxide carbons. This attack is an *anti*-addition relative to the epoxide oxygen.\n*   **Overall Stereochemistry:** The two-step sequence of *syn*-epoxidation followed by *anti*-ring opening results in a net *anti*-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-established stereochemical rule for additions to alkenes: an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has stereocenters.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene, which is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The reaction sequence is the same as in Reaction 1, resulting in a net *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These two molecules are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and are produced in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the stereochemical relationships between these three compounds:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point, solubility) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard, achiral HPLC column. The enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, will elute at the same time and appear as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are, in principle, separable by standard chromatography.

The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times. They will be resolved into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers. There will be one peak for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer, for a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene.

The nucleophile (water) attacks the protonated epoxide in an *anti*-fashion (from the side opposite the epoxide C-O bond).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) results in the net *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. The two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, and they are anti to each other.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-known stereochemical rule for addition reactions: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition → **M**eso compound.\n    *   Let's verify this: The *trans*-alkene reacts via *syn*-epoxidation to form a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack of water on either enantiomer of the epoxide leads to the same single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This product has two chiral centers but possesses a center of inversion, making it a meso compound (an achiral molecule).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, the meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this case is: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition → **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   Let's verify this: The *cis*-alkene reacts via *syn*-epoxidation to form the *meso*-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack of water on this achiral meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two equivalent carbons (C4 or C5). Attack at one carbon produces the (4R,5R)-diol, and attack at the other produces the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Since the starting materials and reagents are all achiral, the chiral products must be formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-(4R,5S) diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) diol and the (4S,5S) diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso diol will have a different polarity than the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. It will elute as a distinct peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own **single peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will separate all three stereoisomers, resulting in **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a stereospecific *syn*-addition, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting alkene is preserved in the epoxide product. (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. Epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation occurs from either face of the double bond at equal rates, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The treatment of an epoxide with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the ring to form a 1,2-diol (a glycol). This ring-opening is an Sₙ2-like process that occurs with *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The *anti*-addition to the (4R,5R)-epoxide enantiomer yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The *anti*-addition to the (4S,5S)-epoxide enantiomer yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The two products, (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are actually the same achiral molecule due to a center of symmetry. This type of achiral diastereomer is called a **meso compound**. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the epoxide to the *cis*-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, produces the *cis*-epoxide. This product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The *anti*-addition of water to the achiral *meso*-epoxide can occur by attacking either of the two epoxide carbons. These two carbons are enantiotopic.\n    *   Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. This is known as a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture, which is a combination of the products from both reactions, contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe combined product mixture is then analyzed by two types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two isomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and thus cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe analysis of the reaction products and their behavior in different chromatographic systems is as follows:\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a syn-epoxidation, forming a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this epoxide by water is an anti-addition. This sequence of syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring-opening on a trans-alkene results in the formation of a single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA also proceeds via syn-epoxidation, yielding the meso epoxide, (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-ring-opening of this meso epoxide produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Product Mixture\n\nThe combined product mixture from both reactions contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to the two enantiomers. The (4R,4R) and (4S,5S) isomers are an enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   The meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair of diols are diastereomers and will be separated.\n    *   The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   Consequently, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This method utilizes a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   The meso compound will produce one peak.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved from each other, each producing a separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will display a total of **three peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The treatment of an alkene with mCPBA results in a syn-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond, forming an epoxide. The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is stereospecific and produces a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The opening of an epoxide ring with aqueous acid is an anti-addition. Water attacks the protonated epoxide from the side opposite the oxygen bridge.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane also results in (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products are the same meso compound, which has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the sole product of Reaction 1 is the meso-diol.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is also a stereospecific syn-addition. This reaction forms the cis-epoxide, (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is a meso compound because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The subsequent anti-addition of water to the meso-epoxide opens the ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the epoxide results in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the starting material is achiral and the attacks are equally probable, a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, is formed.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions, resulting in a mixture containing three stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The racemic pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and appear as a distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
