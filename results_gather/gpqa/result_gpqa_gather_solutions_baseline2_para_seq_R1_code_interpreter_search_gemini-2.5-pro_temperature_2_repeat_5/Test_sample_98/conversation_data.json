Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the options lies in the complex splitting patterns described. We need to find a structure that has protons matching these descriptions.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, n+1=4 lines).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This proton is also split by three different sets of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to another set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3 lines).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's draw each structure and predict the splitting patterns for its unique protons. We will number the main carbon chain starting from the carboxyl carbon (C1).\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid**\n`CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), H's at C5 (2H, triplet), and H's on its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet) and H's on its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   This structure provides a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nThis formula represents the following structure:\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\nLet's analyze the protons on the main chain:\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n    *   The two H's of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   The three H's of the methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n    *   This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n    *   The two H's of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   The two H's of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n*   This structure perfectly matches both pieces of complex splitting information from the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, d), H's at C5 (3H, q), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This would be a complex signal (dqd), but not a dtq.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, d), H's at C2 (2H, t), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dqt.\n*   This structure does not match the data.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, d), H's at C4 (2H, t), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dtq. However, let's check for the dtt.\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, d) and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dq.\n*   This structure provides a `dtq` (or tdq) but not a `dtt`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **B**, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum. The FTIR data is also consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   \"No vinyl-hydrogens\": This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four options are saturated, so this is consistent.\n    *   \"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\". This means a specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the doublet (d) splitting (n+1=2).\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the triplet (t) splitting (n+1=3).\n        *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing the quartet (q) splitting (n+1=4).\n        *   Note: The order of the letters (d, t, q) can vary depending on the relative size of the coupling constants (J-values), but the chemical meaning remains the same: the proton is coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H set of neighbors. We will look for a proton with this environment, which could be described as `dtq`, `dqt`, `tqd`, `tdq`, `qdt`, or `qtd`.\n    *   \"A different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\". This means another specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (d).\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (t).\n        *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second triplet (t).\n        *   We are looking for a proton coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and another 2H set of neighbors. This could be described as `dtt` or `tdt`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Structure of Each Option\n\nWe need to interpret the condensed structural formulas and predict the splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule. We will assume a standard linear interpretation of the formulas and use IUPAC naming to clarify the structures.\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This formula corresponds to **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H4**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H3` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH3(5)` (3 neighbors) -> quartet (q)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This matches the `dtq` signal required.\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `CH2(2)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   `H4` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt)**. A `tdt` pattern arises from coupling to (2H, 1H, 2H), while a `dtt` arises from (1H, 2H, 2H). Both are split by one proton and two different sets of two protons, resulting in 18 lines (in a first-order spectrum). Given the options, it is highly probable that this `tdt` signal is the one described as `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(Et)(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H2` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH2(4)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Does it have a `dqt` signal? Let's check other protons. H2 is a doublet of triplets (`dt`). The `CH2` protons are all doublets of quartets (`dq`). There is no proton coupled to (1H, 2H, 3H).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtt` but lacks a `dqt`.\n\n**C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(Me)(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH2(4)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H2` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH2(4)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   The `CH3` on its own carbon (3 neighbors) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Does it have a `dtt` signal? No. H2 is a `dq`. H4 is a `dq`. There is no proton coupled to (1H, 2H, 2H).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Proton H3 is coupled to `CH2(2)` (2H, t), `H4` (1H, d), and `CH3` on C3 (3H, q). This gives a `tdq`. This matches the `dtq` requirement.\n    *   Proton H4 is coupled to `H3` (1H, d) and the six protons of the isopropyl group (6H, septet). This gives a `doublet of septets`. It does not have a `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq`-type signal but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the splitting patterns for each structure, we find the following:\n*   **A) 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dqt` signal and a `tdt` signal.\n*   **B) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dtt` signal, but no `dqt` signal.\n*   **C) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dtq` signal, but no `dtt` signal.\n*   **D) 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `tdq` (or `dqt`) signal, but no `dtt` signal.\n\nOnly structure **A** possesses two different protons that exhibit the required high level of complex splitting: one proton is coupled to a (1H, 2H, 3H) environment, and another is coupled to a (1H, 2H, 2H) or (2H, 1H, 2H) environment. The signal described as `dtt` in the problem corresponds to the `tdt` signal from structure A. Therefore, structure A is the only option that fits all the data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the options.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four proposed structures are saturated, so they are all consistent with this piece of information.\n*   **\"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: This is a very complex splitting pattern, which means the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d)** implies coupling to **1** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t)** implies coupling to **2** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Quartet (q)** implies coupling to **3** neighboring protons.\n    *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtq` signal must have neighbors: a `CH` group (1H), a `CH₂` group (2H), and a `CH₃` group (3H).\n*   **\"...a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This proton is also coupled to three different sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d)** implies coupling to **1** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t)** implies coupling to **2** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Another Triplet (t)** implies coupling to another, different `CH₂` group (2H).\n    *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtt` signal must have neighbors: a `CH` group (1H), a `CH₂` group, and another non-equivalent `CH₂` group.\n\n**3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see if it can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(e)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is adjacent to H(c) (1H), a CH₃ group (3H), and a CH₂(e) group (2H). This would give a **dqt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dtt check:** To have a `dtt` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. This molecule only contains one CH₂ group (e). Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Option A is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH₂(d)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is adjacent to H(b) (1H), a CH₂(d) group (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). This would give a **dqt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dtt check:** This molecule only contains one CH₂ group (d). Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Option D is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(c)(Et)-CH(b)(Et)-CH₂(d)CH₃(e)`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is adjacent to H(c) (1H), the CH₂ of its own ethyl substituent (2H), and the CH₂(d) of the backbone (2H). This would give a **dtt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dqt check:** To have a `dqt` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group. Let's check the protons. None of the CH protons (b or c) are adjacent to a methyl group. The protons of the CH₂ groups (e.g., d) are adjacent to a CH (b) and a CH₃ (e), but not another CH₂ group. They are also adjacent to each other (geminal coupling, 1H). This would result in a `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets), not a `dqt`. Option C is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\nFirst, let's determine the correct structure from this condensed formula. The main chain is `C-C(Et)-C(Et)-C-COOH`. To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group. This is a 6-carbon chain, making it a hexanoic acid derivative.\nThe structure is `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\nLet's analyze the key protons in **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**:\n```\n          CH₃(g)   C₂H₅(e,f)\n          |        |\nHOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)----CH(c)----CH₂(d)-CH₃(h)\n```\n*   **Proton H(c):** This proton is on carbon 4. It is adjacent to:\n    *   H(b) on carbon 3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    *   CH₂(d) on carbon 5 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    *   CH₃(g) substituent (3H) → quartet (q)\n    The resulting signal for H(c) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dqt)**. This matches the first described signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton is on carbon 3. It is adjacent to:\n    *   H(c) on carbon 4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    *   CH₂(a) on carbon 2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    *   CH₂(e) of its ethyl substituent (2H) → triplet (t)\n    The resulting signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second described signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe structure of 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, which is represented by the condensed formula in option B, is the only one that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. It is a carboxylic acid, has no vinyl protons, and its structure predicts the presence of both a `dqt` and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules (containing only single C-C bonds), so this observation is consistent with all of them.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons:\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\n**3. Understanding Complex Splitting (n+1 rule)**\n\nThe splitting of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal coupling). A signal is split into `n+1` peaks, where `n` is the number of neighboring protons.\n\n*   A **doublet (d)** means 1 neighboring proton (`1+1=2`).\n*   A **triplet (t)** means 2 neighboring protons (`2+1=3`).\n*   A **quartet (q)** means 3 neighboring protons (`3+1=4`).\n\nA complex pattern like `dtq` or `dtt` arises when a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons. To have three neighboring groups, the proton must be on a carbon that is bonded to three other carbons, each bearing protons.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze each structure to see if its protons would produce the observed splitting patterns. We will focus on the methine protons (-CH-), as they are most likely to have multiple, distinct neighbors.\n\n*   **Structure C: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   `CH3 - CH(b)(CH3) - CH(c)(CH3) - CH2(d) - COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to `CH2(d)` (2H), `CH(b)` (1H), and its own methyl group (3H).\n        *   Coupling to `CH2(d)` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(b)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to its own methyl (3H) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **dtq**.

Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The peak is characteristically very broad, often spanning from ~2500 cm⁻¹ to ~3300 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. We must use the NMR data to differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n*   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton's signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, we consider each group of neighboring protons separately.\n*   Doublet (d): Coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   Triplet (t): Coupling to 2 neighboring protons.\n*   Quartet (q): Coupling to 3 neighboring protons.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **dtq** implies a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one group with 1 proton, one group with 2 protons, and one group with 3 protons.\n*   **dtt** implies a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one group with 1 proton, one group with 2 protons, and another group with 2 protons.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see which one would produce both of these signals. We'll determine the IUPAC name for each condensed formula to have a clear structure.\n\n---\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n`COOH(1)-CH(a)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(c)-CH₃(d)`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(a)` (1 neighbor), the `CH₂(c)` group (2 neighbors), and its attached `CH₃` group... wait, no. Vicinal coupling is to neighbors on adjacent carbons. So, `H(b)` is coupled to `H(a)` (1H) and `CH₂(c)` (2H). There is also a methyl group on the same carbon, but that is not vicinal coupling. Let's re-read the structure, the formula must be `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. The chain is 6 carbons long. Let's draw it and label the protons.\n`CH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)(CH₃(f))-CH(a)(CH₃(e))-COOH`\n*   **`H(b)`:** Coupled to `H(a)` (1H), `CH₂(c)` (2H), and the protons of the methyl group `CH₃(f)` (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would result in a **dtq** signal. So, this molecule has a `dtq` signal.\n*   **`dtt` signal?** A `dtt` requires (1H, 2H, 2H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this combination of neighbors. Thus, compound A is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)(C₂H₅(g))-CH(a)(C₂H₅(f))-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(a)` (1H), the `CH₂(c)` group (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(g)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This would result in a **dtt** signal. So, this molecule has a `dtt` signal.\n*   **`dtq` signal?** A `dtq` requires (1H, 2H, 3H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this specific combination. For example, the diastereotopic protons of `CH₂(c)` are coupled to `H(b)` (1H), `CH₃(d)` (3H), and each other (1H), which would give a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a `dtq`. Thus, compound C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH(c)(CH₃(f))-CH(b)(CH₃(e))-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(c)` (1H), the `CH₂(a)` group (2H), and the protons of its methyl substituent `CH₃(e)` (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would result in a **dtq** signal.\n*   **`dtt` signal?** A `dtt` requires (1H, 2H, 2H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this combination. Thus, compound D is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH(c)(C₂H₅(g))-CH(b)(C₂H₅(f))-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze proton **`H(b)`**. It is coupled to the `CH₂(a)` group (2H), `H(c)` (1H), and the `CH₂` protons of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(f)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This proton would show a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) splitting pattern. **This matches one of the required signals.**\n*   Let's analyze proton **`H(c)`**. It is coupled to `H(b)` (1H), the `CH₃(d)` group (3H), and the `CH₂` protons of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(g)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This proton would show a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) splitting pattern. **This matches the other required signal.**\n\nConclusion: Compound B is the only structure that has one proton (`H(b)`) that would produce a `dtt` signal and another proton (`H(c)`) that would produce a `dtq` signal. Therefore, it is the correct structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding (dimerization).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices. The absence of peaks in the vinyl region (around 1650 cm⁻¹ for C=C and 3010-3100 cm⁻¹ for =C-H) is also consistent with the NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is given by the `n+1` rule, where `n` is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, the splitting pattern becomes a \"multiplet of multiplets.\"\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It's coupled to a group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** It's coupled to a group of three neighboring protons (n=3).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different proton is also being split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It's coupled to a group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Another Triplet (t):** It's coupled to another, different group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n\nThese highly complex splitting patterns typically arise from methine protons (CH) in a complex, chiral environment.

This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   No signals corresponding to vinyl hydrogens.

Analysis of the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to find the single structure that contains protons that would give rise to *both* a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal. I will analyze the most complex protons in each structure, which are the methine protons (`-CH-`) on the carbon chain.\n\n*   **Structure A: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n    This is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid, or `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂(e)-`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-4 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` group at carbon-2 (2H, triplet), and the methyl group at carbon-3 (3H, quartet).\n    *   This gives a `dtq` signal. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton, a two-proton group, and another two-proton group. Thus, there is no `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Structure B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n    This is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid, `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `...-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH(f)...`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-2 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` of the ethyl group at the end of the chain (2H, triplet), and the `CH₂` of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, triplet).\n    *   This gives a `dtt` signal. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbours. The methine proton on C2 would be a doublet of triplets. Methylene protons in the ethyl groups would be complex multiplets (likely ddq's), but not a clean `dtq`.\n\n*   **Structure D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n    This is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `...-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(e)...`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-2 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` group of the terminal ethyl group (2H, triplet), and the methyl group substituent (3H, quartet).\n    *   This gives a `dtq` signal. However, similar to structure A, there is no environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Structure C: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    This corresponds to the structure **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`.

Let's interpret the line formula `CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH` correctly.\n    It describes a pentanoic acid backbone with ethyl groups on carbons 3 and 4: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₃`.\n    Let's analyze the methine protons on carbons 3 and 4 of **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H-4):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₃` group at C5 (3H, gives a **quartet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C3 (1H, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H-4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H-3):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C4 (1H, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group at C2 (2H, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, gives another **triplet**).\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H-3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.

This is consistent with all four proposed structures, as none contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   **\"One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: According to the n+1 rule, this means a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to 2 adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   **Quartet (q)**: Coupled to 3 adjacent protons (a CH₃ group).\n    *   **\"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This means a different single proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to 2 adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to another, non-equivalent set of 2 adjacent protons (another CH₂ group).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons (the CH methine protons) in each structure. We will number the carbon chains starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H's at C2 (2H, triplet), and its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This gives a **tdq** (or **dtq**). This matches one of the signals.\n    *   **H at C4**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the terminal CH₃ at C5 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqq**. This does not match the `dtt` signal. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C2**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq**.\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet). This gives a **dqt**. Neither signal matches the required `dtq` and `dtt` pair. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    The condensed formula `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` corresponds to 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid when the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group is identified.\n    Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    Let's analyze the key methine protons:\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H's at C2 (2H, triplet), and the H's on the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets). This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   **H at C4**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), H's at C5 (2H, triplet), and the H's of its methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets). This matches the other required signal.\n    *   Since this structure produces both the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals, it is the correct answer.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), H's at C4 (2H, triplet), and the H's of its ethyl group's CH₂ (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n    *   Are there any other protons that would give a `dtq`? The other methine proton is at C2. H at C2 is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet), giving a `dt`. There are no protons coupled to a CH, a CH₂, *and* a CH₃ group. Therefore, this structure cannot produce a `dtq` signal. So, D is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion**\n    Only the structure corresponding to option C, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, gives rise to both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum, matching the experimental data perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group class but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) described in the 1H NMR data.\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This confirms there are no C=C double bonds in the molecule, which is consistent with all four structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern arises when a single proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (2+1=3).\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet (3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} set of neighbors. The order (dtq vs. tqd vs. qdt, etc.) depends on the relative sizes of the coupling constants (J-values), but the set of neighbors must be the same.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), giving a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving a **t**riplet.\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving another **t**riplet.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} set of neighbors.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the local environment of the methine (CH) protons in each structure to see if they match the required splitting patterns.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- of the ethyl group (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This is a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, which would produce a **dtq** (or tqd/qdt). This matches one signal.\n*   H at C2: Coupled to the H at C3 (1H), the -CH₃ on C2 (3H), and the -COOH proton (1H). This is a {1H, 3H, 1H} environment, which would produce a doublet of quartets of doublets (dqd). This does not match the `dtt` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**B) (CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the -CH₂- group (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This is a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, producing a **dtq**. This matches one signal.\n*   H at C4: Coupled to the H at C3 (1H) and the two -CH₃ groups of the isopropyl tail (6H). This is a {1H, 6H} environment, producing a doublet of septets. This does not match the `dtt` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- of the C4-ethyl group (2H), and the -CH₂- of its own C3-ethyl group (2H). This is a {1H, 2H, 2H} environment, which would produce a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n*   H at C2: Coupled to H at C3 (1H), the -CH₂- of its own C2-ethyl group (2H), and the -COOH proton (1H). This is a {1H, 2H, 1H} environment, which would produce a doublet of triplets of doublets (dtd). This does not match the `dtq` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n**C) CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH**\nLet's analyze the structure based on the provided formula, assuming a backbone of `CH3-CH-CH-CH2-COOH`. Let's label the methine protons H_a and H_b.\n`CH₃ - CH_a(C₂H₅) - CH_b(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton H_a**: Let's identify its neighbors.\n    *   On the adjacent methyl group: 3 protons.\n    *   The adjacent methine proton: H_b (1 proton).\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group attached to its carbon: 2 protons.\n    *   The set of neighbors is **{3H, 1H, 2H}**. This will produce a **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**, which is a permutation of `dtq`. **This is a match.**\n\n*   **Proton H_b**: Let's identify its neighbors.\n    *   The adjacent methine proton: H_a (1 proton).\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) next to the carboxylic acid: 2 protons.\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group attached to its carbon: 2 protons.\n    *   The set of neighbors is **{1H, 2H, 2H}**. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. **This is a match.**\n\n*   **Result:** Correct. This structure is the only one that possesses one proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} neighborhood (`dtq`) and a different proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighborhood (`dtt`).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the 1H NMR splitting patterns, compound C is the only candidate that matches the experimental data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. This broad peak typically overlaps with the C-H stretching absorptions.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all options but does not distinguish between them.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this information.\n    *   **Key Information**: The spectrum contains two particularly complex and revealing signals: a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt). These multiplicities arise from a proton's signal being split by neighboring, non-equivalent protons. The N+1 rule applies for each group of equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, gives a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives a triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (3H, gives a quartet).\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, gives a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives a triplet), and another distinct group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives another triplet).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Potential Structure against the NMR Data:**\n    Let's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule. We will focus on the most complex signals, which come from the CH (methine) protons on the carbon backbone. Note that in molecules with chiral centers, adjacent CH₂ protons are often diastereotopic (non-equivalent), which can complicate splitting patterns (e.g., turning an expected triplet into a doublet of doublets). However, the given names (`dtq`, `dtt`) suggest that we can, at a first-order approximation, treat these as equivalent protons for splitting purposes, or that there is \"accidental equivalence\" where the coupling constants are very similar.\n\n    Let's write out the structures assuming linear depiction and standard IUPAC naming conventions:\n\n    *   **A) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet) and the two protons at C2 (2H, triplet). Expected signal: `dt`.\n        *   Proton at C4: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the three protons at C5 (3H, quartet). Expected signal: `dq`.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt` or `dtq`.\n\n    *   **B) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to protons at C2 (2H, `t`), proton at C4 (1H, `d`), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, `t`). Expected signal: `tdt`.\n        *   Proton at C4: Coupled to proton at C3 (1H, `d`), protons at C5 (3H, `q`), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, `t`). Expected signal: `dqt` (doublet of quartets of triplets). This is close to `dtq`, just different order.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt`. It has a `tdt` and a `dqt`.\n\n    *   **C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C2: Coupled only to H at C3 (1H, doublet). Expected signal: `d`.\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet) and the two protons at C4 (2H, triplet). Expected signal: `dt`.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt` or `dtq`.\n\n    *   **D) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Let's analyze the proton at **C3**. It is adjacent to three different carbons bearing protons:\n            1.  C2, which has one proton (H at C2). This will split the C3-proton signal into a **doublet**.\n            2.  C4, which has two protons (the CH₂ group). These will split the C3-proton signal into a **triplet**.\n            3.  The first carbon of the ethyl group attached to C3, which is also a CH₂ group with two protons. These will also split the C3-proton signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for the proton at C3 is expected to be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for one of the signals described in the problem.\n        *   Now let's look for the **`dtq`** signal. While there isn't a proton with the exact neighboring environment (adjacent to 1H, 2H, and 3H groups) to produce a simple `dtq`, let's examine the protons in one of the diastereotopic CH₂ groups. For instance, the CH₂ protons at C4. They are adjacent to the CH proton at C3 and the CH₃ protons at C5. Due to being next to a chiral center (C3) and having geminal coupling to each other, their signal would be a **doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq)**. A `ddq` is a complex multiplet that can, under certain conditions or lower resolution, be mistaken for or reported as a `dtq`. Given the definitive and rare `dtt` signal is perfectly explained by this structure, it is the most plausible candidate. No other option can account for the `dtt` signal.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The structure of 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid (D) is the only one that can produce a `dtt` signal for the proton on C3. This provides extremely strong evidence for its identity. The other signal, `dtq`, is likely a slightly simplified description of one of the `ddq` signals present in the molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nFirst, let's interpret the information from the characterization techniques.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group class but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). All four options are saturated molecules (containing only single bonds between carbons), so this is consistent with all of them.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises from a proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons. According to the n+1 rule:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1, multiplicity=1+1=2).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2, multiplicity=2+1=3).\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupling to 3 neighboring protons (n=3, multiplicity=3+1=4).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises from a proton coupled to:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n        *   **Another Triplet (t):** Coupling to a different group of 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in finding the single molecule that would produce *both* of these unique splitting patterns.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each of the proposed structures. The way the condensed formulas are written implies a sequential backbone.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - C(a)H(CH₃) - C(b)H(CH₃) - CH₂ - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(a) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ (2H), and its own CH₃ (3H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Other protons:** None of the other protons (H(a), CH₂, CH₃) are coupled to one proton, a group of two, and another group of two protons. Therefore, this molecule does not have a dtt signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - CH₂ - C(a)H(CH₃) - C(b)H(CH₃) - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(a):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ (2H), and its own CH₃ (3H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one signal.\n*   **Other protons:** Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (1H) and two different CH₃ groups (3H and 3H). This would give a doublet of quartets of quartets (or a doublet of septets if the methyls were equivalent). No proton in this molecule would produce a dtt signal.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - C(a)H(C₂H₅) - C(b)H(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(a) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ of the main chain (2H), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Other protons:** We now need to find a dtq signal (a proton coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors). Let's check the methylene protons. The -CH₂- protons in the main chain are coupled to H(b) (1H) and the terminal -CH₃ (3H). They would give a doublet of quartets (dq). The -CH₂- protons within the ethyl groups are also coupled to one methine proton (H(a) or H(b)) and one methyl group, which would also result in a dq. Therefore, this molecule does not have a dtq signal.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's analyze the structure as written: a backbone of `C-C-C-C-COOH` with specified substituents.\n`CH₃(a) - C(b)H(C₂H₅) - C(e)H(C₂H₅) - C(h)H₂ - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    1.  The CH₃(a) group (3 protons) → creates a **quartet**.\n    2.  The methine proton H(e) (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n    3.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(e):** This proton also has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    1.  The methine proton H(b) (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n    2.  The CH₂(h) group (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n    3.  The CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2 protons) → creates another **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nCompound C is the only candidate that possesses protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR data.

We will determine the IUPAC name for clarity.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   Proton at C3: Is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the `CH₂` at C4 (2H), and the attached `CH₃` group (3H). This would give a `dqt` (doublet of quartets of triplets) signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   Proton at C3: Is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the `CH₂` at C4 (2H), and the `CH₂` of its own ethyl group (2H). This would give a `dtt` signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, *and* a `CH₃` group simultaneously. It cannot produce a `dtq` signal.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   Proton at C3: Is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the `CH₂` at C2 (2H), and the attached `CH₃` group (3H). This would give a `dqt` signal.\n    *   However, this molecule only contains one `CH₂` group, so it is impossible for any proton to be coupled to two different `CH₂` groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   Let's interpret this formula structurally: `CH₃ - CH(Et) - CH(Et) - CH₂ - COOH`. Numbering the main pentanoic acid chain from the carboxyl end:\n    *   `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   Let's analyze the two key methine protons:\n        *   **Proton at C3**: This proton is adjacent to the methine proton at C4 (1H), the methylene (`CH₂`) group at C2 (2H), and the methylene (`CH₂`) group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H). Its neighborhood is {1H, 2H, 2H}. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. **This matches Signal 2.**\n        *   **Proton at C4**: This proton is adjacent to the methine proton at C3 (1H), the methylene (`CH₂`) group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H), and the methyl (`CH₃`) group at C5 (3H). Its neighborhood is {1H, 2H, 3H}. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. **This matches Signal 1.**\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.** This structure is the only one that contains protons that would produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe compound must be 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, which is correctly represented by the condensed formula `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's draw each structure and predict the splitting patterns for its unique protons. We will number the main carbon chain starting from the carboxyl carbon (C1).\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid**\n`CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), H's at C5 (2H, triplet), and H's on its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet) and H's on its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   This structure provides a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nThis formula represents the following structure:\n`CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\nLet's analyze the protons on the main chain:\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n    *   The two H's of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet**\n    *   The three H's of the methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n    *   This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.

This would be a complex signal (dqd), but not a dtq.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, d), H's at C2 (2H, t), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dqt.\n*   This structure does not match the data.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, d), H's at C4 (2H, t), and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dtq. However, let's check for the dtt.\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, d) and H's of its methyl group (3H, q). This gives a dq.\n*   This structure provides a `dtq` (or tdq) but not a `dtt`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **B**, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum. The FTIR data is also consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   \"No vinyl-hydrogens\": This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four options are saturated, so this is consistent.\n    *   \"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\". This means a specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the doublet (d) splitting (n+1=2).\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the triplet (t) splitting (n+1=3).\n        *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing the quartet (q) splitting (n+1=4).\n        *   Note: The order of the letters (d, t, q) can vary depending on the relative size of the coupling constants (J-values), but the chemical meaning remains the same: the proton is coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H set of neighbors. We will look for a proton with this environment, which could be described as `dtq`, `dqt`, `tqd`, `tdq`, `qdt`, or `qtd`.\n    *   \"A different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\". This means another specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (d).\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (t).\n        *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second triplet (t).\n        *   We are looking for a proton coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and another 2H set of neighbors. This could be described as `dtt` or `tdt`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Structure of Each Option\n\nWe need to interpret the condensed structural formulas and predict the splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule. We will assume a standard linear interpretation of the formulas and use IUPAC naming to clarify the structures.\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This formula corresponds to **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H4**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H3` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH3(5)` (3 neighbors) -> quartet (q)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This matches the `dtq` signal required.\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `CH2(2)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   `H4` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt)**. A `tdt` pattern arises from coupling to (2H, 1H, 2H), while a `dtt` arises from (1H, 2H, 2H). Both are split by one proton and two different sets of two protons, resulting in 18 lines (in a first-order spectrum). Given the options, it is highly probable that this `tdt` signal is the one described as `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(Et)(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H2` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH2(4)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   The `CH2` of its ethyl group (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Does it have a `dqt` signal? Let's check other protons. H2 is a doublet of triplets (`dt`). The `CH2` protons are all doublets of quartets (`dq`). There is no proton coupled to (1H, 2H, 3H).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtt` but lacks a `dqt`.\n\n**C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** This corresponds to **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(Me)(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH2(4)-CH3(5)`\n*   **Splitting Analysis:**\n    *   Let's analyze proton **H3**. It is coupled to:\n        *   `H2` (1 neighbor) -> doublet (d)\n        *   `CH2(4)` (2 neighbors) -> triplet (t)\n        *   The `CH3` on its own carbon (3 neighbors) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Does it have a `dtt` signal? No. H2 is a `dq`. H4 is a `dq`.

Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the splitting patterns for each structure, we find the following:\n*   **A) 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dqt` signal and a `tdt` signal.\n*   **B) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dtt` signal, but no `dqt` signal.\n*   **C) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `dtq` signal, but no `dtt` signal.\n*   **D) 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid:** Has a `tdq` (or `dqt`) signal, but no `dtt` signal.\n\nOnly structure **A** possesses two different protons that exhibit the required high level of complex splitting: one proton is coupled to a (1H, 2H, 3H) environment, and another is coupled to a (1H, 2H, 2H) or (2H, 1H, 2H) environment. The signal described as `dtt` in the problem corresponds to the `tdt` signal from structure A. Therefore, structure A is the only option that fits all the data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the options.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four proposed structures are saturated, so they are all consistent with this piece of information.\n*   **\"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: This is a very complex splitting pattern, which means the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d)** implies coupling to **1** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t)** implies coupling to **2** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Quartet (q)** implies coupling to **3** neighboring protons.\n    *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtq` signal must have neighbors: a `CH` group (1H), a `CH₂` group (2H), and a `CH₃` group (3H).\n*   **\"...a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This proton is also coupled to three different sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d)** implies coupling to **1** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t)** implies coupling to **2** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Another Triplet (t)** implies coupling to another, different `CH₂` group (2H).\n    *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtt` signal must have neighbors: a `CH` group (1H), a `CH₂` group, and another non-equivalent `CH₂` group.\n\n**3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see if it can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(e)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is adjacent to H(c) (1H), a CH₃ group (3H), and a CH₂(e) group (2H). This would give a **dqt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dtt check:** To have a `dtt` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. This molecule only contains one CH₂ group (e). Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Option A is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH₂(d)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is adjacent to H(b) (1H), a CH₂(d) group (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). This would give a **dqt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dtt check:** This molecule only contains one CH₂ group (d). Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Option D is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(c)(Et)-CH(b)(Et)-CH₂(d)CH₃(e)`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is adjacent to H(c) (1H), the CH₂ of its own ethyl substituent (2H), and the CH₂(d) of the backbone (2H). This would give a **dtt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dqt check:** To have a `dqt` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group. Let's check the protons. None of the CH protons (b or c) are adjacent to a methyl group. The protons of the CH₂ groups (e.g., d) are adjacent to a CH (b) and a CH₃ (e), but not another CH₂ group. They are also adjacent to each other (geminal coupling, 1H). This would result in a `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets), not a `dqt`. Option C is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\nFirst, let's determine the correct structure from this condensed formula. The main chain is `C-C(Et)-C(Et)-C-COOH`. To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group. This is a 6-carbon chain, making it a hexanoic acid derivative.\nThe structure is `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\nLet's analyze the key protons in **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**:\n```\n          CH₃(g)   C₂H₅(e,f)\n          |        |\nHOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)----CH(c)----CH₂(d)-CH₃(h)\n```\n*   **Proton H(c):** This proton is on carbon 4. It is adjacent to:\n    *   H(b) on carbon 3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    *   CH₂(d) on carbon 5 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    *   CH₃(g) substituent (3H) → quartet (q)\n    The resulting signal for H(c) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dqt)**. This matches the first described signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton is on carbon 3. It is adjacent to:\n    *   H(c) on carbon 4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    *   CH₂(a) on carbon 2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    *   CH₂(e) of its ethyl substituent (2H) → triplet (t)\n    The resulting signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second described signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe structure of 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, which is represented by the condensed formula in option B, is the only one that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. It is a carboxylic acid, has no vinyl protons, and its structure predicts the presence of both a `dqt` and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules (containing only single C-C bonds), so this observation is consistent with all of them.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons:\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\n**3. Understanding Complex Splitting (n+1 rule)**\n\nThe splitting of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal coupling). A signal is split into `n+1` peaks, where `n` is the number of neighboring protons.\n\n*   A **doublet (d)** means 1 neighboring proton (`1+1=2`).\n*   A **triplet (t)** means 2 neighboring protons (`2+1=3`).\n*   A **quartet (q)** means 3 neighboring protons (`3+1=4`).\n\nA complex pattern like `dtq` or `dtt` arises when a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons. To have three neighboring groups, the proton must be on a carbon that is bonded to three other carbons, each bearing protons.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze each structure to see if its protons would produce the observed splitting patterns. We will focus on the methine protons (-CH-), as they are most likely to have multiple, distinct neighbors.\n\n*   **Structure C: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   `CH3 - CH(b)(CH3) - CH(c)(CH3) - CH2(d) - COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to `CH2(d)` (2H), `CH(b)` (1H), and its own methyl group (3H).\n        *   Coupling to `CH2(d)` (2H) -> triplet (t)\n        *   Coupling to `CH(b)` (1H) -> doublet (d)\n        *   Coupling to its own methyl (3H) -> quartet (q)\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **dtq**.

Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The peak is characteristically very broad, often spanning from ~2500 cm⁻¹ to ~3300 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. We must use the NMR data to differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n*   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton's signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, we consider each group of neighboring protons separately.\n*   Doublet (d): Coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   Triplet (t): Coupling to 2 neighboring protons.\n*   Quartet (q): Coupling to 3 neighboring protons.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **dtq** implies a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one group with 1 proton, one group with 2 protons, and one group with 3 protons.\n*   **dtt** implies a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one group with 1 proton, one group with 2 protons, and another group with 2 protons.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see which one would produce both of these signals. We'll determine the IUPAC name for each condensed formula to have a clear structure.\n\n---\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n`COOH(1)-CH(a)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(c)-CH₃(d)`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(a)` (1 neighbor), the `CH₂(c)` group (2 neighbors), and its attached `CH₃` group... wait, no. Vicinal coupling is to neighbors on adjacent carbons. So, `H(b)` is coupled to `H(a)` (1H) and `CH₂(c)` (2H). There is also a methyl group on the same carbon, but that is not vicinal coupling. Let's re-read the structure, the formula must be `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. The chain is 6 carbons long. Let's draw it and label the protons.\n`CH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)(CH₃(f))-CH(a)(CH₃(e))-COOH`\n*   **`H(b)`:** Coupled to `H(a)` (1H), `CH₂(c)` (2H), and the protons of the methyl group `CH₃(f)` (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would result in a **dtq** signal. So, this molecule has a `dtq` signal.\n*   **`dtt` signal?** A `dtt` requires (1H, 2H, 2H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this combination of neighbors. Thus, compound A is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)(C₂H₅(g))-CH(a)(C₂H₅(f))-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(a)` (1H), the `CH₂(c)` group (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(g)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This would result in a **dtt** signal. So, this molecule has a `dtt` signal.\n*   **`dtq` signal?** A `dtq` requires (1H, 2H, 3H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this specific combination. For example, the diastereotopic protons of `CH₂(c)` are coupled to `H(b)` (1H), `CH₃(d)` (3H), and each other (1H), which would give a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a `dtq`. Thus, compound C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH(c)(CH₃(f))-CH(b)(CH₃(e))-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(c)` (1H), the `CH₂(a)` group (2H), and the protons of its methyl substituent `CH₃(e)` (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would result in a **dtq** signal.\n*   **`dtt` signal?** A `dtt` requires (1H, 2H, 2H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this combination. Thus, compound D is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH(c)(C₂H₅(g))-CH(b)(C₂H₅(f))-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze proton **`H(b)`**. It is coupled to the `CH₂(a)` group (2H), `H(c)` (1H), and the `CH₂` protons of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(f)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This proton would show a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) splitting pattern. **This matches one of the required signals.**\n*   Let's analyze proton **`H(c)`**. It is coupled to `H(b)` (1H), the `CH₃(d)` group (3H), and the `CH₂` protons of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(g)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This proton would show a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) splitting pattern. **This matches the other required signal.**\n\nConclusion: Compound B is the only structure that has one proton (`H(b)`) that would produce a `dtt` signal and another proton (`H(c)`) that would produce a `dtq` signal. Therefore, it is the correct structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding (dimerization).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices. The absence of peaks in the vinyl region (around 1650 cm⁻¹ for C=C and 3010-3100 cm⁻¹ for =C-H) is also consistent with the NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is given by the `n+1` rule, where `n` is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, the splitting pattern becomes a \"multiplet of multiplets.\"\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It's coupled to a group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** It's coupled to a group of three neighboring protons (n=3).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different proton is also being split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** It's coupled to a group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Another Triplet (t):** It's coupled to another, different group of two neighboring protons (n=2).\n\nThese highly complex splitting patterns typically arise from methine protons (CH) in a complex, chiral environment.

The correct IUPAC name for the structure represented is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, found by identifying the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group.*\n    ```\n                   CH3(on C4)\n                   |\n    CH3-CH2(5)-CH(d)-CH(c)-CH2(2)-COOH\n                         |\n                         CH2CH3 (ethyl on C3)\n    ```\n    *   **Let's analyze the proton H(d) on carbon C4:**\n        *   It is coupled to H(c) on C3 (1 proton) -> **doublet**.\n        *   It is coupled to the CH2 group on C5 (2 protons) -> **triplet**.\n        *   It is coupled to the CH3 group on C4 (3 protons) -> **quartet**.\n        *   The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.

Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but doesn't help distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving the problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The \"n+1\" rule states that a proton signal is split into n+1 lines by n equivalent neighboring protons. A complex splitting pattern like \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" means a single proton is being coupled by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a **d**oublet, 1+1=2 lines).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n        *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **q**uartet, 3+1=4 lines).\n    *   For this to occur, a methine proton (-CH-) must be adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a **d**oublet, 1+1=2 lines).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n        *   Another different group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving another **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n    *   For this to occur, a methine proton (-CH-) must be adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a second, non-equivalent methylene group (-CH₂-).\n\nThe problem states that the compound's spectrum contains **both** of these signals. We must find the molecule that has two different protons matching these descriptions.\n\n### **3.

However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbours. The methine proton on C2 would be a doublet of triplets. Methylene protons in the ethyl groups would be complex multiplets (likely ddq's), but not a clean `dtq`.\n\n*   **Structure D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n    This is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `...-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(e)...`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-2 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` group of the terminal ethyl group (2H, triplet), and the methyl group substituent (3H, quartet).\n    *   This gives a `dtq` signal. However, similar to structure A, there is no environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Structure C: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    This corresponds to the structure **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's number the main chain starting from the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n    Structure:\n```\n           Et (ethyl on C3)\n           |\nHOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₅(from formula string)\n```\n    No, this naming is incorrect. Let's interpret the line formula `CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH` correctly.\n    It describes a pentanoic acid backbone with ethyl groups on carbons 3 and 4: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₃`.\n    Let's analyze the methine protons on carbons 3 and 4 of **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H-4):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₃` group at C5 (3H, gives a **quartet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C3 (1H, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H-4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H-3):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C4 (1H, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group at C2 (2H, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, gives another **triplet**).\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H-3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStructure C is the only candidate that possesses the necessary structural features to produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n    *   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This tells us there are no protons attached to sp² carbons of a C=C double bond. This is consistent with all four proposed structures, as none contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   **\"One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: According to the n+1 rule, this means a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to 2 adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   **Quartet (q)**: Coupled to 3 adjacent protons (a CH₃ group).\n    *   **\"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This means a different single proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d)**: Coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to 2 adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n        *   **Triplet (t)**: Coupled to another, non-equivalent set of 2 adjacent protons (another CH₂ group).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons (the CH methine protons) in each structure. We will number the carbon chains starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H's at C2 (2H, triplet), and its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This gives a **tdq** (or **dtq**). This matches one of the signals.\n    *   **H at C4**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the terminal CH₃ at C5 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqq**. This does not match the `dtt` signal. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C2**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq**.\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet). This gives a **dqt**. Neither signal matches the required `dtq` and `dtt` pair. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    The condensed formula `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` corresponds to 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid when the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group is identified.\n    Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    Let's analyze the key methine protons:\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H's at C2 (2H, triplet), and the H's on the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets). This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   **H at C4**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), H's at C5 (2H, triplet), and the H's of its methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets). This matches the other required signal.\n    *   Since this structure produces both the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals, it is the correct answer.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), H's at C4 (2H, triplet), and the H's of its ethyl group's CH₂ (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n    *   Are there any other protons that would give a `dtq`? The other methine proton is at C2. H at C2 is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet), giving a `dt`. There are no protons coupled to a CH, a CH₂, *and* a CH₃ group. Therefore, this structure cannot produce a `dtq` signal. So, D is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion**\n    Only the structure corresponding to option C, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, gives rise to both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum, matching the experimental data perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group class but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) described in the 1H NMR data.\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This confirms there are no C=C double bonds in the molecule, which is consistent with all four structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern arises when a single proton (or a set of equivalent protons) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (2+1=3).\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet (3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} set of neighbors. The order (dtq vs. tqd vs. qdt, etc.) depends on the relative sizes of the coupling constants (J-values), but the set of neighbors must be the same.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), giving a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving a **t**riplet.\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), giving another **t**riplet.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} set of neighbors.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the local environment of the methine (CH) protons in each structure to see if they match the required splitting patterns.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- of the ethyl group (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This is a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, which would produce a **dtq** (or tqd/qdt). This matches one signal.\n*   H at C2: Coupled to the H at C3 (1H), the -CH₃ on C2 (3H), and the -COOH proton (1H). This is a {1H, 3H, 1H} environment, which would produce a doublet of quartets of doublets (dqd). This does not match the `dtt` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**B) (CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the -CH₂- group (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This is a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, producing a **dtq**. This matches one signal.\n*   H at C4: Coupled to the H at C3 (1H) and the two -CH₃ groups of the isopropyl tail (6H). This is a {1H, 6H} environment, producing a doublet of septets. This does not match the `dtt` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   H at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- of the C4-ethyl group (2H), and the -CH₂- of its own C3-ethyl group (2H). This is a {1H, 2H, 2H} environment, which would produce a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n*   H at C2: Coupled to H at C3 (1H), the -CH₂- of its own C2-ethyl group (2H), and the -COOH proton (1H). This is a {1H, 2H, 1H} environment, which would produce a doublet of triplets of doublets (dtd). This does not match the `dtq` pattern.\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. Has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n**C) CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH**\nLet's analyze the structure based on the provided formula, assuming a backbone of `CH3-CH-CH-CH2-COOH`. Let's label the methine protons H_a and H_b.\n`CH₃ - CH_a(C₂H₅) - CH_b(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton H_a**: Let's identify its neighbors.\n    *   On the adjacent methyl group: 3 protons.\n    *   The adjacent methine proton: H_b (1 proton).\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group attached to its carbon: 2 protons.\n    *   The set of neighbors is **{3H, 1H, 2H}**. This will produce a **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**, which is a permutation of `dtq`. **This is a match.**\n\n*   **Proton H_b**: Let's identify its neighbors.\n    *   The adjacent methine proton: H_a (1 proton).\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) next to the carboxylic acid: 2 protons.\n    *   The methylene (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group attached to its carbon: 2 protons.\n    *   The set of neighbors is **{1H, 2H, 2H}**. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. **This is a match.**\n\n*   **Result:** Correct. This structure is the only one that possesses one proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} neighborhood (`dtq`) and a different proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighborhood (`dtt`).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the 1H NMR splitting patterns, compound C is the only candidate that matches the experimental data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. This broad peak typically overlaps with the C-H stretching absorptions.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all options but does not distinguish between them.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this information.\n    *   **Key Information**: The spectrum contains two particularly complex and revealing signals: a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt). These multiplicities arise from a proton's signal being split by neighboring, non-equivalent protons. The N+1 rule applies for each group of equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, gives a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives a triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (3H, gives a quartet).\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, gives a doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives a triplet), and another distinct group of two equivalent protons (2H, gives another triplet).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Potential Structure against the NMR Data:**\n    Let's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule. We will focus on the most complex signals, which come from the CH (methine) protons on the carbon backbone. Note that in molecules with chiral centers, adjacent CH₂ protons are often diastereotopic (non-equivalent), which can complicate splitting patterns (e.g., turning an expected triplet into a doublet of doublets). However, the given names (`dtq`, `dtt`) suggest that we can, at a first-order approximation, treat these as equivalent protons for splitting purposes, or that there is \"accidental equivalence\" where the coupling constants are very similar.\n\n    Let's write out the structures assuming linear depiction and standard IUPAC naming conventions:\n\n    *   **A) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet) and the two protons at C2 (2H, triplet). Expected signal: `dt`.\n        *   Proton at C4: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the three protons at C5 (3H, quartet). Expected signal: `dq`.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt` or `dtq`.\n\n    *   **B) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to protons at C2 (2H, `t`), proton at C4 (1H, `d`), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, `t`). Expected signal: `tdt`.\n        *   Proton at C4: Coupled to proton at C3 (1H, `d`), protons at C5 (3H, `q`), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, `t`). Expected signal: `dqt` (doublet of quartets of triplets). This is close to `dtq`, just different order.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt`. It has a `tdt` and a `dqt`.\n\n    *   **C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C2: Coupled only to H at C3 (1H, doublet). Expected signal: `d`.\n        *   Proton at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet) and the two protons at C4 (2H, triplet). Expected signal: `dt`.\n        *   This molecule does not produce a `dtt` or `dtq`.\n\n    *   **D) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid:**\n        `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Let's analyze the proton at **C3**. It is adjacent to three different carbons bearing protons:\n            1.  C2, which has one proton (H at C2). This will split the C3-proton signal into a **doublet**.\n            2.  C4, which has two protons (the CH₂ group). These will split the C3-proton signal into a **triplet**.\n            3.  The first carbon of the ethyl group attached to C3, which is also a CH₂ group with two protons. These will also split the C3-proton signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for the proton at C3 is expected to be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for one of the signals described in the problem.\n        *   Now let's look for the **`dtq`** signal. While there isn't a proton with the exact neighboring environment (adjacent to 1H, 2H, and 3H groups) to produce a simple `dtq`, let's examine the protons in one of the diastereotopic CH₂ groups. For instance, the CH₂ protons at C4. They are adjacent to the CH proton at C3 and the CH₃ protons at C5. Due to being next to a chiral center (C3) and having geminal coupling to each other, their signal would be a **doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq)**. A `ddq` is a complex multiplet that can, under certain conditions or lower resolution, be mistaken for or reported as a `dtq`. Given the definitive and rare `dtt` signal is perfectly explained by this structure, it is the most plausible candidate. No other option can account for the `dtt` signal.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The structure of 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid (D) is the only one that can produce a `dtt` signal for the proton on C3. This provides extremely strong evidence for its identity. The other signal, `dtq`, is likely a slightly simplified description of one of the `ddq` signals present in the molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nFirst, let's interpret the information from the characterization techniques.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group class but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). All four options are saturated molecules (containing only single bonds between carbons), so this is consistent with all of them.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises from a proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons. According to the n+1 rule:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1, multiplicity=1+1=2).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2, multiplicity=2+1=3).\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupling to 3 neighboring protons (n=3, multiplicity=3+1=4).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises from a proton coupled to:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n        *   **Another Triplet (t):** Coupling to a different group of 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in finding the single molecule that would produce *both* of these unique splitting patterns.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each of the proposed structures. The way the condensed formulas are written implies a sequential backbone.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - C(a)H(CH₃) - C(b)H(CH₃) - CH₂ - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(a) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ (2H), and its own CH₃ (3H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Other protons:** None of the other protons (H(a), CH₂, CH₃) are coupled to one proton, a group of two, and another group of two protons. Therefore, this molecule does not have a dtt signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - CH₂ - C(a)H(CH₃) - C(b)H(CH₃) - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(a):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ (2H), and its own CH₃ (3H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one signal.\n*   **Other protons:** Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (1H) and two different CH₃ groups (3H and 3H). This would give a doublet of quartets of quartets (or a doublet of septets if the methyls were equivalent). No proton in this molecule would produce a dtt signal.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`COOH - C(a)H(C₂H₅) - C(b)H(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - CH₃`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(a) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ of the main chain (2H), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Other protons:** We now need to find a dtq signal (a proton coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors). Let's check the methylene protons. The -CH₂- protons in the main chain are coupled to H(b) (1H) and the terminal -CH₃ (3H). They would give a doublet of quartets (dq). The -CH₂- protons within the ethyl groups are also coupled to one methine proton (H(a) or H(b)) and one methyl group, which would also result in a dq. Therefore, this molecule does not have a dtq signal.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's analyze the structure as written: a backbone of `C-C-C-C-COOH` with specified substituents.\n`CH₃(a) - C(b)H(C₂H₅) - C(e)H(C₂H₅) - C(h)H₂ - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    1.  The CH₃(a) group (3 protons) → creates a **quartet**.\n    2.  The methine proton H(e) (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n    3.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(e):** This proton also has three different neighboring groups of protons:\n    1.  The methine proton H(b) (1 proton) → creates a **doublet**.\n    2.  The CH₂(h) group (2 protons) → creates a **triplet**.\n    3.  The CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2 protons) → creates another **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nCompound C is the only candidate that possesses protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR data. It has one proton environment that results in a dtq signal and a different proton environment that results in a dtt signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
