This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group is present. The general formula for an ester is R-COO-R'. This group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum data:**\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, likely a para (1,4) substitution, which would give two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This confirms the C6H4 fragment, contributing 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic indicator of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`, attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring).\n        *   Let's analyze the protons: `(Aryl)-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is split by `H(b)` into a doublet.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is split by `H(a)` (a doublet) and the three protons of the `-CH3` group (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and (1+1+3) = 5 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) we just identified. The second methyl group must belong to the ester substituent.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. The ester group cannot be, for example, `-COOCH2CH3` or `-CH2COOCH3` as these would produce `-CH2-` signals. The only simple ester structure containing a methyl group and no methylene group is a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`. This fragment contributes 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular formula from the identified fragments:**\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C6H4\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C3H5 (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Methyl Ester Group):** C2H3O2 (`-COOCH3`)\n\n4.  **Sum the atoms from all fragments:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n5.  **Final Molecular Formula:** The deduced formula is C11H12O2.\n\n6.  **Verify with the provided options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option B. The python code execution also confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structural information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core of this part of the molecule is C6H4. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals for aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern, where the four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent in two sets of two.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR information:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the general structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (-COO-).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectral data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six different types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** As mentioned, this corresponds to the four protons on the C6H4 ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very specific and informative splitting pattern. A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) arises when a proton is split by one adjacent proton (giving a doublet) and also by three adjacent protons of a methyl group (giving a quartet). A \"doublet\" (d) arises when a proton is split by only one adjacent proton. This pattern strongly indicates the presence of a propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is adjacent to H(a) and the -CH3 group. It will be split into a doublet by H(a) and a quartet by the -CH3 group, resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is adjacent only to H(b). It will be split into a **doublet**.\n        *   This fragment perfectly matches the description. The formula for this propenyl group is C3H5 (2 vinyl H + 3 methyl H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified one -CH3 group from the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 signal must come from the other substituent.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It tells us that there are no methylene bridges in the molecule.\n\n4.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   We have a C6H4 ring.\n    *   We have a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) as one substituent.\n    *   The other substituent is an ester that must contain the second -CH3 group but no -CH2 groups. Let's consider the possibilities for an ester R-COO-R':\n        *   If the ester is attached to the ring through the carbonyl carbon (e.g., a substituted methyl benzoate), the R' part must be the methyl group to avoid a -CH2-. The substituent would be **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains one -CH3 group and no -CH2 groups. This fits.\n        *   If the ester is attached to the ring through the oxygen (e.g., a substituted phenyl acetate), the R part must be the methyl group to avoid a -CH2-. The substituent would be **-O-CO-CH3**. This fragment also contains one -CH3 group and no -CH2 groups. This also fits.\n    *   Both possibilities for the ester substituent have the same atomic composition: C2H3O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    *   Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n        *   Propenyl substituent: C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3)\n        *   Ester substituent: C2H3O2 (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3)\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C12H14O2\n    *   D) C11H12O2\n    *   Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D. The other formulas are inconsistent with the spectral data. For example, C11H14O2 and C12H14O2 have more hydrogen atoms, which would imply fewer double bonds or rings, contradicting the presence of both an aromatic ring and a vinyl group. C12H12O2 has an extra carbon atom that cannot be accounted for without violating the \"no -CH2 groups\" or \"di-substituted\" rules.\n\nTherefore, based on a logical deduction from the provided spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by each spectroscopic technique.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group is noted. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and two oxygen atoms. All the given formula options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) contain two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 aromatic protons.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n    *   **Six signals:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, such as para (1,4-substitution), which would give two signals (two doublets), each integrating to 2H. This is consistent with the C6H4 core.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This fragment contains one C=C double bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group's signal is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group. Since the problem states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**, it cannot be part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). Therefore, it must be a methyl group directly attached to the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH3). In either case, this methyl group is isolated and would appear as a singlet.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate several possibilities.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\nFrom the spectral data, we can sum the expected DBE:\n*   Aromatic ring: 1 ring + 3 π-bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given formulas using the formula: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 (for a compound with formula CxHyO2).\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. (Incorrect)\n*   **B) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. (Incorrect)\n*   **D) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n\nThis analysis eliminates options A and C. We are left with C12H14O2 and C11H12O2.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Molecular Structure and Final Verification\n\nLet's build the molecule from the fragments we've identified from the NMR data:\n1.  A di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4** (contributes 4H)\n2.  A propenyl group substituent: **-CH=CH-CH3** (contributes C3H5)\n3.  An ester substituent containing a methyl group, e.g., a methyl carboxylate group (**-COOCH3**, contributes C2H3O2) or an acetoxy group (**-OCOCH3**, contributes C2H3O2).\n\nLet's assemble these pieces and sum the atoms. For example, a possible structure is methyl 4-propenylbenzoate:\n*   **C atoms:** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from COOCH3) = **11 carbons**\n*   **H atoms:** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from COOCH3) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **O atoms:** 2 (from COOCH3) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting formula is **C11H12O2**. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data:\n*   It has the correct DBE of 6.\n*   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   It has an ester group.\n*   It contains a propenyl group giving the characteristic vinyl signals.\n*   It has two distinct methyl groups.\n*   It contains no CH2 groups.\n*   The total proton count (12H) matches the formula.\n\nNow, let's consider the other possibility, **C12H14O2**.\n*   This formula has the correct DBE of 6.\n*   However, compared to C11H12O2, it has one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (a \"CH2\" unit).\n*   To incorporate a CH2 unit into our proposed structure would create a -CH2- signal in the NMR spectrum.\n*   The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**.\n*   Furthermore, if we analyze the proton count for C12H14O2: Total H = 14. Aromatic H = 4. Vinyl H = 2. This leaves 14 - 4 - 2 = 8 protons. These 8 protons would have to be distributed among methyl groups (since CH2 is forbidden), which is impossible as 8 is not a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, the formula C12H14O2 is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the constraints from the FTIR and 1H NMR data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR:** The problem states that the FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. An ester group has the general formula R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) have two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with this information.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify Structural Fragments and Proton Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. Two signals for the aromatic protons typically suggest a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly a 1,4- (para-) disubstituted benzene ring. A para-substituted ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6**H4**), which appear as two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system, often simplified to two doublets). Thus, we have **4 aromatic protons**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** There are two signals for vinyl protons (protons on a C=C double bond). One is a doublet (d) and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (each peak of the doublet becomes a quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets (dq). This accounts for **1 vinyl proton**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This accounts for the second **1 vinyl proton**.\n    *   **–CH3 Groups (2 signals):** There are two signals for methyl groups.\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-**CH3**), which accounts for **3 protons**.\n        *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Since the problem states there are no –CH2 groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (e.g., -COO**CH3**) or an acetate ester (e.g., -O-CO-**CH3**). Both contain a methyl group, which accounts for another **3 protons**.\n    *   **No –CH2 Groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a -CH2- unit.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    Based on the NMR analysis, we can sum the number of protons in the molecule:\n    Total H = (Aromatic H) + (Vinyl H) + (Methyl H)\n    Total H = 4 + (1 + 1) + (3 + 3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n\n4.  **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**\n    The molecular formula must contain 12 hydrogen atoms. Let's look at the options:\n    A) C12H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    B) C11H14O2 (14 H) - **Eliminated**\n    C) C11H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    D) C12H14O2 (14 H) - **Eliminated**\n    We are now left with two choices: C12H12O2 and C11H12O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Carbon Atoms:**\n    Now, let's assemble the fragments we've identified and count the carbon atoms:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring (**C6**H4) contributes **6 carbons**.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The -CH=CH-CH3 group contributes **3 carbons**.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The ester group containing a methyl group, either -**C**OO**C**H3 or -O**C**O**C**H3, contributes **2 carbons**.\n\n    Total C = (Ring C) + (Propenyl C) + (Ester C)\n    Total C = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11 carbons**.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Chemical Formula:**\n    Based on our analysis, the molecule contains 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms.\n    The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n7.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE for C11H12O2 is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    The proposed structure contains:\n    *   One benzene ring (4 DBEs)\n    *   One C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 DBE)\n    *   One C=O double bond in the ester group (1 DBE)\n    Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The calculated DBE matches the structural features deduced from the spectra, confirming our conclusion.\n\nComparing our result with the remaining options, C11H12O2 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Substituent (Ester Group):**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, which has the general structure R-COO-R'.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum provides a crucial clue: \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\" This rules out common ester types like ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl esters, as they contain -CH2- groups.\n    *   The simplest ester that does not have a -CH2- group is a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n    *   The presence of a methyl ester is consistent with the 1H NMR data, which shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". One of these signals would be from the methyl ester's -CH3 group.\n    *   So, the first substituent is a methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains **2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Substituent:**\n    *   We need to account for the remaining signals in the 1H NMR spectrum. We have already accounted for one -CH3 signal. The remaining signals are:\n        *   Two signals for aromatic-H (these are on the C6H4 ring itself).\n        *   Two signals for vinyl-H (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   One more signal for a -CH3 group.\n    *   The vinyl-H signals are described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\". This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n        *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3(c) group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The signal for H(a) is split only by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   The signal for the CH3(c) group is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet. This accounts for the second -CH3 signal.\n    *   This -CH=CH-CH3 group perfectly matches the NMR description. This fragment contains **3 carbons and 5 hydrogens**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   Now, we combine all the identified parts of the molecule:\n        *   Aromatic ring: **C6H4**\n        *   First substituent (methyl ester): **C2H3O2** (from -COOCH3)\n        *   Second substituent (propenyl group): **C3H5** (from -CH=CH-CH3)\n    *   Sum the atoms from all fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 2 + 3 = 11\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 3 + 5 = 12\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound from the given spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Information**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which can be represented as a C6H4 group.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the proposed formulas. An ester group also contains a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It rules out groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6**H4**). Two signals for these 4 protons typically indicate a para-substitution pattern with two different substituents, resulting in two doublets (an AA'BB' system). This fragment accounts for **C6** and **H4**.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   Let's label the protons: `(A)H-C=C(B)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton (A) is adjacent to only proton (B), so its signal would be a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   Proton (B) is adjacent to proton (A) (1H) and the methyl group (3H). According to the n+1 rule, it will be split into a doublet by proton (A) and a quartet by the -CH3 group. This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This fragment is `-CH=CH-CH3` and accounts for **C3** and **H5** (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl proton.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since there are no -CH2- groups, this methyl group is likely part of the ester, forming a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this fragment adds a **-CH3** group, accounting for **H3**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula**\n\nLet's sum up the atoms from the fragments we have deduced:\n\n*   **From the aromatic ring:** C6H4\n*   **From the vinyl and first methyl groups:** A propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This has C3H5.\n*   **From the ester and the second methyl group:** We need an ester (`-COO-`) and a methyl group (`-CH3`). The most logical combinations that don't introduce a CH2 group are a methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n    *   If the substituent is `-COOCH3`, it contributes C2H3O2.\n    *   If the substituent is `-O-CO-CH3`, it contributes C2H3O2.\n\nLet's build a complete molecule. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring must be the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n\n*   **Structure 1:** `(propenyl group)`-C6H4-`(methyl carboxylate group)` -> `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3`\n*   **Structure 2:** `(propenyl group)`-C6H4-`(acetoxy group)` -> `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3`\n\nNow, let's calculate the total molecular formula for either of these possible structures:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester/acetate part) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester/acetate part) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated formula is C11H12O2. Let's compare this with the given choices:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nOur derived formula matches option C.\n\nTo be certain, we can quickly re-check the hydrogen and carbon counts from the NMR data alone:\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (methyl 1) + 3 (methyl 2) = 12 H. This eliminates options A (14 H) and D (14 H).\n*   **Total Carbons:** 6 (aromatic ring) + 2 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (methyl C) + 1 (second methyl C) + 1 (ester C=O) = 11 C. This eliminates option B (12 C).\n\nBoth methods of analysis consistently lead to the same formula.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains one carbonyl (C=O) and one C-O bond. It has a molecular formula fragment of -CO2-.\n*   **General Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring with two other groups attached to it. The core of this ring is C6H4.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests a substitution pattern like ortho (1,2-disubstituted) or para (1,4-disubstituted). In either case, we have a C6H4 group.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic and very informative splitting pattern. It strongly suggests the presence of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by the adjacent H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (giving a quartet). The combination results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is split only by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment, which has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl signals belongs to the `-CH=CH-CH3` group we just identified. Therefore, there must be a second, distinct `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we have the following pieces of the molecule:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n*   An ester group: `-COO-`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n*   A methyl group: `-CH3`\n\nNow, we must assemble these fragments into a valid chemical structure that is consistent with all the data. The ester group must link two parts of the molecule. There are two primary ways the benzene ring can be part of an ester:\n\n*   **Case A: Methyl Benzoate derivative:** The ring is attached to the carbonyl part of the ester (`C6H4-COO-R`). The two substituents on the ring would be the propenyl group and the ester group itself. R would be the remaining fragment, which is a methyl group (`-CH3`). However, the NMR specifies *two* -CH3 signals, one from the propenyl group and one other. This would only provide one -CH3 signal from the propenyl group and one from the ester's methyl group, which seems to fit. Let's reconsider. The question says there are two signals corresponding to `-CH3` groups. Our fragments are C6H4, COO, -CH=CH-CH3, and -CH3. It seems more likely the two substituents on the ring are -CH3 and something else.\n\nLet's try a different assembly. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are a methyl group (`-CH3`) and the ester group.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 1: Propenyl methylbenzoate**\n    *   Let's place the `-CH3` group and the ester group onto the benzene ring. This gives a `CH3-C6H4-COO-` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragment is the propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This group must be attached to the oxygen of the ester.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH3-C6H4-COO-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   This structure fits all the NMR data: two aromatic signals (possible for ortho/para), vinyl signals for `-O-CH=CH-CH3`, two distinct -CH3 signals (one on the ring, one on the vinyl group), and no -CH2 groups.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 2: Methyl propenylbenzoate**\n    *   Let's place the `-CH=CH-CH3` group and the ester group onto the ring. This gives a `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-COO-` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragment is the methyl group, `-CH3`. This must be attached to the ester oxygen.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-COOCH3`.\n    *   This structure also fits all the NMR data: two aromatic signals, vinyl signals for `Ar-CH=CH-CH3`, two distinct -CH3 signals (one on the vinyl group, one from the methyl ester), and no -CH2 groups.\n\n**3. Calculate the Chemical Formula**\n\nBoth plausible structures are isomers and should have the same chemical formula. Let's calculate it for the first structure (`CH3-C6H4-COO-CH=CH-CH3`):\n*   **Carbons (C):** 1 (from methyl on ring) + 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 3 (from propenyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 3 (from methyl on ring) + 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** This would require adding a carbon atom without changing the hydrogen count, which is not possible with simple organic groups. It would disrupt the structure that fits the NMR data.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** To get this formula from C11H12O2, one must add a `CH2` group. The problem statement explicitly says there are no signals for `-CH2` groups. This option is incorrect.\n*   **D) C11H14O2:** This formula has two more hydrogens than our derived structure. To add two hydrogens, we would need to remove a double bond. However, the NMR data clearly shows a `C=C` double bond (vinyl protons). This option contradicts the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly aligns with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core formula for this part is C6H4.\n    *   The aromatic nature implies 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An \"ester group\" is present. An ester has the structure R-COO-R', which contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This accounts for one more degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many possibilities. For example, we cannot have ethyl, propyl, or butyl groups in their standard forms.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4-disubstitution (para). This confirms the C6H4 part. Total protons so far: 4.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring. Let's analyze the coupling:\n        *   Structure: `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is adjacent to `H(b)`, so its signal is split into a **doublet**.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is adjacent to `H(a)` (causing a doublet split) and also to the three protons of the methyl group (causing a quartet split). The resulting signal is a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, -C3H5. This group adds 1 degree of unsaturation (the C=C double bond). Total protons from this group: 1+1+3 = 5.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** The NMR spectrum shows two distinct methyl group signals.\n        *   One methyl signal belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified.\n        *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-O-CO-CH3).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's assemble the identified parts to build the whole molecule.\n    *   **Fragment 1:** The di-substituted aromatic ring: **C6H4**.\n    *   **Fragment 2:** The propenyl group: **-C3H5**.\n    *   **Fragment 3:** The ester group part containing the second methyl group.\n        *   If it's a methyl ester group attached to the ring: -COOCH3. The formula for this fragment is **-C2H3O2**.\n        *   If it's an acetate group attached to the ring: -O-CO-CH3. The formula for this fragment is also **-C2H3O2**.\n    *   Both possibilities for the ester group fragment have the same formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify the Formula:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Let's check if our proposed structure has 6 DoU: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (propenyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = 6. The DoU matches.\n    *   The formula C11H12O2 corresponds to option C. Other options like C12H14O2 or C11H14O2 would imply the presence of CH2 groups or a different degree of unsaturation, which contradicts the given data. C12H12O2 was shown in the thought process to be inconsistent with the number of vinyl signals.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **FTIR:** The presence of an ester group is confirmed. An ester functional group contains the structure R-COO-R' and has two oxygen atoms. This means the molecular formula must end in O2. All four options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) satisfy this condition.\n\n    *   **Molecular Structure Core:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This implies a benzene ring with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula of this part of the molecule is C6H4.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means we can eliminate any proposed structure that contains a methylene (-CH2-) group. This rules out substituents like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or allyl (-CH2CH=CH2).\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** The compound has two distinct types of methyl groups.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically `–CH=CH–CH3`.\n            *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n            *   This group contributes `C3H5` to the formula and accounts for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n        *   **Putting it together:** Since one –CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group, the second –CH3 signal must belong to the ester. Given the \"no –CH2\" rule, the ester must be a methyl ester (`–COOCH3`), not an ethyl or larger ester. This group contributes `CO2CH3` to the formula.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) with two different substituents in a para (1,4) arrangement would give two signals (two doublets), consistent with this description.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Deduced Structure:**\n\n    We have the following components:\n    *   A benzene ring core: `C6H4`\n    *   A propenyl group substituent: `–C3H5`\n    *   A methyl ester substituent: `–COOCH3`\n\n    Combining these parts gives the molecule methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\n    Let's sum the atoms from the assembled structure:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 1 (from –CO–) + 1 (from –OCH3) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from –OCH3) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\n    The DBE (or index of hydrogen deficiency) can be used as a check.\n    *   **From spectral data:** Aromatic ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds) = 4 DBE. Ester C=O group = 1 DBE. Vinyl C=C group = 1 DBE. Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   **From the derived formula (C11H12O2):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    The DBE calculation is consistent.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (DBE = 12 + 1 - 14/2 = 6)\n    *   B) C11H12O2 (DBE = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6)\n    *   C) C12H12O2 (DBE = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7)\n    *   D) C11H14O2 (DBE = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5)\n\n    *   Option D is incorrect because its DBE of 5 is too low to accommodate an aromatic ring, an ester, and a vinyl group.\n    *   Option C is incorrect because its DBE of 7 implies an extra ring or double bond for which there is no evidence in the NMR data.\n    *   This leaves options A and B. To get from B (C11H12O2) to A (C12H14O2), one must add a `CH2` unit. As established from the NMR data, the molecule contains no `–CH2–` groups. Therefore, option A is impossible.\n\n    The only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence is **C11H12O2**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct chemical formula for a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectral data. Let's break down the information provided step-by-step to deduce the structure and its formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectral data:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents, which means the core has the formula -C6H4-. A benzene ring contributes 4 units to the degree of unsaturation (DoU) (one for the ring itself and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group. An ester functional group contains a carbonyl (C=O) and a C-O single bond. The carbonyl group contributes 1 unit to the DoU. So far, the required DoU is 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) = 5.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum - Six Signals:**\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** In a di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4), there are 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals implies symmetry. This pattern is characteristic of a para (1,4)-substituted benzene ring, where the two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are equivalent, giving rise to two signals (often two doublets).\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** These are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This C=C bond adds another unit to the DoU, bringing the total to 6.\n            *   Signal 1: A doublet. This indicates the proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n            *   Signal 2: A doublet of quartets. This indicates the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group, giving the quartet).\n            *   This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring). Let's call the ring `Ar`. In the structure `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`, H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet. H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and this doublet is further split by the -CH3 group into quartets, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment accounts for one C=C double bond, two vinyl protons, and one -CH3 group. The formula of this fragment is **-C3H5**.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group described above. The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester functionality.\n        *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that restricts the possible structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure and determine the formula:**\n    *   We have the para-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**.\n    *   We have the propenyl substituent: **-C3H5**.\n    *   We have an ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3). The absence of -CH2- signals means the methyl group must be directly attached to the carbonyl (acetate ester, Ar-O-CO-CH3) or the ester oxygen (methyl ester, Ar-COOCH3). Both possibilities lead to the same fragment count. Let's assume a methyl ester substituent: **-COOCH3**. This fragment has the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result against the given options:**\n    *   The derived formula C11H12O2 matches option A.\n    *   Let's check the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2. DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6. This matches our structural analysis: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (C=C in propenyl) + 1 (C=O in ester) = 6.\n    *   Now, let's briefly consider the other options:\n        *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 5. This would mean no C=C double bond in the side chain, which contradicts the vinyl-H signals.\n        *   C) C12H12O2: DoU = 7. This requires an additional double bond or ring, for which there is no evidence.\n        *   D) C12H14O2: DoU = 6. This formula has the same DoU as option A, but differs by a CH2 unit. Since the NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, this option is ruled out.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe user wants me to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on several pieces of spectroscopic data.

We have already accounted for these 4 hydrogens.\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl-H are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   A signal that is a \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) is highly characteristic of a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to both another proton on the double bond and a methyl group. This points strongly to a propenyl group fragment: **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's verify the splitting: The H atom on the carbon next to the CH3 group (`=CH-CH3`) is split by the other vinyl H (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3 group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl H (`-CH=`) is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet.

The C=O bond in the ester adds 1 DOU.\n    *   **1H NMR signals**:\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests an ortho or meta substitution pattern with different substituents, or a para substitution. This is consistent with the C6H4 core.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a group with no protons on the adjacent atom (like the aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's label the group: Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   The signal for H(a) is split only by H(b), so it appears as a doublet.\n            *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) (giving a doublet) and by the three protons of the -CH3 group (giving a quartet). The resulting signal is a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, -C3H5. This group also contains a C=C double bond, which adds 1 DOU.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: One -CH3 group is accounted for by the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3). The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or have any other alkyl chain longer than a methyl group. Combined with the presence of a second -CH3 signal, this strongly points to the ester being either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3). In both cases, this fragment has the formula C2H3O2.\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula.**\n    *   Aromatic core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): -CH=CH-CH3, which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester part): -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3, both having the formula C2H3O2.\n    *   Now, we sum the atoms from these parts to find the total molecular formula:\n        *   Carbon atoms: 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (from ester) = 2 oxygens.\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify the result by checking the Degrees of Unsaturation (DOU).**\n    *   The structural features identified are: 1 benzene ring (4 DOU), 1 C=C double bond (1 DOU), and 1 C=O double bond (1 DOU).\n    *   Total expected DOU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's calculate the DOU from the derived formula, C11H12O2, using the formula DOU = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   DOU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The calculated DOU matches the expected DOU from the structure, confirming our assignment.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare the derived formula with the given options.**\n    *   A) C12H12O2 (DOU = 7)\n    *   B) C11H14O2 (DOU = 5)\n    *   C) C11H12O2 (DOU = 6)\n    *   D) C12H14O2 (DOU = 6)\n    *   Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. The other options are inconsistent. For instance, C12H14O2 has the correct DOU, but building a molecule with that formula that also matches the NMR data (no CH2, only two CH3 signals) is not possible. Adding a CH3 to C11H12O2 would necessitate removing an H, creating C12H14O2, but would result in three CH3 signals, which contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula options.\n    *   **Structure Core:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. The base formula for the ring itself, after substitution, is C6H4, assuming the two substituents replace two hydrogen atoms. The 1H NMR data, showing two signals for aromatic hydrogens, strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern, which would have this C6H4 core.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR signals:** The spectrum shows six signals in total. Let's identify the groups responsible for these signals.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This corresponds to the 4 protons on the di-substituted benzene ring (C6**H4**). A 1,4-disubstituted ring would give two signals for two protons each (typically two doublets), which fits this description.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a C=C double bond outside the aromatic ring.\n        *   Signal 1: A doublet.\n        *   Signal 2: A doublet of quartets.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton (giving a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals belongs to the methyl group of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) group we just identified. This methyl group's signal would be a doublet due to splitting by the adjacent vinyl proton.\n        *   The second –CH3 signal must belong to another part of the molecule. Since we know there's an ester, this is likely a methyl group attached to the ester, either as a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, it's a **CH3** group. This signal would appear as a singlet as it has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl (other than propenyl), or other methylene-containing chains in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular structure and determine the formula:**\n    Let's assemble the pieces we have identified:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**\n    *   A propenyl substituent: **C3H5**\n    *   An ester group containing a methyl group. Let's analyze the two possibilities for the ester substituent:\n        *   Possibility A: A methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n        *   Possibility B: An acetoxy group, `-OCOCH3`. This also has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms from the core (C6H4) and the two substituents (the C3H5 group and the C2H3O2 group) to find the total molecular formula.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl of ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU formula is `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`.\n    For C11H12O2, DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    Let's check the DoU from the proposed structure:\n    *   1 for the benzene ring.\n    *   3 for the double bonds within the benzene ring.\n    *   1 for the vinyl C=C double bond.\n    *   1 for the ester C=O double bond.\n    *   Total DoU = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The DoU matches, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D. The other options are incorrect:\n    *   C12H14O2 and C12H12O2 have the wrong carbon count.\n    *   C11H14O2 has too many hydrogens, which would mean a lower degree of unsaturation (DoU = 5), contradicting the presence of the aromatic ring, a vinyl group, and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Furthermore, any option with more than 12 hydrogens or containing a -CH2- unit would contradict the NMR data. For example, C11H14O2 would likely arise from reducing the C=C bond of the propenyl group to a C-C bond (propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3), but this would eliminate the vinyl signals and introduce two CH2 signals.\n\nTherefore, the only possible formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically piecing together the information from the provided spectra.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Determine the Number of Hydrogens and Structural Fragments:**\n\n*   **Aromatic-H signals (2 signals):** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring) has 4 protons on the ring itself (formula C6H4). The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents, which would give a characteristic AA'BB' system, often appearing as two distinct signals (doublets).\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **4 H** (aromatic)\n\n*   **Vinyl-H signals (2 signals, one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   Let's label the carbons: Ring-CH(A)=CH(B)-CH3(C).\n    *   H(B) is split by H(A) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   H(A) is only split by H(B), resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons.\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **2 H** (vinyl)\n\n*   **–CH3 group signals (2 signals):**\n    *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group is adjacent to a vinyl proton (H(B)), so its signal would be a doublet.\n    *   The other -CH3 signal must belong to the second substituent, the ester group. Since there are no adjacent protons, this would be a singlet.\n    *   These two methyl groups account for 2 * 3 = 6 protons.\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **6 H** (methyl)\n\n*   **No –CH2 group signals:** This is a key constraint that eliminates many possibilities.\n\n**2. Sum the Hydrogens:**\n\nBy adding up the protons from all the identified fragments, we can determine the total number of hydrogens in the molecule.\nTotal H = 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = **12 H**\n\nNow, we can compare this with the options provided:\nA) C11H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\nB) C12H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\nC) C11H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**.\nD) C12H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**.\n\nThis analysis narrows the choice down to C or D.\n\n**3. Determine the Carbon Count:**\n\nLet's build the molecule's carbon skeleton based on the fragments we identified.\n*   **Di-substituted benzene ring:** This is a C6H4 fragment, so **6 Carbons**.\n*   **Propenyl group:** The -CH=CH-CH3 group has **3 Carbons**.\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-), which contains one C=O bond. The second methyl group must be part of this ester. There are two possibilities that fit the \"no -CH2\" rule:\n    1.  A methyl ester: -COOCH3. This contains **2 Carbons** (the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon).\n    2.  An acetate group attached via oxygen: -O-CO-CH3. This also contains **2 Carbons**.\nIn either case, this fragment contributes 2 carbons.\n\n**4. Sum the Carbons:**\n\nTotal C = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester fragment) = **11 C**\n\n**5. Final Identification:**\n\nThe molecule must have 11 carbons and 12 hydrogens. The only formula that matches this is **C11H12O2**. The two oxygens are from the ester group.\n\nTo confirm, let's check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\nOur proposed structure has:\n*   1 benzene ring = 4 DoU\n*   1 C=C double bond (in propenyl) = 1 DoU\n*   1 C=O double bond (in ester) = 1 DoU\n*   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated DoU matches the DoU derived from the structure, confirming our analysis. The chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a C6H4 benzene core with two substituents.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum (6 signals total):**\n        *   **2 signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals is characteristic of certain substitution patterns, like para-substitution (which would give an AA'BB' system, often appearing as two distinct signals/doublets). Total H count from this part is 4.\n        *   **2 signals for vinyl-H (C=CH):** One signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern is highly indicative of a propenyl group, specifically the `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment.\n            *   Let's label the protons: `Ring-C(Ha)=C(Hb)-CH3`.\n            *   Proton `Ha` is adjacent to one proton (`Hb`), so it would appear as a **doublet**. This matches the data.\n            *   Proton `Hb` is adjacent to one proton (`Ha`) and three equivalent protons of the methyl group. This coupling would split the signal into a **doublet of quartets**. This perfectly matches the data.\n            *   Therefore, one of the substituents contains a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. This fragment has 2 vinyl protons.\n        *   **2 signals for -CH3 groups:**\n            *   One of these methyl groups is the one from the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This methyl group is adjacent to the `Hb` vinyl proton, so it would appear as a doublet.\n            *   The second methyl group must be located elsewhere in the molecule. Given the presence of an ester and the constraint of \"no -CH2- groups\", the most likely position for this methyl is as the alkyl part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or the acetyl part of a phenyl acetate-type ester (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this methyl group would be a singlet as it has no adjacent protons.\n            *   This confirms the presence of two distinct methyl groups.\n        *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a key constraint that confirms our proposed fragments, as neither a propenyl group, a methyl ester group, nor a phenyl acetate-type group contain any `-CH2-` (methylene) units.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure from the fragments:**\n    *   **Core:** C6H4 (di-substituted benzene ring).\n    *   **Substituent 1:** `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl group).\n    *   **Substituent 2:** An ester group containing a methyl group, e.g., `-COOCH3` (methyl ester group).\n    *   Let's check if this structure (a propenyl methylbenzoate) fits all the data.\n        *   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   It contains an ester.\n        *   The NMR signals match perfectly (2 aromatic, 2 vinyl, 2 methyl).\n        *   It has no -CH2- groups.\n        *   The total number of 1H NMR signals would be 2 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 6 signals. This matches the given information.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of protons:**\n    *   From the ring (C6H4): 4 H\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 H\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 3 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 H.\n    *   This immediately eliminates options with H14 (A and D). We are left with B (C12H12O2) and C (C11H12O2).\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of Carbon and Oxygen atoms:**\n    *   From the ring (C6H4): 6 C\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 C\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 1 C (from C=O) + 1 C (from O-CH3) = 2 C\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2 O\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 C.\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2 O.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Chemical Formula:**\n    *   Based on the atom count, the chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify with other possibilities and Degree of Unsaturation (DBU):**\n    *   The alternative ester structure, propenyl phenyl acetate (`CH3CO-O-C6H4-CH=CHCH3`), also gives the formula C11H12O2. So regardless of the exact isomer, the formula is the same.\n    *   The DBU for C11H12O2 is `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6`. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 DBUs), one C=C double bond (1 DBU), and one C=O double bond (1 DBU).\n    *   The formula C12H12O2 would have a DBU of 7. It is not possible to add another DBU (e.g., another ring or double bond) and an extra Carbon to our structure without violating the strict NMR rules provided.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group is present. The general formula for an ester is R-COO-R'. This group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum data:**\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, likely a para (1,4) substitution, which would give two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This confirms the C6H4 fragment, contributing 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic indicator of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`, attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring).\n        *   Let's analyze the protons: `(Aryl)-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is split by `H(b)` into a doublet.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is split by `H(a)` (a doublet) and the three protons of the `-CH3` group (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and (1+1+3) = 5 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) we just identified. The second methyl group must belong to the ester substituent.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. The ester group cannot be, for example, `-COOCH2CH3` or `-CH2COOCH3` as these would produce `-CH2-` signals. The only simple ester structure containing a methyl group and no methylene group is a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`. This fragment contributes 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular formula from the identified fragments:**\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C6H4\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C3H5 (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Methyl Ester Group):** C2H3O2 (`-COOCH3`)\n\n4.  **Sum the atoms from all fragments:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n5.  **Final Molecular Formula:** The deduced formula is C11H12O2.\n\n6.  **Verify with the provided options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option B. The python code execution also confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structural information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core of this part of the molecule is C6H4. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals for aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern, where the four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent in two sets of two.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR information:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the general structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (-COO-).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectral data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six different types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** As mentioned, this corresponds to the four protons on the C6H4 ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very specific and informative splitting pattern. A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) arises when a proton is split by one adjacent proton (giving a doublet) and also by three adjacent protons of a methyl group (giving a quartet). A \"doublet\" (d) arises when a proton is split by only one adjacent proton. This pattern strongly indicates the presence of a propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is adjacent to H(a) and the -CH3 group. It will be split into a doublet by H(a) and a quartet by the -CH3 group, resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is adjacent only to H(b). It will be split into a **doublet**.\n        *   This fragment perfectly matches the description. The formula for this propenyl group is C3H5 (2 vinyl H + 3 methyl H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified one -CH3 group from the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 signal must come from the other substituent.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It tells us that there are no methylene bridges in the molecule.\n\n4.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   We have a C6H4 ring.\n    *   We have a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) as one substituent.\n    *   The other substituent is an ester that must contain the second -CH3 group but no -CH2 groups. Let's consider the possibilities for an ester R-COO-R':\n        *   If the ester is attached to the ring through the carbonyl carbon (e.g., a substituted methyl benzoate), the R' part must be the methyl group to avoid a -CH2-. The substituent would be **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains one -CH3 group and no -CH2 groups. This fits.\n        *   If the ester is attached to the ring through the oxygen (e.g., a substituted phenyl acetate), the R part must be the methyl group to avoid a -CH2-. The substituent would be **-O-CO-CH3**. This fragment also contains one -CH3 group and no -CH2 groups. This also fits.\n    *   Both possibilities for the ester substituent have the same atomic composition: C2H3O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    *   Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n        *   Propenyl substituent: C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3)\n        *   Ester substituent: C2H3O2 (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3)\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C12H14O2\n    *   D) C11H12O2\n    *   Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D. The other formulas are inconsistent with the spectral data. For example, C11H14O2 and C12H14O2 have more hydrogen atoms, which would imply fewer double bonds or rings, contradicting the presence of both an aromatic ring and a vinyl group. C12H12O2 has an extra carbon atom that cannot be accounted for without violating the \"no -CH2 groups\" or \"di-substituted\" rules.\n\nTherefore, based on a logical deduction from the provided spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by each spectroscopic technique.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group is noted. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and two oxygen atoms. All the given formula options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) contain two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 aromatic protons.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n    *   **Six signals:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, such as para (1,4-substitution), which would give two signals (two doublets), each integrating to 2H. This is consistent with the C6H4 core.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This fragment contains one C=C double bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group's signal is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group. Since the problem states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**, it cannot be part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). Therefore, it must be a methyl group directly attached to the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH3). In either case, this methyl group is isolated and would appear as a singlet.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate several possibilities.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\nFrom the spectral data, we can sum the expected DBE:\n*   Aromatic ring: 1 ring + 3 π-bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given formulas using the formula: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 (for a compound with formula CxHyO2).\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. (Incorrect)\n*   **B) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. (Incorrect)\n*   **D) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n\nThis analysis eliminates options A and C. We are left with C12H14O2 and C11H12O2.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Molecular Structure and Final Verification\n\nLet's build the molecule from the fragments we've identified from the NMR data:\n1.  A di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4** (contributes 4H)\n2.  A propenyl group substituent: **-CH=CH-CH3** (contributes C3H5)\n3.  An ester substituent containing a methyl group, e.g., a methyl carboxylate group (**-COOCH3**, contributes C2H3O2) or an acetoxy group (**-OCOCH3**, contributes C2H3O2).\n\nLet's assemble these pieces and sum the atoms. For example, a possible structure is methyl 4-propenylbenzoate:\n*   **C atoms:** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from COOCH3) = **11 carbons**\n*   **H atoms:** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from COOCH3) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **O atoms:** 2 (from COOCH3) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting formula is **C11H12O2**. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data:\n*   It has the correct DBE of 6.\n*   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   It has an ester group.\n*   It contains a propenyl group giving the characteristic vinyl signals.\n*   It has two distinct methyl groups.\n*   It contains no CH2 groups.\n*   The total proton count (12H) matches the formula.\n\nNow, let's consider the other possibility, **C12H14O2**.\n*   This formula has the correct DBE of 6.\n*   However, compared to C11H12O2, it has one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (a \"CH2\" unit).\n*   To incorporate a CH2 unit into our proposed structure would create a -CH2- signal in the NMR spectrum.\n*   The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**.\n*   Furthermore, if we analyze the proton count for C12H14O2: Total H = 14. Aromatic H = 4. Vinyl H = 2. This leaves 14 - 4 - 2 = 8 protons. These 8 protons would have to be distributed among methyl groups (since CH2 is forbidden), which is impossible as 8 is not a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, the formula C12H14O2 is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the constraints from the FTIR and 1H NMR data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR:** The problem states that the FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. An ester group has the general formula R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) have two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with this information.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify Structural Fragments and Proton Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. Two signals for the aromatic protons typically suggest a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly a 1,4- (para-) disubstituted benzene ring. A para-substituted ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6**H4**), which appear as two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system, often simplified to two doublets). Thus, we have **4 aromatic protons**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** There are two signals for vinyl protons (protons on a C=C double bond). One is a doublet (d) and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (each peak of the doublet becomes a quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets (dq). This accounts for **1 vinyl proton**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This accounts for the second **1 vinyl proton**.\n    *   **–CH3 Groups (2 signals):** There are two signals for methyl groups.\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-**CH3**), which accounts for **3 protons**.\n        *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Since the problem states there are no –CH2 groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (e.g., -COO**CH3**) or an acetate ester (e.g., -O-CO-**CH3**). Both contain a methyl group, which accounts for another **3 protons**.\n    *   **No –CH2 Groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a -CH2- unit.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    Based on the NMR analysis, we can sum the number of protons in the molecule:\n    Total H = (Aromatic H) + (Vinyl H) + (Methyl H)\n    Total H = 4 + (1 + 1) + (3 + 3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n\n4.  **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**\n    The molecular formula must contain 12 hydrogen atoms. Let's look at the options:\n    A) C12H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    B) C11H14O2 (14 H) - **Eliminated**\n    C) C11H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    D) C12H14O2 (14 H) - **Eliminated**\n    We are now left with two choices: C12H12O2 and C11H12O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Carbon Atoms:**\n    Now, let's assemble the fragments we've identified and count the carbon atoms:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring (**C6**H4) contributes **6 carbons**.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The -CH=CH-CH3 group contributes **3 carbons**.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The ester group containing a methyl group, either -**C**OO**C**H3 or -O**C**O**C**H3, contributes **2 carbons**.\n\n    Total C = (Ring C) + (Propenyl C) + (Ester C)\n    Total C = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11 carbons**.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Chemical Formula:**\n    Based on our analysis, the molecule contains 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms.\n    The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n7.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE for C11H12O2 is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    The proposed structure contains:\n    *   One benzene ring (4 DBEs)\n    *   One C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 DBE)\n    *   One C=O double bond in the ester group (1 DBE)\n    Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The calculated DBE matches the structural features deduced from the spectra, confirming our conclusion.\n\nComparing our result with the remaining options, C11H12O2 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Substituent (Ester Group):**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, which has the general structure R-COO-R'.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum provides a crucial clue: \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\" This rules out common ester types like ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl esters, as they contain -CH2- groups.\n    *   The simplest ester that does not have a -CH2- group is a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n    *   The presence of a methyl ester is consistent with the 1H NMR data, which shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". One of these signals would be from the methyl ester's -CH3 group.\n    *   So, the first substituent is a methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains **2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Substituent:**\n    *   We need to account for the remaining signals in the 1H NMR spectrum. We have already accounted for one -CH3 signal. The remaining signals are:\n        *   Two signals for aromatic-H (these are on the C6H4 ring itself).\n        *   Two signals for vinyl-H (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   One more signal for a -CH3 group.\n    *   The vinyl-H signals are described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\". This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n        *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3(c) group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The signal for H(a) is split only by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   The signal for the CH3(c) group is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet. This accounts for the second -CH3 signal.\n    *   This -CH=CH-CH3 group perfectly matches the NMR description. This fragment contains **3 carbons and 5 hydrogens**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   Now, we combine all the identified parts of the molecule:\n        *   Aromatic ring: **C6H4**\n        *   First substituent (methyl ester): **C2H3O2** (from -COOCH3)\n        *   Second substituent (propenyl group): **C3H5** (from -CH=CH-CH3)\n    *   Sum the atoms from all fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 2 + 3 = 11\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 3 + 5 = 12\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound from the given spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Information**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which can be represented as a C6H4 group.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the proposed formulas. An ester group also contains a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It rules out groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6**H4**). Two signals for these 4 protons typically indicate a para-substitution pattern with two different substituents, resulting in two doublets (an AA'BB' system). This fragment accounts for **C6** and **H4**.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   Let's label the protons: `(A)H-C=C(B)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton (A) is adjacent to only proton (B), so its signal would be a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   Proton (B) is adjacent to proton (A) (1H) and the methyl group (3H). According to the n+1 rule, it will be split into a doublet by proton (A) and a quartet by the -CH3 group. This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This fragment is `-CH=CH-CH3` and accounts for **C3** and **H5** (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl proton.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since there are no -CH2- groups, this methyl group is likely part of the ester, forming a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this fragment adds a **-CH3** group, accounting for **H3**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula**\n\nLet's sum up the atoms from the fragments we have deduced:\n\n*   **From the aromatic ring:** C6H4\n*   **From the vinyl and first methyl groups:** A propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This has C3H5.\n*   **From the ester and the second methyl group:** We need an ester (`-COO-`) and a methyl group (`-CH3`). The most logical combinations that don't introduce a CH2 group are a methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n    *   If the substituent is `-COOCH3`, it contributes C2H3O2.\n    *   If the substituent is `-O-CO-CH3`, it contributes C2H3O2.\n\nLet's build a complete molecule. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring must be the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n\n*   **Structure 1:** `(propenyl group)`-C6H4-`(methyl carboxylate group)` -> `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3`\n*   **Structure 2:** `(propenyl group)`-C6H4-`(acetoxy group)` -> `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3`\n\nNow, let's calculate the total molecular formula for either of these possible structures:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester/acetate part) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester/acetate part) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated formula is C11H12O2. Let's compare this with the given choices:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nOur derived formula matches option C.\n\nTo be certain, we can quickly re-check the hydrogen and carbon counts from the NMR data alone:\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (methyl 1) + 3 (methyl 2) = 12 H. This eliminates options A (14 H) and D (14 H).\n*   **Total Carbons:** 6 (aromatic ring) + 2 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (methyl C) + 1 (second methyl C) + 1 (ester C=O) = 11 C. This eliminates option B (12 C).\n\nBoth methods of analysis consistently lead to the same formula.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains one carbonyl (C=O) and one C-O bond. It has a molecular formula fragment of -CO2-.\n*   **General Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring with two other groups attached to it. The core of this ring is C6H4.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests a substitution pattern like ortho (1,2-disubstituted) or para (1,4-disubstituted). In either case, we have a C6H4 group.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic and very informative splitting pattern. It strongly suggests the presence of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by the adjacent H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (giving a quartet). The combination results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is split only by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment, which has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl signals belongs to the `-CH=CH-CH3` group we just identified. Therefore, there must be a second, distinct `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we have the following pieces of the molecule:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n*   An ester group: `-COO-`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n*   A methyl group: `-CH3`\n\nNow, we must assemble these fragments into a valid chemical structure that is consistent with all the data. The ester group must link two parts of the molecule. There are two primary ways the benzene ring can be part of an ester:\n\n*   **Case A: Methyl Benzoate derivative:** The ring is attached to the carbonyl part of the ester (`C6H4-COO-R`). The two substituents on the ring would be the propenyl group and the ester group itself. R would be the remaining fragment, which is a methyl group (`-CH3`). However, the NMR specifies *two* -CH3 signals, one from the propenyl group and one other. This would only provide one -CH3 signal from the propenyl group and one from the ester's methyl group, which seems to fit. Let's reconsider. The question says there are two signals corresponding to `-CH3` groups. Our fragments are C6H4, COO, -CH=CH-CH3, and -CH3. It seems more likely the two substituents on the ring are -CH3 and something else.\n\nLet's try a different assembly. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are a methyl group (`-CH3`) and the ester group.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 1: Propenyl methylbenzoate**\n    *   Let's place the `-CH3` group and the ester group onto the benzene ring. This gives a `CH3-C6H4-COO-` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragment is the propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This group must be attached to the oxygen of the ester.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH3-C6H4-COO-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   This structure fits all the NMR data: two aromatic signals (possible for ortho/para), vinyl signals for `-O-CH=CH-CH3`, two distinct -CH3 signals (one on the ring, one on the vinyl group), and no -CH2 groups.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 2: Methyl propenylbenzoate**\n    *   Let's place the `-CH=CH-CH3` group and the ester group onto the ring. This gives a `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-COO-` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragment is the methyl group, `-CH3`. This must be attached to the ester oxygen.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-COOCH3`.\n    *   This structure also fits all the NMR data: two aromatic signals, vinyl signals for `Ar-CH=CH-CH3`, two distinct -CH3 signals (one on the vinyl group, one from the methyl ester), and no -CH2 groups.\n\n**3. Calculate the Chemical Formula**\n\nBoth plausible structures are isomers and should have the same chemical formula. Let's calculate it for the first structure (`CH3-C6H4-COO-CH=CH-CH3`):\n*   **Carbons (C):** 1 (from methyl on ring) + 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 3 (from propenyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 3 (from methyl on ring) + 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** This would require adding a carbon atom without changing the hydrogen count, which is not possible with simple organic groups. It would disrupt the structure that fits the NMR data.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** To get this formula from C11H12O2, one must add a `CH2` group. The problem statement explicitly says there are no signals for `-CH2` groups. This option is incorrect.\n*   **D) C11H14O2:** This formula has two more hydrogens than our derived structure. To add two hydrogens, we would need to remove a double bond. However, the NMR data clearly shows a `C=C` double bond (vinyl protons). This option contradicts the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly aligns with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core formula for this part is C6H4.\n    *   The aromatic nature implies 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An \"ester group\" is present. An ester has the structure R-COO-R', which contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This accounts for one more degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many possibilities. For example, we cannot have ethyl, propyl, or butyl groups in their standard forms.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4-disubstitution (para). This confirms the C6H4 part. Total protons so far: 4.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring. Let's analyze the coupling:\n        *   Structure: `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is adjacent to `H(b)`, so its signal is split into a **doublet**.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is adjacent to `H(a)` (causing a doublet split) and also to the three protons of the methyl group (causing a quartet split). The resulting signal is a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, -C3H5. This group adds 1 degree of unsaturation (the C=C double bond). Total protons from this group: 1+1+3 = 5.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** The NMR spectrum shows two distinct methyl group signals.\n        *   One methyl signal belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified.\n        *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-O-CO-CH3).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's assemble the identified parts to build the whole molecule.\n    *   **Fragment 1:** The di-substituted aromatic ring: **C6H4**.\n    *   **Fragment 2:** The propenyl group: **-C3H5**.\n    *   **Fragment 3:** The ester group part containing the second methyl group.\n        *   If it's a methyl ester group attached to the ring: -COOCH3. The formula for this fragment is **-C2H3O2**.\n        *   If it's an acetate group attached to the ring: -O-CO-CH3. The formula for this fragment is also **-C2H3O2**.\n    *   Both possibilities for the ester group fragment have the same formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify the Formula:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Let's check if our proposed structure has 6 DoU: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (propenyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = 6. The DoU matches.\n    *   The formula C11H12O2 corresponds to option C. Other options like C12H14O2 or C11H14O2 would imply the presence of CH2 groups or a different degree of unsaturation, which contradicts the given data. C12H12O2 was shown in the thought process to be inconsistent with the number of vinyl signals.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **FTIR:** The presence of an ester group is confirmed. An ester functional group contains the structure R-COO-R' and has two oxygen atoms. This means the molecular formula must end in O2. All four options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) satisfy this condition.\n\n    *   **Molecular Structure Core:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This implies a benzene ring with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula of this part of the molecule is C6H4.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means we can eliminate any proposed structure that contains a methylene (-CH2-) group. This rules out substituents like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or allyl (-CH2CH=CH2).\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** The compound has two distinct types of methyl groups.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically `–CH=CH–CH3`.\n            *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n            *   This group contributes `C3H5` to the formula and accounts for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n        *   **Putting it together:** Since one –CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group, the second –CH3 signal must belong to the ester. Given the \"no –CH2\" rule, the ester must be a methyl ester (`–COOCH3`), not an ethyl or larger ester. This group contributes `CO2CH3` to the formula.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) with two different substituents in a para (1,4) arrangement would give two signals (two doublets), consistent with this description.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Deduced Structure:**\n\n    We have the following components:\n    *   A benzene ring core: `C6H4`\n    *   A propenyl group substituent: `–C3H5`\n    *   A methyl ester substituent: `–COOCH3`\n\n    Combining these parts gives the molecule methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\n    Let's sum the atoms from the assembled structure:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 1 (from –CO–) + 1 (from –OCH3) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from –OCH3) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\n    The DBE (or index of hydrogen deficiency) can be used as a check.\n    *   **From spectral data:** Aromatic ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds) = 4 DBE. Ester C=O group = 1 DBE. Vinyl C=C group = 1 DBE. Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   **From the derived formula (C11H12O2):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    The DBE calculation is consistent.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (DBE = 12 + 1 - 14/2 = 6)\n    *   B) C11H12O2 (DBE = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6)\n    *   C) C12H12O2 (DBE = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7)\n    *   D) C11H14O2 (DBE = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5)\n\n    *   Option D is incorrect because its DBE of 5 is too low to accommodate an aromatic ring, an ester, and a vinyl group.\n    *   Option C is incorrect because its DBE of 7 implies an extra ring or double bond for which there is no evidence in the NMR data.\n    *   This leaves options A and B. To get from B (C11H12O2) to A (C12H14O2), one must add a `CH2` unit. As established from the NMR data, the molecule contains no `–CH2–` groups. Therefore, option A is impossible.\n\n    The only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence is **C11H12O2**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct chemical formula for a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectral data. Let's break down the information provided step-by-step to deduce the structure and its formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectral data:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents, which means the core has the formula -C6H4-. A benzene ring contributes 4 units to the degree of unsaturation (DoU) (one for the ring itself and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group. An ester functional group contains a carbonyl (C=O) and a C-O single bond. The carbonyl group contributes 1 unit to the DoU. So far, the required DoU is 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) = 5.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum - Six Signals:**\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** In a di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4), there are 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals implies symmetry. This pattern is characteristic of a para (1,4)-substituted benzene ring, where the two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are equivalent, giving rise to two signals (often two doublets).\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** These are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This C=C bond adds another unit to the DoU, bringing the total to 6.\n            *   Signal 1: A doublet. This indicates the proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n            *   Signal 2: A doublet of quartets. This indicates the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group, giving the quartet).\n            *   This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring). Let's call the ring `Ar`. In the structure `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`, H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet. H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and this doublet is further split by the -CH3 group into quartets, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment accounts for one C=C double bond, two vinyl protons, and one -CH3 group. The formula of this fragment is **-C3H5**.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group described above. The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester functionality.\n        *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that restricts the possible structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure and determine the formula:**\n    *   We have the para-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**.\n    *   We have the propenyl substituent: **-C3H5**.\n    *   We have an ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3). The absence of -CH2- signals means the methyl group must be directly attached to the carbonyl (acetate ester, Ar-O-CO-CH3) or the ester oxygen (methyl ester, Ar-COOCH3). Both possibilities lead to the same fragment count. Let's assume a methyl ester substituent: **-COOCH3**. This fragment has the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result against the given options:**\n    *   The derived formula C11H12O2 matches option A.\n    *   Let's check the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2. DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6. This matches our structural analysis: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (C=C in propenyl) + 1 (C=O in ester) = 6.\n    *   Now, let's briefly consider the other options:\n        *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 5. This would mean no C=C double bond in the side chain, which contradicts the vinyl-H signals.\n        *   C) C12H12O2: DoU = 7. This requires an additional double bond or ring, for which there is no evidence.\n        *   D) C12H14O2: DoU = 6. This formula has the same DoU as option A, but differs by a CH2 unit. Since the NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, this option is ruled out.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe user wants me to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on several pieces of spectroscopic data. I will break down each piece of information to determine the constituent atoms.\n\n1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**:\n    *   A benzene ring has the formula C6H6.\n    *   If it is di-substituted, two hydrogen atoms are replaced by other groups.\n    *   This leaves a **C6H4** fragment.\n    *   Running tally: C=6, H=4\n\n2.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of an ester group\"**:\n    *   An ester group has the functional formula -COO-.\n    *   This adds **2 Oxygen atoms** and **1 Carbon atom** (from the C=O carbonyl).\n    *   Running tally: C=6+1=7, H=4, O=2\n\n3.  **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**: This provides information about the hydrogen atoms and their neighboring groups.\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This confirms the C6H4 fragment. The four hydrogens are in two different chemical environments (which is consistent with ortho or para substitution), giving rise to two distinct signals. We have already accounted for these 4 hydrogens.\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl-H are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   A signal that is a \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) is highly characteristic of a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to both another proton on the double bond and a methyl group. This points strongly to a propenyl group fragment: **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's verify the splitting: The H atom on the carbon next to the CH3 group (`=CH-CH3`) is split by the other vinyl H (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3 group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl H (`-CH=`) is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet. This perfectly matches the description.\n        *   This fragment (-CH=CH-CH3) contains **3 Carbon atoms** and **5 Hydrogen atoms** (1+1+3=5).\n        *   Running tally: C=7+3=10, H=4+5=9, O=2\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**:\n        *   We have already identified one CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment. The data states there are *two* signals for CH3 groups, so there must be another one.\n        *   This second methyl group (**-CH3**) must be attached somewhere else in the molecule, likely as part of the ester (e.g., -COOCH3) or attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   This fragment adds **1 Carbon atom** and **3 Hydrogen atoms**.\n        *   Running tally: C=10+1=11, H=9+3=12, O=2\n\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a useful piece of negative information, confirming we are not missing any methylene (-CH2-) units.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from aromatic ring) + 1 (from ester carbonyl) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from second methyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from aromatic ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from second methyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe deduced chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis matches option C from the choices provided.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the provided spectroscopic data to identify functional groups and structural fragments.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for this core is C6H4. The presence of a ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DOU).\n    *   **FTIR: \"ester group\"**: This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O bond in the ester adds 1 DOU.\n    *   **1H NMR signals**:\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests an ortho or meta substitution pattern with different substituents, or a para substitution. This is consistent with the C6H4 core.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a group with no protons on the adjacent atom (like the aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's label the group: Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   The signal for H(a) is split only by H(b), so it appears as a doublet.\n            *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) (giving a doublet) and by the three protons of the -CH3 group (giving a quartet). The resulting signal is a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, -C3H5. This group also contains a C=C double bond, which adds 1 DOU.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: One -CH3 group is accounted for by the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3). The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or have any other alkyl chain longer than a methyl group. Combined with the presence of a second -CH3 signal, this strongly points to the ester being either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3). In both cases, this fragment has the formula C2H3O2.\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula.**\n    *   Aromatic core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): -CH=CH-CH3, which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester part): -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3, both having the formula C2H3O2.\n    *   Now, we sum the atoms from these parts to find the total molecular formula:\n        *   Carbon atoms: 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (from ester) = 2 oxygens.\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify the result by checking the Degrees of Unsaturation (DOU).**\n    *   The structural features identified are: 1 benzene ring (4 DOU), 1 C=C double bond (1 DOU), and 1 C=O double bond (1 DOU).\n    *   Total expected DOU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's calculate the DOU from the derived formula, C11H12O2, using the formula DOU = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   DOU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The calculated DOU matches the expected DOU from the structure, confirming our assignment.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare the derived formula with the given options.**\n    *   A) C12H12O2 (DOU = 7)\n    *   B) C11H14O2 (DOU = 5)\n    *   C) C11H12O2 (DOU = 6)\n    *   D) C12H14O2 (DOU = 6)\n    *   Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. The other options are inconsistent. For instance, C12H14O2 has the correct DOU, but building a molecule with that formula that also matches the NMR data (no CH2, only two CH3 signals) is not possible. Adding a CH3 to C11H12O2 would necessitate removing an H, creating C12H14O2, but would result in three CH3 signals, which contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula options.\n    *   **Structure Core:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. The base formula for the ring itself, after substitution, is C6H4, assuming the two substituents replace two hydrogen atoms. The 1H NMR data, showing two signals for aromatic hydrogens, strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern, which would have this C6H4 core.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR signals:** The spectrum shows six signals in total. Let's identify the groups responsible for these signals.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This corresponds to the 4 protons on the di-substituted benzene ring (C6**H4**). A 1,4-disubstituted ring would give two signals for two protons each (typically two doublets), which fits this description.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a C=C double bond outside the aromatic ring.\n        *   Signal 1: A doublet.\n        *   Signal 2: A doublet of quartets.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton (giving a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals belongs to the methyl group of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) group we just identified. This methyl group's signal would be a doublet due to splitting by the adjacent vinyl proton.\n        *   The second –CH3 signal must belong to another part of the molecule. Since we know there's an ester, this is likely a methyl group attached to the ester, either as a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, it's a **CH3** group. This signal would appear as a singlet as it has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl (other than propenyl), or other methylene-containing chains in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular structure and determine the formula:**\n    Let's assemble the pieces we have identified:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**\n    *   A propenyl substituent: **C3H5**\n    *   An ester group containing a methyl group. Let's analyze the two possibilities for the ester substituent:\n        *   Possibility A: A methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n        *   Possibility B: An acetoxy group, `-OCOCH3`. This also has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms from the core (C6H4) and the two substituents (the C3H5 group and the C2H3O2 group) to find the total molecular formula.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl of ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU formula is `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`.\n    For C11H12O2, DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    Let's check the DoU from the proposed structure:\n    *   1 for the benzene ring.\n    *   3 for the double bonds within the benzene ring.\n    *   1 for the vinyl C=C double bond.\n    *   1 for the ester C=O double bond.\n    *   Total DoU = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The DoU matches, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D. The other options are incorrect:\n    *   C12H14O2 and C12H12O2 have the wrong carbon count.\n    *   C11H14O2 has too many hydrogens, which would mean a lower degree of unsaturation (DoU = 5), contradicting the presence of the aromatic ring, a vinyl group, and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Furthermore, any option with more than 12 hydrogens or containing a -CH2- unit would contradict the NMR data. For example, C11H14O2 would likely arise from reducing the C=C bond of the propenyl group to a C-C bond (propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3), but this would eliminate the vinyl signals and introduce two CH2 signals.\n\nTherefore, the only possible formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically piecing together the information from the provided spectra.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Determine the Number of Hydrogens and Structural Fragments:**\n\n*   **Aromatic-H signals (2 signals):** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring) has 4 protons on the ring itself (formula C6H4). The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents, which would give a characteristic AA'BB' system, often appearing as two distinct signals (doublets).\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **4 H** (aromatic)\n\n*   **Vinyl-H signals (2 signals, one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   Let's label the carbons: Ring-CH(A)=CH(B)-CH3(C).\n    *   H(B) is split by H(A) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   H(A) is only split by H(B), resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons.\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **2 H** (vinyl)\n\n*   **–CH3 group signals (2 signals):**\n    *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group is adjacent to a vinyl proton (H(B)), so its signal would be a doublet.\n    *   The other -CH3 signal must belong to the second substituent, the ester group. Since there are no adjacent protons, this would be a singlet.\n    *   These two methyl groups account for 2 * 3 = 6 protons.\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **6 H** (methyl)\n\n*   **No –CH2 group signals:** This is a key constraint that eliminates many possibilities.\n\n**2. Sum the Hydrogens:**\n\nBy adding up the protons from all the identified fragments, we can determine the total number of hydrogens in the molecule.\nTotal H = 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = **12 H**\n\nNow, we can compare this with the options provided:\nA) C11H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\nB) C12H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\nC) C11H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**.\nD) C12H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**.\n\nThis analysis narrows the choice down to C or D.\n\n**3. Determine the Carbon Count:**\n\nLet's build the molecule's carbon skeleton based on the fragments we identified.\n*   **Di-substituted benzene ring:** This is a C6H4 fragment, so **6 Carbons**.\n*   **Propenyl group:** The -CH=CH-CH3 group has **3 Carbons**.\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-), which contains one C=O bond. The second methyl group must be part of this ester. There are two possibilities that fit the \"no -CH2\" rule:\n    1.  A methyl ester: -COOCH3. This contains **2 Carbons** (the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon).\n    2.  An acetate group attached via oxygen: -O-CO-CH3. This also contains **2 Carbons**.\nIn either case, this fragment contributes 2 carbons.\n\n**4. Sum the Carbons:**\n\nTotal C = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester fragment) = **11 C**\n\n**5. Final Identification:**\n\nThe molecule must have 11 carbons and 12 hydrogens. The only formula that matches this is **C11H12O2**. The two oxygens are from the ester group.\n\nTo confirm, let's check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\nOur proposed structure has:\n*   1 benzene ring = 4 DoU\n*   1 C=C double bond (in propenyl) = 1 DoU\n*   1 C=O double bond (in ester) = 1 DoU\n*   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated DoU matches the DoU derived from the structure, confirming our analysis. The chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a C6H4 benzene core with two substituents.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum (6 signals total):**\n        *   **2 signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals is characteristic of certain substitution patterns, like para-substitution (which would give an AA'BB' system, often appearing as two distinct signals/doublets). Total H count from this part is 4.\n        *   **2 signals for vinyl-H (C=CH):** One signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern is highly indicative of a propenyl group, specifically the `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment.\n            *   Let's label the protons: `Ring-C(Ha)=C(Hb)-CH3`.\n            *   Proton `Ha` is adjacent to one proton (`Hb`), so it would appear as a **doublet**. This matches the data.\n            *   Proton `Hb` is adjacent to one proton (`Ha`) and three equivalent protons of the methyl group. This coupling would split the signal into a **doublet of quartets**. This perfectly matches the data.\n            *   Therefore, one of the substituents contains a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. This fragment has 2 vinyl protons.\n        *   **2 signals for -CH3 groups:**\n            *   One of these methyl groups is the one from the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This methyl group is adjacent to the `Hb` vinyl proton, so it would appear as a doublet.\n            *   The second methyl group must be located elsewhere in the molecule. Given the presence of an ester and the constraint of \"no -CH2- groups\", the most likely position for this methyl is as the alkyl part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or the acetyl part of a phenyl acetate-type ester (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this methyl group would be a singlet as it has no adjacent protons.\n            *   This confirms the presence of two distinct methyl groups.\n        *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a key constraint that confirms our proposed fragments, as neither a propenyl group, a methyl ester group, nor a phenyl acetate-type group contain any `-CH2-` (methylene) units.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure from the fragments:**\n    *   **Core:** C6H4 (di-substituted benzene ring).\n    *   **Substituent 1:** `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl group).\n    *   **Substituent 2:** An ester group containing a methyl group, e.g., `-COOCH3` (methyl ester group).\n    *   Let's check if this structure (a propenyl methylbenzoate) fits all the data.\n        *   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   It contains an ester.\n        *   The NMR signals match perfectly (2 aromatic, 2 vinyl, 2 methyl).\n        *   It has no -CH2- groups.\n        *   The total number of 1H NMR signals would be 2 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 6 signals. This matches the given information.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of protons:**\n    *   From the ring (C6H4): 4 H\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 H\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 3 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 H.\n    *   This immediately eliminates options with H14 (A and D). We are left with B (C12H12O2) and C (C11H12O2).\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of Carbon and Oxygen atoms:**\n    *   From the ring (C6H4): 6 C\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 C\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 1 C (from C=O) + 1 C (from O-CH3) = 2 C\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2 O\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 C.\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2 O.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Chemical Formula:**\n    *   Based on the atom count, the chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify with other possibilities and Degree of Unsaturation (DBU):**\n    *   The alternative ester structure, propenyl phenyl acetate (`CH3CO-O-C6H4-CH=CHCH3`), also gives the formula C11H12O2. So regardless of the exact isomer, the formula is the same.\n    *   The DBU for C11H12O2 is `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6`. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 DBUs), one C=C double bond (1 DBU), and one C=O double bond (1 DBU).\n    *   The formula C12H12O2 would have a DBU of 7. It is not possible to add another DBU (e.g., another ring or double bond) and an extra Carbon to our structure without violating the strict NMR rules provided.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
