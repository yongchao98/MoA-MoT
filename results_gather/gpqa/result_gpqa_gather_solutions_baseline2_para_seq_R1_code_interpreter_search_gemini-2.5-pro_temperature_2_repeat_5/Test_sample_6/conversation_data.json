This makes the universe opaque to such high-energy photons over long distances.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe process to solve this problem involves using the principles of special relativity and particle physics.\n\n1.  **Identify the physical process:** The reaction is photon-photon annihilation producing an electron-positron pair:  $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the threshold condition:** For any particle production reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the sum of the rest mass energies of the particles being created. In this case, we are creating an electron ($e^{-}$) and a positron ($e^{+}$), which have identical rest masses ($m_e$).\n    The minimum required energy in the CM frame is:\n    $\\sqrt{s}_{min} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$\n    where 's' is the Mandelstam variable, representing the square of the center-of-mass energy.\n\n3.  **Use Lorentz Invariance:** The quantity 's' is a Lorentz invariant, which means it has the same value in all inertial reference frames. We can calculate its value in the laboratory frame, where we observe a high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) colliding with a stationary CMB photon ($\\epsilon_{CMB}$).\n    The four-momentum of the high-energy photon is $p_1 = (E_\\gamma/c, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ and for the CMB photon is $p_2 = (\\epsilon_{CMB}/c, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$.\n    The invariant mass squared 's' is given by $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2$. This expands to:\n    $s = 2 E_\\gamma \\epsilon_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between the propagation directions of the two photons.\n\n4.  **Find the minimum gamma-ray energy:** We want to find the lowest possible energy $E_\\gamma$ for which the reaction can occur. This happens when the interaction is most efficient, which corresponds to a head-on collision. For a head-on collision, the angle $\\theta = 180^\\circ$ (or $\\pi$ radians), and $\\cos(180^\\circ) = -1$.\n    In this case, the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized: $(1 - (-1)) = 2$.\n\n5.  **Set up the final equation:** Equating the threshold condition from the CM frame with the calculation in the lab frame:\n    $s_{min} = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n    $s_{lab} = 2 E_\\gamma \\epsilon_{CMB} (2) = 4 E_\\gamma \\epsilon_{CMB}$\n    Setting them equal:\n    $4 E_\\gamma \\epsilon_{CMB} = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4 (m_e c^2)^2$\n    Simplifying gives:\n    $E_\\gamma \\epsilon_{CMB} = (m_e c^2)^2$\n    Solving for the threshold energy of the gamma-ray, $E_\\gamma$:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the value:** We are given:\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    The python code calculated this as:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n7.  **Convert to GeV:** Since the answers are in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$):\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, corresponds to option C. This is the energy threshold above which high-energy gamma-rays have their mean free path in the universe drastically shortened due to interactions with the CMB, effectively limiting their \"lifetime\" or observable distance.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe problem asks for the energy threshold of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can interact with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{-}e^{+}$). This process is known as pair production. The reaction is:\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+} $$\n\nTo solve this, we will use the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum and the concept of Lorentz invariance.\n\n1.  **Four-Momentum Conservation:**\n    Let the four-momenta of the initial particles be $P_{\\gamma}$ for the high-energy photon and $P_{CMB}$ for the CMB photon. Let the four-momenta of the final particles be $P_{e^{-}}$ for the electron and $P_{e^{+}}$ for the positron. The conservation of four-momentum states:\n    $$ P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB} = P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}} $$\n\n2.  **Invariant Mass:**\n    The square of the total four-momentum, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames.\n    $$ s = (P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = (P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2 $$\n\n3.  **Center-of-Mass Frame at Threshold:**\n    The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. This occurs when the final particles (electron and positron) are created with zero kinetic energy in their center-of-mass (CM) frame. In this frame, they are produced at rest.\n    The total energy in the CM frame at threshold is the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron:\n    $$ E_{CM} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2 $$\n    Since the particles are at rest in this frame, their total momentum is zero. The square of the total four-momentum of the final state is:\n    $$ (P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2 = \\left(\\frac{E_{CM}}{c}\\right)^2 = (2m_e c)^2 = 4m_e^2 c^2 $$\n\n4.  **Laboratory Frame:**\n    Now, let's evaluate the square of the initial four-momentum in the laboratory frame (our frame of reference).\n    $$ (P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} $$\n    For photons, the rest mass is zero, so their four-momentum squared is zero ($P^2 = (mc)^2 = 0$). Thus, $P_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $P_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $$ (P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} $$\n    The dot product of the four-momenta is $P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}c^2$ (using units where c=1 is common, but we will keep c for clarity: $P_{\\mu} = (E/c, \\vec{p})$, so $P_1 \\cdot P_2 = E_1E_2/c^2 - \\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2$).\n    Since $E=|\\vec{p}|c$ for photons, this becomes:\n    $$ P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = \\frac{E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2} - \\frac{E_{\\gamma}}{c}\\frac{E_{CMB}}{c}\\cos\\theta = \\frac{E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two incoming photons.\n    So, in the lab frame, $s = \\frac{2 E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n5.  **Solving for the Threshold Energy:**\n    Equating the expressions for $s$ from the CM frame and the lab frame:\n    $$ 4m_e^2 c^2 = \\frac{2 E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\n    Solving for the gamma-ray energy $E_{\\gamma}$:\n    $$ E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{4m_e^2 c^4}{2E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)} $$\n    To find the *minimum* or *threshold* energy ($E_{\\gamma, th}$) for the high-energy photon, we need to consider the most efficient collision scenario. This corresponds to maximizing the denominator, which occurs when $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximum. The maximum value is 2, which happens when $\\theta = \\pi$ (a head-on collision).\n    $$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(1 - (-1))} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{2E_{CMB}} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}} $$\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron is a known constant, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\n    Plugging these values into the threshold energy formula:\n    $$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n    The question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nThis result, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, is known as the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit for photons. Gamma-rays with energies above this threshold have very short mean free paths in the universe because they are highly likely to interact with CMB photons and produce electron-positron pairs, effectively limiting their lifetime and the distance they can travel.\n\nComparing our calculated value to the given options:\nA) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nC) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nOur calculated value of $2.611 \\times 10^5$ GeV matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) to interact with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) and produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). The reaction is:\n\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$\n\nThis process is a classic example of pair production from photon-photon annihilation. We can solve this by considering the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum.\n\nLet the four-momenta of the particles be:\n*   High-energy gamma-ray: $P_{\\gamma} = (E_{\\gamma}, \\vec{p}_{\\gamma})$\n*   CMB photon: $P_{\\epsilon} = (\\epsilon, \\vec{p}_{\\epsilon})$\n*   Electron: $P_{e^-}$\n*   Positron: $P_{e^+}$\n\nHere, $E_{\\gamma}$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, and $\\epsilon$ is the energy of the CMB photon. The rest mass of both the electron and the positron is $m_e$. We will use natural units where the speed of light $c=1$.\n\nThe conservation of four-momentum states:\n$P_{\\gamma} + P_{\\epsilon} = P_{e^-} + P_{e^+}$\n\nA useful technique is to square the total four-momentum, as this quantity (the Mandelstam variable $s$) is Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames of reference.\n\n$s = (P_{\\gamma} + P_{\\epsilon})^2 = (P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2$\n\nLet's evaluate the left side in the lab frame (where we observe the collision). For photons, the square of their four-momentum is zero ($P^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = 0$).\n$(P_{\\gamma} + P_{\\epsilon})^2 = P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{\\epsilon}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{\\epsilon} = 0 + 0 + 2 (E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{\\epsilon})$\nSince $|\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}| = E_{\\gamma}$ and $|\\vec{p}_{\\epsilon}| = \\epsilon$, the dot product is $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{\\epsilon} = E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\nSo, $s = 2E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the right side at the threshold energy. The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. In the center-of-mass (CM) frame, this corresponds to the electron and positron being created at rest.\nIn the CM frame at threshold:\n*   Electron momentum: $\\vec{p}_{e^-} = 0$, Energy: $E_{e^-} = m_e$\n*   Positron momentum: $\\vec{p}_{e^+} = 0$, Energy: $E_{e^+} = m_e$\nThe total four-momentum of the final state in the CM frame is $P_{final, CM} = (m_e + m_e, \\vec{0}) = (2m_e, \\vec{0})$.\nThe square of this is $(P_{final, CM})^2 = (2m_e)^2 = 4m_e^2$.\n\nSince $s$ is Lorentz invariant, we can equate the expressions from the lab frame and the CM frame:\n$2E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4m_e^2$\n\nWe are looking for the threshold energy $E_{\\gamma, th}$. To initiate the reaction, the incoming gamma-ray must have at least this energy. The energy required is lowest when the interaction is most efficient. From the equation, $E_{\\gamma}$ is minimized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This occurs for a head-on collision, where the photons travel towards each other, so $\\theta = \\pi$ and $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\nIn this case, $(1 - \\cos\\pi) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nThe equation for the minimum threshold energy becomes:\n$2E_{\\gamma, th}\\epsilon(2) = 4m_e^2$\n$4E_{\\gamma, th}\\epsilon = 4m_e^2$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{m_e^2}{\\epsilon}$\n\nNow, we plug in the given and known values:\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Rest mass of an electron, $m_e = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, represents the energy threshold above which high-energy gamma-rays have their mean free path (and thus their \"lifetime\" in the universe) significantly limited by pair production with CMB photons.

The most straightforward method is to use the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, the square of the total four-momentum of the system. This quantity is the same in all inertial reference frames.\n\n2.  **Analysis in the Center-of-Momentum (CM) Frame**:\n    At the threshold for the reaction, the final particles (electron $e^{-}$ and positron $e^{+}$) are created with the minimum possible kinetic energy, which is zero in the CM frame. They are essentially created at rest.\n    *   The rest energy of an electron is $m_e c^2$.\n    *   The rest energy of a positron is also $m_e c^2$.\n    *   The total energy in the CM frame at the threshold is the sum of the rest energies of the produced particles: $E_{CM, \\text{threshold}} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n    *   The square of the total four-momentum, $s$, in the CM frame at the threshold is $s_{\\text{threshold}} = (E_{CM, \\text{threshold}})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n3.  **Analysis in the Laboratory (Lab) Frame**:\n    In the lab frame, we have a high-energy gamma-ray with energy $E_\\gamma$ colliding with a CMB photon of energy $E_{CMB}$.\n    *   The four-momentum of the high-energy photon is $p_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$.\n    *   The four-momentum of the CMB photon is $p_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$.\n    *   The invariant $s$ is calculated as $s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$.\n    *   Since photons are massless, their four-momentum squared is zero ($p^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 c^2 = 0$). So, $p_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    *   This simplifies the expression to $s = 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$.\n    *   The dot product of the four-momenta is $p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For photons, $|\\vec{p}| = E$. Thus, $\\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_\\gamma| |\\vec{p}_{CMB}| \\cos\\theta = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n    *   Substituting this back, we get $s = 2(E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\cos\\theta) = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Finding the Threshold Energy**:\n    The threshold energy $E_\\gamma$ is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. For a given $E_\\gamma$, the maximum energy is made available for particle creation when the collision is head-on ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians), which makes $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\n    *   At this angle, $s$ is maximized for a given $E_\\gamma$: $s = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - (-1)) = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$.\n\n5.  **Equating and Solving**:\n    Now, we equate the expressions for the threshold $s$ from both the CM and Lab frames:\n    $4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n    Solving for the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    We use the known physical constants and the given value for the CMB photon energy.\n    *   Rest energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    The question asks for the answer in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion**:\n    The calculated threshold energy is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.

This process is known as pair production. The reaction is:\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+} $$\nWe need to find the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) for this reaction to occur.\n\n### 1. Kinematic Threshold Condition\nFor any reaction, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least the total rest mass energy of the products. The products here are an electron and a positron. The rest mass of an electron is $m_e$, and so is the rest mass of a positron. The rest mass energy of each is $m_e c^2$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum required energy in the CM frame, denoted as $\\sqrt{s}_{min}$, is:\n$$ \\sqrt{s}_{min} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2 $$\nThe threshold condition for the reaction is that the square of the center-of-mass energy, $s$, must be greater than or equal to the square of the minimum required energy:\n$$ s \\ge (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\n\n### 2. Lorentz Invariant Quantity\nThe quantity $s$ is a Lorentz invariant, meaning its value is the same in any inertial frame of reference. We can calculate it in the lab frame using the four-momenta of the initial particles (the two photons).\n\nLet $p_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ be the four-momentum of the high-energy photon and $p_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$ be the four-momentum of the CMB photon. The invariant mass squared $s$ is:\n$$ s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} $$\nFor photons, which are massless, the square of the four-momentum is zero ($p^2 = 0$). The equation simplifies to:\n$$ s = 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} $$\nThe dot product of the two four-momenta is $p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. Since for a photon $| \\vec{p} | c = E$, we can write this as:\n$$ s = 2(E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\cos\\theta) = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the propagation directions of the two photons.\n\n### 3. Determining the Threshold Energy\nCombining the threshold condition with the expression for $s$:\n$$ 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\ge (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\nWe are looking for the minimum energy $E_\\gamma$ for this reaction to be possible. This minimum threshold is reached under the most favorable condition for the reaction, which is when the left side of the equation is maximized for a given $E_\\gamma$. This occurs for a head-on collision, where the photons travel in opposite directions. In this case, the angle $\\theta = 180^\\circ$ (or $\\pi$ radians), and $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\nThis maximizes the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ to its highest possible value of $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this value into the inequality:\n$$ 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (2) \\ge (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\n$$ 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\ge 4 (m_e c^2)^2 $$\n$$ E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\ge (m_e c^2)^2 $$\nThe threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_{\\gamma,th}$, is therefore given by:\n$$ E_{\\gamma,th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}} $$\n\n### 4. Calculation\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$, is a known physical constant, approximately $0.511 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nLet's convert all units to electron-volts (eV):\n*   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n*   $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the threshold energy:\n$$ E_{\\gamma,th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV). We know that $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n$$ E_{\\gamma,th} = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nThis result, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, corresponds to option C.\n\nThe Python code executed in the background confirms this calculation:\n```\n# Electron rest mass energy in MeV\nm_e_c2_in_MeV = 0.511\n# Average energy of a CMB photon in eV\nE_CMB_in_eV = 1e-3\n# Convert the electron rest mass energy to eV\nm_e_c2_in_eV = m_e_c2_in_MeV * 1e6\n# Calculate the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray\nE_gamma_th_in_eV = (m_e_c2_in_eV**2) / E_CMB_in_eV\n# Convert the threshold energy from eV to GeV\nE_gamma_th_in_GeV = E_gamma_th_in_eV / 1e9\n# print(f\"{E_gamma_th_in_GeV:.2e}\")\n# Output: 2.61e+05\n```\nThe output `2.61e+05` means $2.61 \\times 10^5$, which matches our derived value.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe physical process in question is pair production, where two photons annihilate to create an electron-positron pair:\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the products. The rest mass of an electron ($m_e$) and a positron ($m_p$) are identical, and their rest energy is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe minimum required energy in the CM frame is:\n$E_{CM, min} = m_e c^2 + m_p c^2 = 2m_e c^2$\n\nThe square of the four-momentum is an invariant quantity. Let the high-energy gamma-ray have four-momentum $P_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ and the CMB photon have four-momentum $P_{CMB} = (\\epsilon, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$. The square of the total four-momentum is:\n$s = (P_\\gamma + P_{CMB})^2 = P_\\gamma^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB}$\n\nSince photons are massless, $P_\\gamma^2 = P_{CMB}^2 = 0$. The dot product is $P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_\\gamma \\epsilon - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For photons, $|\\vec{p}| = E/c$. So, $\\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_\\gamma| |\\vec{p}_{CMB}| \\cos\\theta = (E_\\gamma/c)(\\epsilon/c)\\cos\\theta = E_\\gamma \\epsilon \\cos\\theta$ (in units where c=1).\n\nThus, the invariant mass squared is:\n$s = 2E_\\gamma \\epsilon (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the two incoming photons.\n\nThe reaction has a threshold when the invariant mass squared is equal to the square of the minimum energy required in the CM frame:\n$s_{th} = (E_{CM, min})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\nTo find the minimum energy $E_\\gamma$ for the reaction to occur, we need to find the condition that makes the interaction most efficient. This happens in a head-on collision, where the photons travel directly towards each other ($\\theta = \\pi$ or 180°). In this case, $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$, and the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized at $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nSetting the expressions for the threshold equal:\n$2E_\\gamma \\epsilon (1 - (-1)) = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n$4E_\\gamma \\epsilon = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values:\n- Rest energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n- Average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$).\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.

Consider the annihilation of high energy $\\gamma$-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.\n\nA) 1.8*1e5 GeV\nB) 2.6*1e5 GeV\nC) 9.5*1e4 GeV\nD) 3.9*1e5 GeV\n\n### Reasoning and Solution\n\n1.  **Physical Principle**: The problem describes the process of pair production from two photons: a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) and a low-energy Cosmic Microwave Background photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$). The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$. To find the minimum energy (threshold energy) of the high-energy gamma-ray for this reaction to be possible, we use the principle of conservation of four-momentum.\n\n2.  **Invariant Mass and Threshold Condition**: Let the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray, the CMB photon, the electron, and the positron be $P_{\\gamma}$, $P_{CMB}$, $P_{e^-}$, and $P_{e^+}$, respectively. The conservation of four-momentum is:\n    $P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB} = P_{e^-} + P_{e^+}$\n\n    To find the threshold energy, we square both sides of the equation. The square of a four-momentum vector is a Lorentz-invariant quantity.\n    $(P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = (P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2$\n\n    *   **Left Side**: We expand the left side: $P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB}$. Since photons are massless, their rest mass is zero, and thus the square of their four-momentum is zero ($P^2 = (mc^2)^2 = 0$). The expression simplifies to $2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB}$.\n\n    *   **Right Side**: The term $(P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2$ represents the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the final products. At the threshold energy, the electron and positron are created with the minimum possible kinetic energy (i.e., they are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame). The total energy in this frame is just the sum of their rest energies, $m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$. Therefore, at threshold, $(P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n    *   **Combining them**: At threshold, we have the equation:\n        $2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n3.  **Four-Momentum Dot Product**: The dot product of the two photon four-momenta is given by $P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For a photon, the magnitude of its momentum is equal to its energy ($p=E$, in units where $c=1$). So, $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n    Thus, $P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Finding the Minimum Gamma-Ray Energy**: To find the minimum threshold energy for the high-energy photon ($E_{\\gamma}$), we need to consider the most energetically favorable condition for the reaction to occur. This happens when the interaction term $E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. The term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ has its maximum value when the collision is head-on, meaning the photons travel in opposite directions ($\\theta = \\pi$ or 180°). In this case, $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$, and $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Substituting this maximum value back into our threshold equation:\n    $2 [E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(2)] = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $4 E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   Electron rest mass energy, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average CMB photon energy, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 2.61 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    Finally, we convert this energy to Giga-electron-volts (GeV), knowing that $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{2.61 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value corresponds to the threshold energy above which gamma-rays will significantly interact with the CMB, limiting their mean free path in the universe.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nD) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV is in excellent agreement with option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe process in question is the pair production from a photon-photon collision: $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$. We need to find the minimum energy ($E_{\\gamma}$) of the high-energy gamma-ray for this reaction to be possible. This minimum energy is called the threshold energy.\n\n**1. Relativistic Kinematics and Invariant Mass**\n\nLet the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon be $p_{\\gamma}$ and $p_{CMB}$, respectively. Let the four-momenta of the produced electron and positron be $p_{e^{-}}$ and $p_{e^{+}}$.\n\nThe conservation of four-momentum states:\n$p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB} = p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}}$\n\nTo simplify the problem, we use the concept of invariant mass. The square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant quantity, meaning it is the same in all inertial reference frames. We can equate the square of the total four-momentum before and after the collision.\n\n$(p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = (p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}})^2$\n\n**2. Calculating the Invariant Mass of the Initial State**\n\nThe left side of the equation can be expanded:\n$(p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = p_{\\gamma}^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n\nFor any particle, its four-momentum squared is equal to its rest mass squared ($p^2 = m^2c^4$). Since photons are massless, $p_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$(p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n\nThe dot product of the two four-momenta is $p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For photons, the magnitude of the momentum is equal to the energy ($|\\vec{p}| = E/c$, or $p=E$ in natural units where c=1). Thus:\n$\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n\nSo, the invariant mass of the initial state is:\n$2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = 2(E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta) = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)$\n\n**3. Calculating the Invariant Mass of the Final State at Threshold**\n\nThe right side of the conservation equation is $(p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}})^2$. At the threshold energy, the electron and positron are created with the minimum possible energy. In the center-of-mass frame of the collision, this means they are created at rest.\n\nIn this frame, the total energy of the final state is simply the sum of the rest energies of the electron and the positron: $E_{total, CM} = m_ec^2 + m_ec^2 = 2m_ec^2$. The total momentum in the CM frame is zero.\n\nThe invariant mass squared of the final system is:\n$(p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}})^2 = (E_{total, CM})^2 - (\\vec{p}_{total, CM})^2 = (2m_ec^2)^2 - 0^2 = 4(m_ec^2)^2$\n\n**4. Finding the Threshold Energy**\n\nNow, we equate the two sides:\n$2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta) = 4(m_ec^2)^2$\n\nWe can solve for the energy of the high-energy photon, $E_{\\gamma}$:\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{4(m_ec^2)^2}{2E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)} = \\frac{2(m_ec^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)}$\n\nTo find the minimum threshold energy for $E_{\\gamma}$, we need to maximize the denominator. This happens when the interaction is a head-on collision, meaning the photons are moving directly towards each other. In this case, the angle $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (180°), and $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\nThe term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ becomes $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this maximum value, we get the minimum threshold energy:\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2(m_ec^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(2)} = \\frac{(m_ec^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Rest energy of an electron, $m_ec^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's plug these into the formula:\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$):\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV} = 2.61 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe interaction between a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) and a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon can result in the creation of an electron-positron pair ($e^{+}e^{-}$). This process, known as pair production, is represented by the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least the rest mass energy of the resulting electron and positron.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning\n\n1.  **Invariant Mass:** We use the concept of invariant mass squared, $s$, which is conserved in any interaction and is the same in all inertial reference frames. For a system of two colliding particles, $s$ is given by:\n    $s = (E_1 + E_2)^2 - (\\vec{p}_1c + \\vec{p}_2c)^2$\n    where $E_1, E_2$ are the energies and $\\vec{p}_1, \\vec{p}_2$ are the momenta of the two particles.\n\n2.  **Applying to Two Photons:** For two photons, their energy-momentum relation is $E=|\\vec{p}|c$. Let the high-energy gamma-ray have energy $E_{\\gamma}$ and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$. The invariant mass squared of this two-photon system is:\n    $s = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between the paths of the two photons.\n\n3.  **Threshold Condition:** For pair production to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest energy of the products. At the threshold energy, the electron and positron are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame. The total rest energy of the electron-positron pair is $2m_e c^2$.\n    The invariant mass squared, $s$, is equal to the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the minimum required value for $s$ is:\n    $s_{threshold} = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n\n4.  **Finding the Minimum $E_{\\gamma}$:** To find the minimum or threshold energy for the incoming gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma}$), we need to consider the most energetically favorable condition for the reaction. This occurs when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is at its maximum value. The maximum occurs for a head-on collision, where $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (180°), and $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$. In this case, $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 2$.\n\n5.  **Deriving the Threshold Energy Equation:** By setting the initial invariant mass squared equal to the threshold value for a head-on collision, we get:\n    $2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(2) = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n    $4E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Calculation:** Now, we insert the known values:\n    *   Electron rest energy: $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n    *   Average CMB photon energy: $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    The question asks for the energy in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.

Gamma-rays with energy above this threshold will have their lifetime in the universe significantly limited by this pair-production process, making the universe opaque to them over cosmological distances.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray (γ₁) that can interact with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon (γ₂) to produce an electron-positron pair (e⁻e⁺). The reaction is γ₁ + γ₂ → e⁺ + e⁻.\n\n**1. Conservation of Four-Momentum**\nThe fundamental principle governing this interaction is the conservation of relativistic four-momentum. The total four-momentum before the collision must equal the total four-momentum after the collision. Let P₁, P₂, P₃, and P₄ be the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray, the CMB photon, the electron, and the positron, respectively.\nP₁ + P₂ = P₃ + P₄\n\n**2. Lorentz Invariance**\nTo solve for the energy, we use the fact that the square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames. We can square both sides of the conservation equation:\n(P₁ + P₂)² = (P₃ + P₄)²\n\n**3. Expanding the Equation**\nLet's expand the terms:\nP₁² + P₂² + 2(P₁ ⋅ P₂) = (P₃ + P₄)²\n\n*   **Left Side:** Photons are massless particles, so the square of their four-momentum is zero (P² = (mc²)² = 0 for m=0). Therefore, P₁² = 0 and P₂² = 0.\n    The left side simplifies to 2(P₁ ⋅ P₂). The dot product of the two four-momenta is P₁ ⋅ P₂ = E₁E₂/c² - **p₁** ⋅ **p₂**. Since for a photon |**p**| = E/c, this becomes P₁ ⋅ P₂ = (E₁E₂ - E₁E₂cosθ)/c², where θ is the angle between the direction of the two photons. So, the left side of the equation is 2E₁E₂(1 - cosθ)/c².\n\n*   **Right Side:** The term (P₃ + P₄)² is the squared invariant mass of the final electron-positron system. This is easiest to evaluate in the center-of-mass frame. The threshold energy is the minimum energy required to create the particles, which means the electron and positron are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, the total energy is the sum of their rest energies, E_cm = mₑc² + mₑc² = 2mₑc², and the total momentum is zero.\n    Thus, (P₃ + P₄)² = (E_cm/c)² - **p**² = (2mₑc²)²/c² = 4(mₑc²)².\n\n**4. Finding the Threshold Energy**\nCombining both sides, we get:\n2E₁E₂(1 - cosθ)/c² = 4(mₑc²)²\nE₁E₂(1 - cosθ) = 2(mₑc²)²\n\nTo find the minimum energy E₁ required for this reaction to happen, we must consider the most favorable condition for the interaction. This occurs when the term (1 - cosθ) is at its maximum value. The maximum occurs when the two photons collide head-on, meaning they travel in opposite directions (θ = 180° or π radians), which gives cosθ = -1.\nSubstituting cosθ = -1 into the equation:\nE₁E₂(1 - (-1)) = 2(mₑc²)²\n2E₁E₂ = 2(mₑc²)²\nE₁E₂ = (mₑc²)²\n\nSolving for the high-energy photon's energy, E₁:\nE₁ = (mₑc²)² / E₂\n\n**5.

When high-energy gamma rays travel through the universe, they can interact with the low-energy photons of the CMB. One of the possible interactions is pair production, where the two photons annihilate to create an electron-positron pair:\n\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-} $$\n\nThis process can only occur if there is enough energy in the center-of-mass frame to create the rest mass of the electron and positron. We need to find the minimum (threshold) energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_\\gamma$, for this reaction to happen.\n\n### Reasoning and Calculation\n\n1.  **Conservation of Four-Momentum**: The threshold energy can be determined using the conservation of energy and momentum. We use the concept of invariant mass. The square of the total four-momentum must be the same before and after the collision.\n    Let $P_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma/c, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ be the four-momentum of the high-energy gamma-ray, and $P_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}/c, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$ be the four-momentum of the CMB photon. After the collision, we have an electron-positron pair.\n\n2.  **Center-of-Mass Energy**: The total energy squared in the center-of-mass frame, $s$, is a Lorentz invariant quantity:\n    $$ s = (P_\\gamma + P_{CMB})^2 = P_\\gamma^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2 P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB} $$\n    Since photons are massless, the square of their four-momentum is zero ($P^2 = (E/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = 0$). So, $P_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $P_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    The dot product of the four-momenta is $P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - |\\vec{p}_\\gamma||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons. Since $|\\vec{p}| = E$ for photons (in units where $c=1$), this becomes:\n    $$ s = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\n\n3.  **Threshold Condition**: For the reaction to create an electron-positron pair, the center-of-mass energy must be at least the total rest mass energy of the pair. The rest mass of an electron is $m_e$, and so is the rest mass of a positron. Thus, the minimum energy required in the center-of-mass frame is $2m_e c^2$.\n    Therefore, the threshold condition is:\n    $$ \\sqrt{s}_{min} = 2 m_e c^2 \\implies s_{min} = (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\n    Combining this with our expression for $s$:\n    $$ 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\ge (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\n\n4.  **Finding the Minimum Energy**: We want to find the lowest possible energy $E_\\gamma$ for which the reaction can occur. The reaction is most likely (i.e., requires the least energy for the incoming gamma-ray) when the interaction is most efficient. This occurs in a head-on collision, where the photons travel in opposite directions ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians). In this case, $\\cos\\theta = -1$, and the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ reaches its maximum value of 2.\n    The threshold condition for a head-on collision becomes:\n    $$ 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - (-1)) = 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\n    Solving for the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n    $$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(2 m_e c^2)^2}{4 E_{CMB}} = \\frac{4 (m_e c^2)^2}{4 E_{CMB}} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}} $$\n\n5.  **Plugging in the Values**:\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    Now, we can calculate the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n    $$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n    $$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\n6.  **Converting to GeV**: The options are in Giga-electron-volts (GeV). Since $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n    $$ E_\\gamma \\approx \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} \\approx 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\nThis result, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, means that gamma rays with energies at or above this value will have their propagation distance (and thus lifetime) significantly limited by pair production interactions with CMB photons.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The question describes the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). This is a pair production process, represented by the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Threshold Condition:** For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame ($\\sqrt{s}$) must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the particles being created. The products are an electron and a positron, each with a rest mass energy of $m_e c^2$. Therefore, the minimum energy required is:\n    $\\sqrt{s} \\ge 2m_e c^2$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Center-of-Mass Energy:** The center-of-mass energy squared ($s$) for a collision between two photons with energies $E_\\gamma$ (high-energy gamma-ray) and $\\epsilon$ (CMB photon) approaching each other at an angle $\\theta$ is given by the relativistic invariant:\n    $s = E_{cm}^2 = (p_1 + p_2)^2 = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + 2p_1 \\cdot p_2 = 0 + 0 + 2(E_\\gamma \\epsilon - \\vec{p_1}\\cdot\\vec{p_2}) = 2E_\\gamma\\epsilon(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    where we used the fact that for photons, the four-momentum squared is $p^2=0$ and the magnitude of the 3-momentum is $|\\vec{p}| = E/c$.\n\n4.  **Find the Minimum Energy Threshold:** The lifetime of the gamma-ray will be limited if it has enough energy to undergo this reaction. We need to find the minimum energy $E_\\gamma$ for which this is possible. This occurs when the reaction is most efficient, which is a head-on collision ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians).

    "The task is to determine the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray to undergo pair production by annihilating with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).\n\n### Step-by-step analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The reaction is photon-photon annihilation producing an electron-positron pair: $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$.\n\n2.  **Threshold Condition in the Center-of-Mass Frame:** The minimum energy required for this reaction to occur (the threshold energy) is when the final particles, the electron and positron, are created with zero kinetic energy in their center-of-mass (CM) frame.

In this case, we are creating an electron ($e^{-}$) and a positron ($e^{+}$), which have identical rest masses ($m_e$).\n    The minimum required energy in the CM frame is:\n    $\\sqrt{s}_{min} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$\n    where 's' is the Mandelstam variable, representing the square of the center-of-mass energy.\n\n3.  **Use Lorentz Invariance:** The quantity 's' is a Lorentz invariant, which means it has the same value in all inertial reference frames. We can calculate its value in the laboratory frame, where we observe a high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) colliding with a stationary CMB photon ($\\epsilon_{CMB}$).\n    The four-momentum of the high-energy photon is $p_1 = (E_\\gamma/c, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ and for the CMB photon is $p_2 = (\\epsilon_{CMB}/c, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$.\n    The invariant mass squared 's' is given by $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2$. This expands to:\n    $s = 2 E_\\gamma \\epsilon_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between the propagation directions of the two photons.\n\n4.  **Find the minimum gamma-ray energy:** We want to find the lowest possible energy $E_\\gamma$ for which the reaction can occur.

This is the energy threshold above which high-energy gamma-rays have their mean free path in the universe drastically shortened due to interactions with the CMB, effectively limiting their \"lifetime\" or observable distance.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe problem asks for the energy threshold of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can interact with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{-}e^{+}$). This process is known as pair production. The reaction is:\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+} $$\n\nTo solve this, we will use the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum and the concept of Lorentz invariance.\n\n1.  **Four-Momentum Conservation:**\n    Let the four-momenta of the initial particles be $P_{\\gamma}$ for the high-energy photon and $P_{CMB}$ for the CMB photon. Let the four-momenta of the final particles be $P_{e^{-}}$ for the electron and $P_{e^{+}}$ for the positron. The conservation of four-momentum states:\n    $$ P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB} = P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}} $$\n\n2.  **Invariant Mass:**\n    The square of the total four-momentum, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames.\n    $$ s = (P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = (P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2 $$\n\n3.  **Center-of-Mass Frame at Threshold:**\n    The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. This occurs when the final particles (electron and positron) are created with zero kinetic energy in their center-of-mass (CM) frame. In this frame, they are produced at rest.\n    The total energy in the CM frame at threshold is the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron:\n    $$ E_{CM} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2 $$\n    Since the particles are at rest in this frame, their total momentum is zero. The square of the total four-momentum of the final state is:\n    $$ (P_{e^{-}} + P_{e^{+}})^2 = \\left(\\frac{E_{CM}}{c}\\right)^2 = (2m_e c)^2 = 4m_e^2 c^2 $$\n\n4.  **Laboratory Frame:**\n    Now, let's evaluate the square of the initial four-momentum in the laboratory frame (our frame of reference).\n    $$ (P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} $$\n    For photons, the rest mass is zero, so their four-momentum squared is zero ($P^2 = (mc)^2 = 0$). Thus, $P_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $P_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $$ (P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} $$\n    The dot product of the four-momenta is $P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}c^2$ (using units where c=1 is common, but we will keep c for clarity: $P_{\\mu} = (E/c, \\vec{p})$, so $P_1 \\cdot P_2 = E_1E_2/c^2 - \\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2$).\n    Since $E=|\\vec{p}|c$ for photons, this becomes:\n    $$ P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = \\frac{E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2} - \\frac{E_{\\gamma}}{c}\\frac{E_{CMB}}{c}\\cos\\theta = \\frac{E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two incoming photons.\n    So, in the lab frame, $s = \\frac{2 E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n5.  **Solving for the Threshold Energy:**\n    Equating the expressions for $s$ from the CM frame and the lab frame:\n    $$ 4m_e^2 c^2 = \\frac{2 E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\n    Solving for the gamma-ray energy $E_{\\gamma}$:\n    $$ E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{4m_e^2 c^4}{2E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)} $$\n    To find the *minimum* or *threshold* energy ($E_{\\gamma, th}$) for the high-energy photon, we need to consider the most efficient collision scenario. This corresponds to maximizing the denominator, which occurs when $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximum. The maximum value is 2, which happens when $\\theta = \\pi$ (a head-on collision).\n    $$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(1 - (-1))} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{2E_{CMB}} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}} $$\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron is a known constant, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\n    Plugging these values into the threshold energy formula:\n    $$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n    The question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $$ E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nThis result, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, is known as the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit for photons.

The reaction is:\n\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$\n\nThis process is a classic example of pair production from photon-photon annihilation. We can solve this by considering the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum.\n\nLet the four-momenta of the particles be:\n*   High-energy gamma-ray: $P_{\\gamma} = (E_{\\gamma}, \\vec{p}_{\\gamma})$\n*   CMB photon: $P_{\\epsilon} = (\\epsilon, \\vec{p}_{\\epsilon})$\n*   Electron: $P_{e^-}$\n*   Positron: $P_{e^+}$\n\nHere, $E_{\\gamma}$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, and $\\epsilon$ is the energy of the CMB photon. The rest mass of both the electron and the positron is $m_e$. We will use natural units where the speed of light $c=1$.\n\nThe conservation of four-momentum states:\n$P_{\\gamma} + P_{\\epsilon} = P_{e^-} + P_{e^+}$\n\nA useful technique is to square the total four-momentum, as this quantity (the Mandelstam variable $s$) is Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames of reference.\n\n$s = (P_{\\gamma} + P_{\\epsilon})^2 = (P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2$\n\nLet's evaluate the left side in the lab frame (where we observe the collision). For photons, the square of their four-momentum is zero ($P^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = 0$).\n$(P_{\\gamma} + P_{\\epsilon})^2 = P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{\\epsilon}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{\\epsilon} = 0 + 0 + 2 (E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{\\epsilon})$\nSince $|\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}| = E_{\\gamma}$ and $|\\vec{p}_{\\epsilon}| = \\epsilon$, the dot product is $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{\\epsilon} = E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\nSo, $s = 2E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the right side at the threshold energy. The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. In the center-of-mass (CM) frame, this corresponds to the electron and positron being created at rest.\nIn the CM frame at threshold:\n*   Electron momentum: $\\vec{p}_{e^-} = 0$, Energy: $E_{e^-} = m_e$\n*   Positron momentum: $\\vec{p}_{e^+} = 0$, Energy: $E_{e^+} = m_e$\nThe total four-momentum of the final state in the CM frame is $P_{final, CM} = (m_e + m_e, \\vec{0}) = (2m_e, \\vec{0})$.\nThe square of this is $(P_{final, CM})^2 = (2m_e)^2 = 4m_e^2$.\n\nSince $s$ is Lorentz invariant, we can equate the expressions from the lab frame and the CM frame:\n$2E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4m_e^2$\n\nWe are looking for the threshold energy $E_{\\gamma, th}$. To initiate the reaction, the incoming gamma-ray must have at least this energy. The energy required is lowest when the interaction is most efficient. From the equation, $E_{\\gamma}$ is minimized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This occurs for a head-on collision, where the photons travel towards each other, so $\\theta = \\pi$ and $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\nIn this case, $(1 - \\cos\\pi) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nThe equation for the minimum threshold energy becomes:\n$2E_{\\gamma, th}\\epsilon(2) = 4m_e^2$\n$4E_{\\gamma, th}\\epsilon = 4m_e^2$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{m_e^2}{\\epsilon}$\n\nNow, we plug in the given and known values:\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Rest mass of an electron, $m_e = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, represents the energy threshold above which high-energy gamma-rays have their mean free path (and thus their \"lifetime\" in the universe) significantly limited by pair production with CMB photons.

The most straightforward method is to use the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, the square of the total four-momentum of the system. This quantity is the same in all inertial reference frames.\n\n2.  **Analysis in the Center-of-Momentum (CM) Frame**:\n    At the threshold for the reaction, the final particles (electron $e^{-}$ and positron $e^{+}$) are created with the minimum possible kinetic energy, which is zero in the CM frame. They are essentially created at rest.\n    *   The rest energy of an electron is $m_e c^2$.\n    *   The rest energy of a positron is also $m_e c^2$.\n    *   The total energy in the CM frame at the threshold is the sum of the rest energies of the produced particles: $E_{CM, \\text{threshold}} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n    *   The square of the total four-momentum, $s$, in the CM frame at the threshold is $s_{\\text{threshold}} = (E_{CM, \\text{threshold}})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n3.  **Analysis in the Laboratory (Lab) Frame**:\n    In the lab frame, we have a high-energy gamma-ray with energy $E_\\gamma$ colliding with a CMB photon of energy $E_{CMB}$.\n    *   The four-momentum of the high-energy photon is $p_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$.\n    *   The four-momentum of the CMB photon is $p_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$.\n    *   The invariant $s$ is calculated as $s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$.\n    *   Since photons are massless, their four-momentum squared is zero ($p^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 c^2 = 0$). So, $p_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    *   This simplifies the expression to $s = 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$.\n    *   The dot product of the four-momenta is $p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For photons, $|\\vec{p}| = E$. Thus, $\\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_\\gamma| |\\vec{p}_{CMB}| \\cos\\theta = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n    *   Substituting this back, we get $s = 2(E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\cos\\theta) = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Finding the Threshold Energy**:\n    The threshold energy $E_\\gamma$ is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. For a given $E_\\gamma$, the maximum energy is made available for particle creation when the collision is head-on ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians), which makes $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\n    *   At this angle, $s$ is maximized for a given $E_\\gamma$: $s = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - (-1)) = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$.\n\n5.  **Equating and Solving**:\n    Now, we equate the expressions for the threshold $s$ from both the CM and Lab frames:\n    $4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n    Solving for the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    We use the known physical constants and the given value for the CMB photon energy.\n    *   Rest energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    The question asks for the answer in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion**:\n    The calculated threshold energy is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.

This process is known as pair production. The reaction is:\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+} $$\nWe need to find the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) for this reaction to occur.\n\n### 1. Kinematic Threshold Condition\nFor any reaction, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least the total rest mass energy of the products. The products here are an electron and a positron. The rest mass of an electron is $m_e$, and so is the rest mass of a positron. The rest mass energy of each is $m_e c^2$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum required energy in the CM frame, denoted as $\\sqrt{s}_{min}$, is:\n$$ \\sqrt{s}_{min} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2 $$\nThe threshold condition for the reaction is that the square of the center-of-mass energy, $s$, must be greater than or equal to the square of the minimum required energy:\n$$ s \\ge (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\n\n### 2. Lorentz Invariant Quantity\nThe quantity $s$ is a Lorentz invariant, meaning its value is the same in any inertial frame of reference. We can calculate it in the lab frame using the four-momenta of the initial particles (the two photons).\n\nLet $p_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ be the four-momentum of the high-energy photon and $p_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$ be the four-momentum of the CMB photon. The invariant mass squared $s$ is:\n$$ s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} $$\nFor photons, which are massless, the square of the four-momentum is zero ($p^2 = 0$). The equation simplifies to:\n$$ s = 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} $$\nThe dot product of the two four-momenta is $p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. Since for a photon $| \\vec{p} | c = E$, we can write this as:\n$$ s = 2(E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\cos\\theta) = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the propagation directions of the two photons.\n\n### 3. Determining the Threshold Energy\nCombining the threshold condition with the expression for $s$:\n$$ 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\ge (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\nWe are looking for the minimum energy $E_\\gamma$ for this reaction to be possible. This minimum threshold is reached under the most favorable condition for the reaction, which is when the left side of the equation is maximized for a given $E_\\gamma$. This occurs for a head-on collision, where the photons travel in opposite directions. In this case, the angle $\\theta = 180^\\circ$ (or $\\pi$ radians), and $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\nThis maximizes the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ to its highest possible value of $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this value into the inequality:\n$$ 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (2) \\ge (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\n$$ 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\ge 4 (m_e c^2)^2 $$\n$$ E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\ge (m_e c^2)^2 $$\nThe threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_{\\gamma,th}$, is therefore given by:\n$$ E_{\\gamma,th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}} $$\n\n### 4. Calculation\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$, is a known physical constant, approximately $0.511 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nLet's convert all units to electron-volts (eV):\n*   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n*   $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the threshold energy:\n$$ E_{\\gamma,th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV).

The square of the total four-momentum is:\n$s = (P_\\gamma + P_{CMB})^2 = P_\\gamma^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB}$\n\nSince photons are massless, $P_\\gamma^2 = P_{CMB}^2 = 0$. The dot product is $P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_\\gamma \\epsilon - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For photons, $|\\vec{p}| = E/c$.

This happens in a head-on collision, where the photons travel directly towards each other ($\\theta = \\pi$ or 180°).

The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$. To find the minimum energy (threshold energy) of the high-energy gamma-ray for this reaction to be possible, we use the principle of conservation of four-momentum.\n\n2.  **Invariant Mass and Threshold Condition**: Let the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray, the CMB photon, the electron, and the positron be $P_{\\gamma}$, $P_{CMB}$, $P_{e^-}$, and $P_{e^+}$, respectively. The conservation of four-momentum is:\n    $P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB} = P_{e^-} + P_{e^+}$\n\n    To find the threshold energy, we square both sides of the equation. The square of a four-momentum vector is a Lorentz-invariant quantity.\n    $(P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = (P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2$\n\n    *   **Left Side**: We expand the left side: $P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB}$. Since photons are massless, their rest mass is zero, and thus the square of their four-momentum is zero ($P^2 = (mc^2)^2 = 0$). The expression simplifies to $2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB}$.\n\n    *   **Right Side**: The term $(P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2$ represents the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the final products. At the threshold energy, the electron and positron are created with the minimum possible kinetic energy (i.e., they are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame). The total energy in this frame is just the sum of their rest energies, $m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$. Therefore, at threshold, $(P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n    *   **Combining them**: At threshold, we have the equation:\n        $2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n3.  **Four-Momentum Dot Product**: The dot product of the two photon four-momenta is given by $P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For a photon, the magnitude of its momentum is equal to its energy ($p=E$, in units where $c=1$). So, $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n    Thus, $P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Finding the Minimum Gamma-Ray Energy**: To find the minimum threshold energy for the high-energy photon ($E_{\\gamma}$), we need to consider the most energetically favorable condition for the reaction to occur. This happens when the interaction term $E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. The term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ has its maximum value when the collision is head-on, meaning the photons travel in opposite directions ($\\theta = \\pi$ or 180°). In this case, $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$, and $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Substituting this maximum value back into our threshold equation:\n    $2 [E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(2)] = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $4 E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   Electron rest mass energy, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average CMB photon energy, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 2.61 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    Finally, we convert this energy to Giga-electron-volts (GeV), knowing that $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{2.61 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value corresponds to the threshold energy above which gamma-rays will significantly interact with the CMB, limiting their mean free path in the universe.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nD) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV is in excellent agreement with option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe process in question is the pair production from a photon-photon collision: $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$. We need to find the minimum energy ($E_{\\gamma}$) of the high-energy gamma-ray for this reaction to be possible. This minimum energy is called the threshold energy.\n\n**1. Relativistic Kinematics and Invariant Mass**\n\nLet the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon be $p_{\\gamma}$ and $p_{CMB}$, respectively. Let the four-momenta of the produced electron and positron be $p_{e^{-}}$ and $p_{e^{+}}$.\n\nThe conservation of four-momentum states:\n$p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB} = p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}}$\n\nTo simplify the problem, we use the concept of invariant mass. The square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant quantity, meaning it is the same in all inertial reference frames. We can equate the square of the total four-momentum before and after the collision.\n\n$(p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = (p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}})^2$\n\n**2. Calculating the Invariant Mass of the Initial State**\n\nThe left side of the equation can be expanded:\n$(p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = p_{\\gamma}^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n\nFor any particle, its four-momentum squared is equal to its rest mass squared ($p^2 = m^2c^4$). Since photons are massless, $p_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$(p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n\nThe dot product of the two four-momenta is $p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For photons, the magnitude of the momentum is equal to the energy ($|\\vec{p}| = E/c$, or $p=E$ in natural units where c=1). Thus:\n$\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n\nSo, the invariant mass of the initial state is:\n$2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = 2(E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta) = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)$\n\n**3. Calculating the Invariant Mass of the Final State at Threshold**\n\nThe right side of the conservation equation is $(p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}})^2$. At the threshold energy, the electron and positron are created with the minimum possible energy. In the center-of-mass frame of the collision, this means they are created at rest.\n\nIn this frame, the total energy of the final state is simply the sum of the rest energies of the electron and the positron: $E_{total, CM} = m_ec^2 + m_ec^2 = 2m_ec^2$. The total momentum in the CM frame is zero.\n\nThe invariant mass squared of the final system is:\n$(p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}})^2 = (E_{total, CM})^2 - (\\vec{p}_{total, CM})^2 = (2m_ec^2)^2 - 0^2 = 4(m_ec^2)^2$\n\n**4. Finding the Threshold Energy**\n\nNow, we equate the two sides:\n$2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta) = 4(m_ec^2)^2$\n\nWe can solve for the energy of the high-energy photon, $E_{\\gamma}$:\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{4(m_ec^2)^2}{2E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)} = \\frac{2(m_ec^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)}$\n\nTo find the minimum threshold energy for $E_{\\gamma}$, we need to maximize the denominator. This happens when the interaction is a head-on collision, meaning the photons are moving directly towards each other. In this case, the angle $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (180°), and $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\nThe term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ becomes $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this maximum value, we get the minimum threshold energy:\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2(m_ec^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(2)} = \\frac{(m_ec^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Rest energy of an electron, $m_ec^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's plug these into the formula:\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$):\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV} = 2.61 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe interaction between a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) and a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon can result in the creation of an electron-positron pair ($e^{+}e^{-}$). This process, known as pair production, is represented by the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least the rest mass energy of the resulting electron and positron.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning\n\n1.  **Invariant Mass:** We use the concept of invariant mass squared, $s$, which is conserved in any interaction and is the same in all inertial reference frames. For a system of two colliding particles, $s$ is given by:\n    $s = (E_1 + E_2)^2 - (\\vec{p}_1c + \\vec{p}_2c)^2$\n    where $E_1, E_2$ are the energies and $\\vec{p}_1, \\vec{p}_2$ are the momenta of the two particles.\n\n2.  **Applying to Two Photons:** For two photons, their energy-momentum relation is $E=|\\vec{p}|c$. Let the high-energy gamma-ray have energy $E_{\\gamma}$ and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$. The invariant mass squared of this two-photon system is:\n    $s = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between the paths of the two photons.\n\n3.  **Threshold Condition:** For pair production to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest energy of the products. At the threshold energy, the electron and positron are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame. The total rest energy of the electron-positron pair is $2m_e c^2$.\n    The invariant mass squared, $s$, is equal to the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the minimum required value for $s$ is:\n    $s_{threshold} = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n\n4.  **Finding the Minimum $E_{\\gamma}$:** To find the minimum or threshold energy for the incoming gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma}$), we need to consider the most energetically favorable condition for the reaction. This occurs when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is at its maximum value. The maximum occurs for a head-on collision, where $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (180°), and $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$. In this case, $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 2$.\n\n5.  **Deriving the Threshold Energy Equation:** By setting the initial invariant mass squared equal to the threshold value for a head-on collision, we get:\n    $2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(2) = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n    $4E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Calculation:** Now, we insert the known values:\n    *   Electron rest energy: $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n    *   Average CMB photon energy: $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    The question asks for the energy in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$. Comparing this with the options provided:\nA) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nB) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\nThe Python code output `261121.00` confirms this calculation, as $261121 \\text{ GeV} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$. Gamma-rays with energy above this threshold will have their lifetime in the universe significantly limited by this pair-production process, making the universe opaque to them over cosmological distances.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray (γ₁) that can interact with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon (γ₂) to produce an electron-positron pair (e⁻e⁺). The reaction is γ₁ + γ₂ → e⁺ + e⁻.\n\n**1. Conservation of Four-Momentum**\nThe fundamental principle governing this interaction is the conservation of relativistic four-momentum. The total four-momentum before the collision must equal the total four-momentum after the collision. Let P₁, P₂, P₃, and P₄ be the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray, the CMB photon, the electron, and the positron, respectively.\nP₁ + P₂ = P₃ + P₄\n\n**2. Lorentz Invariance**\nTo solve for the energy, we use the fact that the square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames. We can square both sides of the conservation equation:\n(P₁ + P₂)² = (P₃ + P₄)²\n\n**3. Expanding the Equation**\nLet's expand the terms:\nP₁² + P₂² + 2(P₁ ⋅ P₂) = (P₃ + P₄)²\n\n*   **Left Side:** Photons are massless particles, so the square of their four-momentum is zero (P² = (mc²)² = 0 for m=0). Therefore, P₁² = 0 and P₂² = 0.\n    The left side simplifies to 2(P₁ ⋅ P₂). The dot product of the two four-momenta is P₁ ⋅ P₂ = E₁E₂/c² - **p₁** ⋅ **p₂**. Since for a photon |**p**| = E/c, this becomes P₁ ⋅ P₂ = (E₁E₂ - E₁E₂cosθ)/c², where θ is the angle between the direction of the two photons. So, the left side of the equation is 2E₁E₂(1 - cosθ)/c².\n\n*   **Right Side:** The term (P₃ + P₄)² is the squared invariant mass of the final electron-positron system. This is easiest to evaluate in the center-of-mass frame. The threshold energy is the minimum energy required to create the particles, which means the electron and positron are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, the total energy is the sum of their rest energies, E_cm = mₑc² + mₑc² = 2mₑc², and the total momentum is zero.\n    Thus, (P₃ + P₄)² = (E_cm/c)² - **p**² = (2mₑc²)²/c² = 4(mₑc²)².\n\n**4. Finding the Threshold Energy**\nCombining both sides, we get:\n2E₁E₂(1 - cosθ)/c² = 4(mₑc²)²\nE₁E₂(1 - cosθ) = 2(mₑc²)²\n\nTo find the minimum energy E₁ required for this reaction to happen, we must consider the most favorable condition for the interaction. This occurs when the term (1 - cosθ) is at its maximum value. The maximum occurs when the two photons collide head-on, meaning they travel in opposite directions (θ = 180° or π radians), which gives cosθ = -1.\nSubstituting cosθ = -1 into the equation:\nE₁E₂(1 - (-1)) = 2(mₑc²)²\n2E₁E₂ = 2(mₑc²)²\nE₁E₂ = (mₑc²)²\n\nSolving for the high-energy photon's energy, E₁:\nE₁ = (mₑc²)² / E₂\n\n**5. Calculation**\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Rest mass energy of an electron, mₑc² ≈ 0.511 MeV = 5.11 × 10⁵ eV\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, E₂ = 10⁻³ eV\n\nNow, we plug these values into the equation:\nE₁ = (5.11 × 10⁵ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\nE₁ = (2.611 × 10¹¹ eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)\nE₁ = 2.611 × 10¹⁴ eV\n\nFinally, we convert this energy to GeV (1 GeV = 10⁹ eV):\nE₁ = (2.611 × 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)\nE₁ ≈ 2.61 × 10⁵ GeV\n\nThis value corresponds to option C. The calculation performed by the code `2.61e+05` GeV confirms this result.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. When high-energy gamma rays travel through the universe, they can interact with the low-energy photons of the CMB. One of the possible interactions is pair production, where the two photons annihilate to create an electron-positron pair:\n\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-} $$\n\nThis process can only occur if there is enough energy in the center-of-mass frame to create the rest mass of the electron and positron. We need to find the minimum (threshold) energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_\\gamma$, for this reaction to happen.\n\n### Reasoning and Calculation\n\n1.  **Conservation of Four-Momentum**: The threshold energy can be determined using the conservation of energy and momentum. We use the concept of invariant mass. The square of the total four-momentum must be the same before and after the collision.\n    Let $P_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma/c, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ be the four-momentum of the high-energy gamma-ray, and $P_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}/c, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$ be the four-momentum of the CMB photon. After the collision, we have an electron-positron pair.\n\n2.  **Center-of-Mass Energy**: The total energy squared in the center-of-mass frame, $s$, is a Lorentz invariant quantity:\n    $$ s = (P_\\gamma + P_{CMB})^2 = P_\\gamma^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2 P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB} $$\n    Since photons are massless, the square of their four-momentum is zero ($P^2 = (E/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = 0$). So, $P_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $P_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    The dot product of the four-momenta is $P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - |\\vec{p}_\\gamma||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons. Since $|\\vec{p}| = E$ for photons (in units where $c=1$), this becomes:\n    $$ s = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\n\n3.  **Threshold Condition**: For the reaction to create an electron-positron pair, the center-of-mass energy must be at least the total rest mass energy of the pair. The rest mass of an electron is $m_e$, and so is the rest mass of a positron. Thus, the minimum energy required in the center-of-mass frame is $2m_e c^2$.\n    Therefore, the threshold condition is:\n    $$ \\sqrt{s}_{min} = 2 m_e c^2 \\implies s_{min} = (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\n    Combining this with our expression for $s$:\n    $$ 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\ge (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\n\n4.  **Finding the Minimum Energy**: We want to find the lowest possible energy $E_\\gamma$ for which the reaction can occur. The reaction is most likely (i.e., requires the least energy for the incoming gamma-ray) when the interaction is most efficient. This occurs in a head-on collision, where the photons travel in opposite directions ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians). In this case, $\\cos\\theta = -1$, and the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ reaches its maximum value of 2.\n    The threshold condition for a head-on collision becomes:\n    $$ 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - (-1)) = 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = (2 m_e c^2)^2 $$\n    Solving for the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n    $$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(2 m_e c^2)^2}{4 E_{CMB}} = \\frac{4 (m_e c^2)^2}{4 E_{CMB}} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}} $$\n\n5.  **Plugging in the Values**:\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    Now, we can calculate the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n    $$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n    $$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\n6.  **Converting to GeV**: The options are in Giga-electron-volts (GeV).

This is a pair production process, represented by the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Threshold Condition:** For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame ($\\sqrt{s}$) must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the particles being created.

Therefore, the minimum energy required is:\n    $\\sqrt{s} \\ge 2m_e c^2$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Center-of-Mass Energy:** The center-of-mass energy squared ($s$) for a collision between two photons with energies $E_\\gamma$ (high-energy gamma-ray) and $\\epsilon$ (CMB photon) approaching each other at an angle $\\theta$ is given by the relativistic invariant:\n    $s = E_{cm}^2 = (p_1 + p_2)^2 = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + 2p_1 \\cdot p_2 = 0 + 0 + 2(E_\\gamma \\epsilon - \\vec{p_1}\\cdot\\vec{p_2}) = 2E_\\gamma\\epsilon(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    where we used the fact that for photons, the four-momentum squared is $p^2=0$ and the magnitude of the 3-momentum is $|\\vec{p}| = E/c$.\n\n4.  **Find the Minimum Energy Threshold:** The lifetime of the gamma-ray will be limited if it has enough energy to undergo this reaction. We need to find the minimum energy $E_\\gamma$ for which this is possible. This occurs when the reaction is most efficient, which is a head-on collision ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians). In this case, $\\cos(180^\\circ) = -1$, and the expression for $s$ is maximized:\n    $s = 2E_\\gamma\\epsilon(1 - (-1)) = 4E_\\gamma\\epsilon$\n\n5.  **Combine and Solve for E_gamma:** Now we set the center-of-mass energy for a head-on collision equal to the required product rest mass energy:\n    $4E_\\gamma \\epsilon = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n    $4E_\\gamma \\epsilon = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon}$\n    This equation gives the minimum (threshold) energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n\n6.  **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n8.  **Convert to Appropriate Units:** The options are given in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$).\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is $E_\\gamma \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.
