The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.\n\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    Let the formula of the binary compound A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given as 31.96%.\n    The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Solving for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n2.  **Find plausible elements for Y.**\n    We need to find an element whose atomic mass M(Y) is approximately 40.45 times an integer n (which represents a plausible oxidation state/number of F atoms). Let's test integer values for n.\n    -   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 (closest is Ca, Ar - unlikely)\n    -   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 (closest is Br, Se - possible)\n    -   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 (closest is Sb, Antimony, M=121.76 g/mol)\n    -   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.80 (closest is Dy, Dysprosium, M=162.50 g/mol)\n    -   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 (closest are Au, Pt, Hg, Pb)\n    -   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.70 (closest is Pu, Plutonium, M≈244 g/mol)\n\n    To narrow this down, I will use a python script to check all elements for a close match.\n\n    ```python\n    import periodictable\n\n    def find_element():\n        # M(Y) = 40.4493 * n\n        best_fits = []\n        for element in periodictable.elements:\n            if element.mass and element.number > 2: # Exclude H, He and elements without a standard atomic weight\n                for n in range(1, 9):\n                    target_mass = 40.4493 * n\n                    error = abs(element.mass - target_mass) / element.mass * 100\n                    if error < 1.0: # We are looking for a very good fit, error < 1%\n                        best_fits.append((element.symbol, element.mass, n, target_mass, error))\n\n        # Sort by error to see the best fits first\n        best_fits.sort(key=lambda x: x[4])\n\n        for fit in best_fits:\n            print(f\"Element: {fit[0]}, M(Element): {fit[1]:.2f}, For n={fit[2]}, Calculated M(Y) is: {fit[3]:.2f}, Error: {fit[4]:.2f}%\")\n\n    find_element()\n    ```\n    The code output shows the best candidates based on the mass percentage.\n    ```\n    Element: Sb, M(Element): 121.76, For n=3, Calculated M(Y) is: 121.35, Error: 0.34%\n    Element: Dy, M(Element): 162.50, For n=4, Calculated M(Y) is: 161.80, Error: 0.43%\n    Element: Pu, M(Element): 244.06, For n=6, Calculated M(Y) is: 242.70, Error: 0.56%\n    ```\n\n3.  **Evaluate the best candidates against other clues.**\n    The problem states: \"A1 decomposes ... into A2 ... and fluorine (F2)\". This means the reaction is `A1 -> A2 + F2`. Chemically, this implies A1 is a higher fluoride of Y than A2 (i.e., A1 = YF_{m} and A2 = YF_{n} with m > n).\n\n    -   **Candidate Pu (Plutonium)**: If Y=Pu, then n=6, so A2 = PuF6. For the decomposition A1 -> PuF6 + F2 to occur, A1 would need to be a higher fluoride like PuF7 or PuF8, which are not known to exist. This rules out Pu.\n    -   **Candidate Dy (Dysprosium)**: If Y=Dy, then n=4, so A2 = DyF4. DyF4 is the highest known fluoride of dysprosium. A higher fluoride A1 does not exist. This rules out Dy.\n    -   **Candidate Sb (Antimony)**: If Y=Sb, then n=3, so A2 = SbF3. A known higher fluoride is SbF5. So, the reaction could be `SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2`. This is chemically plausible. A1 could be SbF5.\n\n4.  **Adopt Y=Sb and verify all clues.**\n    Let's assume Y is Antimony (Sb).\n    -   **Y = Sb**.\n    -   **A2 = SbF3**. (Mass % of F is 31.88%, a near-perfect match with the given 31.96%).\n    -   **A1 = SbF5**. This is required for the decomposition `A1 -> A2 + F2`.\n    -   Let's check the properties of A1=SbF5: The problem says A1 is \"bright-red\" and \"decomposes at 293 K\". Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is actually a colorless liquid/solid and is stable at room temperature. This is a significant discrepancy. However, given that other candidates led to chemical impossibilities, it is common in such complex problems that some descriptive data may be flawed. We will proceed assuming this is the case.\n    -   \"A1 oxidizes xenon\": SbF5 is an extremely strong Lewis acid and a powerful oxidizing agent. It reacts with Xenon to form [XeF]⁺[Sb₂F₁₁]⁻, which involves the oxidation of Xe. This clue fits.\n    -   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\". Fluorination of Sb yields SbF3 or SbF5. Since A3 interacts with xenon, it must be the strong oxidizer, **A3 = SbF5**. This is consistent with A1=A3.\n    -   \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" A4 is a binary fluoride of antimony. The solution is colorless. Both SbF3 and SbF5 form colorless solutions.\n    -   If A4 = SbF5, the reaction with Sb would be a comproportionation: `2 Sb + 3 SbF5 -> 5 SbF3`. The molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, not 1:1. So, A4 is not SbF5.\n    -   If A4 = SbF3, the reaction is `Sb + SbF3 -> A5`. The molar ratio is 1:1. This fits the description.\n    -   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" The product A5 would have an empirical formula of \"Sb2F3\", implying an intermediate oxidation state for antimony (+1.5). Such species are unstable and would readily decompose (disproportionate) in water. This also fits.\n\n5.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, the compound A4 must be Antimony Trifluoride (SbF3).\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(A4) = M(SbF3) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\n    M(A4) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n\n6.  **Select the correct range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol. We check which of the given ranges this value falls into:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 220-240\n\n    178.76 falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n. The molar mass of Y (M(Y)) can be related to the molar mass of fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) by the formula for mass fraction:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging for M(Y):\n    M(Y) = (n * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n * 19.00)\n    M(Y) ≈ n * (59.45 - 19.00)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We need to find an integer `n` that results in a realistic atomic mass for an element Y that is known to form multiple fluorides. Let's test integer values for `n`:\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to K, Ca, Ar). These don't fit the required chemical properties (multiple fluorides, reaction with xenon).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br, Se). Bromine and Selenium fluorides do not match the mass fraction.\n    *   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dy). Dysprosium chemistry does not fit well.\n    *   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Bi, Hg). The fit is not as good as for Sb.\n\n    Let's verify the mass fraction for SbF3:\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This is very close to the given 31.96% (an error of only ~0.25%), making it the most likely candidate.\n    Therefore, **Y = Sb (Antimony)** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of the Other Substances.**\n    *   **A1**: A bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (room temperature) into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. The reaction is A1 → SbF3 + F2. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony, containing Sb(V). The simplest would be SbF5. A1 also oxidizes xenon, a known property of strong fluorinating agents like SbF5. However, pure SbF5 is a colorless liquid and is relatively stable. A1 must be a different, less stable, and colored form or compound of Sb(V) fluoride.\n    *   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Sb with F2. This reaction can produce SbF3 or SbF5. A3 also interacts with xenon. SbF5 is a very strong Lewis acid and readily forms adducts with xenon fluorides (e.g., [XeF]+[SbF6]-), while SbF3 does not react with xenon. Therefore, **A3 = SbF5**.\n    *   This confirms that A1 and A3 are different substances, even though both contain Sb(V). This supports the idea that A1 is a special, unstable Sb(V) fluoride.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4.\n    *   A4 is one of the five known binary fluorides of antimony.\n    *   A5 is obtained by reacting Y (Sb) with A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction is Sb + A4 → A5.\n    *   This reaction takes place in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n\n    A4 is most likely one of the two common fluorides: SbF3 or SbF5.\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = SbF5.** The reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(V)F5 → A5. This is a comproportionation reaction, which is chemically very plausible. The product A5 would have the empirical formula Sb2F5. The description \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" fits well, as SbF5 is a colorless liquid.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = SbF3.** The reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(III)F3 → A5. This reaction to form a subfluoride (A5 would be Sb2F3) is also possible. SbF3 is a white/colorless solid, so a colorless solution can be made.\n\n4.  **Calculate Molecular Weights and Compare with Options.**\n    We need to determine whether A4 is SbF3 or SbF5. The provided options for the molecular weight range will be the deciding factor.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF3**: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF5**: M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n    Now let's check the given ranges:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 220-240\n\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit any range well. It is close to range D, but outside of it.\n\n    Given the perfect fit for SbF3, it is the only logical choice for A4.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, substance A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF3). Its molecular weight is approximately 178.76 g/mol, which falls in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2 using the Mass Percentage of Fluorine.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), and the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\n    The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 18.998 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    0.3196 = (n * 18.998) / (M_Y + n * 18.998)\n    Let's rearrange to solve for the atomic mass of Y (M_Y):\n    M_Y + n * 18.998 = (n * 18.998) / 0.3196\n    M_Y = (n * 18.998 / 0.3196) - (n * 18.998)\n    M_Y = n * 18.998 * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M_Y ≈ n * 40.45\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer n (oxidation state) that satisfy this relationship. We can test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca at 40.08 g/mol)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (closest is Br at 79.90 g/mol)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb at 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (closest is Dy at 162.50 g/mol)\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Bi at 208.98 g/mol)\n\n    Let's calculate the exact fluorine percentage for the most promising candidate, Antimony (Sb) with n=3.\n    Y = Sb (M_Y = 121.76 g/mol), A2 = SbF3.\n    ɷF in SbF3 = (3 * 18.998) / (121.76 + 3 * 18.998) = 56.994 / 178.754 = 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a relative difference of only about 0.25%. This is a very strong indication that Y is Sb and A2 is SbF3.\n\n2.  **Identify the Other Compounds based on Y=Sb.**\n    *   **A2 = SbF3**.\n    *   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride of antimony. The most common and stable higher fluoride is SbF5. So, **A1 = SbF5**. The reaction is SbF5 → SbF3 + F2.\n    *   **Contradictions**: The problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes at 293 K and \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\". SbF5 is a colorless liquid, is relatively stable at 293 K (decomposes at higher temperatures), and while a strong oxidizer, its reaction with xenon is not as famously spontaneous as PtF6. In complex chemical puzzles, it's common for some qualitative descriptions to be slightly inaccurate or misleading, whereas numerical data is usually precise. Given the excellent numerical fit, we proceed with the Y=Sb hypothesis.\n    *   **A3**: A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and can interact with xenon. Fluorinating antimony can produce SbF3 or SbF5. Since it interacts with xenon (implying strong oxidizing/Lewis acidic properties), **A3 = SbF5**. This is consistent with A1=A3.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: A5 is obtained by adding Y (Sb) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. A4 is one of the five binary fluorides. For antimony, the main two are SbF3 and SbF5.\n\n3.  **Determine A4 by Checking the Answer Options.**\n    We need to find the molecular weight range for A4. Let's calculate the molecular weights of the possible compounds for A4 (SbF3 and SbF5) and see which one fits the given ranges.\n    *   **MW of SbF3**: 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    *   **MW of SbF5**: 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n    Now, let's look at the options:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 220-240\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.754 g/mol) falls squarely into range **A) 160-180**.\n    The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.75 g/mol) does not fit into any of the provided ranges.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, A4 must be SbF3. This is consistent with the clues: SbF3 is a white solid that can form a colorless solution in a suitable solvent (like HF). The reaction SbF3 + Sb → A5 (\"Sb2F3\") is a plausible comproportionation in a hot solution/melt. The resulting sub-fluoride (A5) would be expected to decompose in water into two substances (e.g., Sb metal and an Sb(III) compound) via disproportionation, which also fits the description.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is approximately 179 g/mol, which falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on the detailed step-by-step reasoning and calculations performed:\n\n1.  **Element Identification**: The element Y was identified as Antimony (Sb) based on the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2. A2 was identified as SbF3.\n2.  **Compound Identification**:\n    *   A4 was identified as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\n    *   A5 was identified as Antimony trifluoride (SbF3).\n3.  **Molecular Weight Calculation**:\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 (SbF5) is approximately 216.76 g/mol.\n    *   The molecular weight of A5 (SbF3) is approximately 178.76 g/mol.\n4.  **Conclusion**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. However, its calculated value (216.76 g/mol) does not fit into any of the given options. The molecular weight of A5 (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly into the range C (160-180). This strongly suggests a typographical error in the question, where it should have asked for the molecular weight of A5 instead of A4. Assuming this likely error, the correct choice is the one corresponding to A5.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YF_n), and the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    Where M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    M(Y) = M(F) * n * (1/ɷF - 1)\n    M(Y) = 19.00 * n * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M(Y) = 19.00 * n * (3.1289 - 1)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now, we test integer values for n (the number of fluorine atoms):\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, Ar, K - none form 5+ fluorides)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, Se - BrF, BrF3, BrF5 known. Kr is 83.8 g/mol)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb, M=121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (closest is Dy, Tb)\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Hg, Tl)\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (closest is Am, Pu)\n\n2.  **Evaluate the best candidates for Y.**\n    *   **Hypothesis 1: Y = Antimony (Sb).** If n=3, M(Y) is ~121.35 g/mol, which is an excellent match for Antimony's molar mass (121.76 g/mol).\n        Let's check the mass percentage for A2 = SbF₃:\n        ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n        This is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making Sb a very strong candidate.\n    *   **Hypothesis 2: Y = Krypton (Kr).** If n=2, M(Y) is ~80.9 g/mol. Krypton's mass is 83.8 g/mol.\n        Let's check the mass percentage for A2 = KrF₂:\n        ɷF(KrF₂) = (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 = 0.3120 or 31.20%.\n        This value is also close to 31.96%, but the match for Sb is significantly better.\n\n3.  **Test the Antimony (Sb) hypothesis against the other clues.**\n    *   Y = Sb, A2 = SbF₃.\n    *   \"A1 decomposes ... into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine.\" This implies A1 is SbF₅ (SbF₅ -> SbF₃ + F₂). However, SbF₅ is very stable and is synthesized from SbF₃ and F₂, it does not decompose this way. This is a major contradiction.\n    *   \"A1 is a bright-red substance.\" SbF₅ is a colorless liquid. This is another major contradiction.\n    *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y\". Sb + F₂ -> SbF₅. So A3 = SbF₅. This is correct.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" SbF₅ is a powerful Lewis acid and oxidizer that reacts with xenon. This is correct.\n    *   \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This means Sb + A4 -> A5 (1:1). If A4 is SbF₅, the known comproportionation reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃, which is not a 1:1 ratio. No other common reaction fits this 1:1 stoichiometry.\n    *   The antimony hypothesis, despite the excellent mass percentage match, leads to multiple strong contradictions.\n\n4.  **Test the Krypton (Kr) hypothesis.**\n    Although the mass % match is not perfect, let's see if the other clues provide a more consistent picture. Such problems can sometimes contain minor numerical errors.\n    *   Y = Kr, A2 = KrF₂.\n    *   \"A1 decomposes ... into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine.\" This means A1 = KrF₄. The reaction KrF₄ -> KrF₂ + F₂ is known to occur as KrF₄ is unstable. This fits.\n    *   \"A1 is a bright-red substance.\" KrF₄ is reported as a white solid. This is a contradiction.\n    *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" KrF₄ would be a very strong oxidizing agent, stronger than KrF₂. Plausible.\n    *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y\". Kr + F₂ -> KrF₂. So A3 = KrF₂. This is correct.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" KrF₂ reacts with xenon (KrF₂ + Xe -> XeF₂ + Kr). This fits.\n    *   \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... A4, A5 can be obtained.\" Let's assume the compounds are not all distinct. If A4=A1=KrF₄, the reaction would be:\n        **Kr + KrF₄ -> 2KrF₂**\n        This reaction is a comproportionation. Crucially, the reactants Kr (Y) and KrF₄ (A4) are in a **1:1 molar ratio**. The product A5 would be KrF₂. This fits the clue perfectly.\n    *   \"Five binary compounds... are known.\" This is a major issue for Krypton, as only KrF₂ is well-established, and KrF₄ is debatable. This seems to be an error in the problem statement.\n    *   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" A5 = KrF₂. Hydrolysis of KrF₂ gives Kr, HF, and O₂ (three substances). This is another contradiction.\n\n5.  **Compare the hypotheses and conclude.**\n    The Antimony (Sb) case has a perfect numerical match but fails on several key chemical reactions and properties. The 1:1 reaction seems impossible to satisfy.\n    The Krypton (Kr) case has a slightly imperfect numerical match and contradicts some descriptive facts (color, number of compounds, hydrolysis products). However, it provides a perfect and elegant explanation for the stoichiometric clues, particularly the 1:1 reaction (Kr + KrF₄). In complex chemistry problems, stoichiometric evidence often outweighs descriptive details which might be simplified or contain errors. The 1:1 reaction is a very strong pointer towards the Krypton hypothesis.\n\n6.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on the more consistent Krypton hypothesis, the compound A4 is KrF₄.\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight.\n    ```python\n    # Molar mass of Krypton (Kr)\n    M_Kr = 83.798  # g/mol\n    # Molar mass of Fluorine (F)\n    M_F = 18.9984 # g/mol\n    # Molecular weight of KrF4\n    M_KrF4 = M_Kr + 4 * M_F\n    print(M_KrF4)\n    ```\n    159.7916\n\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) is approximately 159.8 g/mol.\n    Now, we check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 110-130\n\n    The value 159.8 g/mol falls within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YF_n, where M_Y is the atomic mass of Y, M_F is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * (M_Y + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * M_Y + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 12.9276n\n    M_Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now we can test integer values for n (which represents the oxidation state of Y in A2) to find a plausible atomic mass for Y.\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Ca, K)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br, Se, Kr)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (similar to Sb, Te, I)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (similar to Dy, Tb)\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Pb, Hg)\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidate Elements.**\n    We need to find an element that matches one of these M_Y values and also fits the other chemical descriptions:\n    *   Forms five binary fluorides.\n    *   Has a fluoride (A1) that is a strong oxidizing agent (oxidizes xenon) and decomposes at room temperature (293 K). A1 decomposes to A2 and F2, so A1 has a higher oxidation state than A2.\n\n    Let's test the best candidates from the calculation:\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** For n=2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Kr has M=83.8 g/mol. Let's check if A2=KrF2. The theoretical %F in KrF2 is (2*19)/ (83.8 + 38) = 31.2%. This is reasonably close. However, Kr only forms one well-characterized fluoride (KrF2), not five. This contradicts a key point.\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** For n=3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. The atomic mass of Sb is 121.76 g/mol. This is an excellent match. Let's check the %F in A2 = SbF3.\n        M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n        This value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. This makes Sb the most likely candidate for Y.\n\n3.  **Verify Antimony (Sb) with Other Clues.**\n    Let's assume Y = Sb and A2 = SbF3.\n    *   **A1 decomposes to A2 (SbF3) and F2.** This implies A1 is a higher fluoride, which would be SbF5. The reaction is SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2.\n    *   **A1 oxidizes xenon.** SbF5 is a very strong Lewis acid and fluorinating agent, known to react with and oxidize xenon (e.g., Xe + 2SbF5 → [XeF][Sb2F11]). This fits.\n    *   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y.** Sb + F2 → SbF5. This reaction produces A3, which can also react with xenon. So A3 is also SbF5.\n    *   **Contradictions:** The problem states there are five binary fluorides of Y, but only SbF3 and SbF5 are common. It also states A1 is bright-red and decomposes at 293 K. SbF5 is a colorless liquid that is stable at 293K. These points seem to be flaws in the problem statement, but the numerical match for SbF3 is too strong to ignore.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. Based on our deductions, Y is Sb, and its known fluorides are A2=SbF3 and A1=A3=SbF5. A4 must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony. So, A4 is likely either SbF3 or SbF5.\n\n    Let's analyze the final reaction: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   **If A4 = SbF5:** The reaction is Sb + SbF5 → A5. This is a plausible comproportionation reaction where Sb(0) reduces Sb(V).\n    *   **If A4 = SbF3:** The reaction is Sb + SbF3 → A5. This reaction is not chemically plausible under normal conditions, as you cannot reduce Sb(III) with Sb(0) metal.\n\n    This chemical reasoning suggests A4 should be SbF5. Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n    This value (216.76) does not fall into any of the given ranges. It is close to range C (220-240), but not within it.\n\n    Let's consider the alternative, A4 = SbF3. Its molecular weight is:\n    M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol.\n    This value falls perfectly within range D (160-180).\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    We have a conflict:\n    *   Chemical reasoning points to A4 = SbF5, but its MW doesn't match any option.\n    *   A perfect numerical match exists for A4 = SbF3 with option D, but the associated chemical reaction seems illogical as written.\n\n    In chemistry problems of this nature, a precise numerical fit is often the intended clue, and descriptive parts can sometimes be flawed or simplified. The identification of Y as Sb via the %F in SbF3 is very solid. The fact that the molecular weight of this very same compound, SbF3 (178.76 g/mol), fits perfectly into one of the answer ranges (160-180) is highly unlikely to be a coincidence. Therefore, it is most probable that A4 is intended to be SbF3, despite the problematic description of the final reaction.\n\n    The substance A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol, which is in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the composition of A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFm. The atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (m * 19.00) / (M(Y) + m * 19.00)\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the atomic mass of element Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * m * 19.00 = m * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = m * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = m * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * m\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m\n\n    We need to find an integer 'm' (the number of fluorine atoms) that results in a realistic atomic mass for an element Y that fits the described chemical properties.\n\n2.  **Evaluate chemical properties to constrain Y.**\n    *   **Five binary compounds with fluorine:** This suggests a transition metal, post-transition metal, or a halogen/noble gas with a wide range of oxidation states.\n    *   **A1 is bright-red, decomposes at 293 K (20 °C), and oxidizes xenon:** This points to a highly unstable fluoride of an element in a very high oxidation state. Compounds like PtF6, or fluorides of gold (Au) or certain actinides are known for such properties. A1 decomposing into A2 and F2 (A1 → A2 + F2) implies A1 has a higher fluorine content than A2.\n    *   Let's test potential values for 'm' from the mass calculation:\n        *   m=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.4 g/mol (like Ca, K, Ar): Unlikely chemistry.\n        *   m=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (like Br): Bromine has only 3 common fluorides (BrF, BrF3, BrF5). Doesn't fit.\n        *   m=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (like Sb): SbF5 is the highest fluoride and is not red, nor does it decompose in this manner.\n        *   m=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Lanthanides): Unlikely chemistry.\n        *   m=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol: This is close to Gold (Au, 197.0), Mercury (Hg, 200.6), Thallium (Tl, 204.4), Lead (Pb, 207.2), Bismuth (Bi, 209.0).\n\n3.  **Hypothesize Y = Au (Gold).**\n    Let's check if gold fits the chemical description, even if the mass calculation isn't perfect.\n    *   **Five fluorides:** Yes, AuF, AuF2, AuF3, AuF5, and the (possibly unstable/theoretical) AuF7 are known or have been reported. This fits.\n    *   **A1, A2:** The reaction A1 → A2 + F2 strongly suggests A1=AuF7 and A2=AuF5. AuF7 would be an extremely powerful oxidizer, capable of oxidizing Xenon. High-oxidation state gold compounds can be red. AuF5 is a red solid. This is a very strong fit for the chemical behavior.\n    *   Let's re-check ɷF for A2 = AuF5. M(Au) ≈ 197.0 g/mol. M(AuF5) = 197.0 + 5*19.0 = 292.0 g/mol. ɷF = (5*19)/292 = 95/292 ≈ 32.5%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, and the discrepancy could be due to an error in the problem statement. The chemical evidence for Au is compelling.\n    *   **A3:** A3 is made by fluorinating Au. This could be AuF3 or AuF5. Both are strong Lewis acids and could interact with xenon species (e.g., AuF5 + XeF2 → [XeF][AuF6]). This fits.\n\n4.  **Identify A4 and A5.**\n    With Y=Au, the remaining fluorides for A4 and A5 are AuF, AuF2, and AuF3. Their approximate molecular weights are:\n    *   M(AuF) = 197 + 19 = 216 g/mol\n    *   M(AuF2) = 197 + 38 = 235 g/mol\n    *   M(AuF3) = 197 + 57 = 254 g/mol\n\n    The reaction is: **Y + A4 → A5** (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n    This translates to: **Au + A4 → A5**.\n    The statement \"A5 decomposes in water with the formation of two substances\" is characteristic of disproportionation, which often happens with elements in intermediate oxidation states, like Au(I) or Au(II).\n\n    Let's test the comproportionation reaction: `x Au(0) + y Au(n) → (x+y) Au(m)`.\n    The molar ratio is 1:1, so x=1 and y=1. The reaction is: `Au(0) + AuF_n → 2 AuF_{n/2}`.\n    For the product to be a simple binary fluoride, n/2 must be an integer. This means n must be even.\n\n    *   Let's test `n=2`. A4 = AuF2.\n        *   The reaction becomes: **Au + AuF2 → 2 AuF**.\n        *   The reactants (Au and AuF2) are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This fits the problem description perfectly.\n        *   The product is A5 = AuF.\n        *   Does A5 (AuF) decompose in water? Yes, gold(I) disproportionates: `3AuF → 2Au(s) + AuF3(aq)`. This forms two substances (elemental gold and aqueous gold(III) fluoride). This also fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on our consistent hypothesis, A4 is AuF2.\n    The molecular weight of A4 (AuF2) is M = 197 + 2*19 = 235 g/mol.\n\n6.  **Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Ranges.**\n    We need to find which range contains 235 g/mol.\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 235 falls squarely within the range 220-240.\n\n*(Note: The problem contains some inconsistencies, such as the exact fluorine percentage and the \"colorless\" nature of the A4 solution (Au(II) compounds are typically colored). However, the Gold hypothesis provides the most coherent explanation for the majority of the chemical transformations described, especially the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry and the decomposition of A5.)*\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The primary goal is to determine the chemical identity of substance A4 and calculate its molecular weight to find the correct range among the given options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   There are five binary compounds of element Y and Fluorine (F).\n    *   **A2** is a key substance because we have quantitative data for it: the mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) is 31.96%.\n    *   **A1** is a bright-red substance, decomposes into A2 and F₂, and is a powerful oxidizing agent (oxidizes Xenon).\n    *   **A3** is another fluoride that also oxidizes Xenon and is formed by fluorinating Y.\n    *   **A4** is a fluoride whose hot, colorless, concentrated solution is used in a reaction.\n    *   **A5** is formed by adding element Y to the solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n3.  **Use the Quantitative Data to Identify Element Y:**\n    *   Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where 'n' is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    *   The atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is ~19.00 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\n        ωF = (n × M_F) / (M_Y + n × M_F)\n    *   We are given ωF = 0.3196. Let's solve for M_Y (the atomic mass of element Y):\n        0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M_Y + n × 19.00)\n        0.3196 × (M_Y + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n        0.3196 × M_Y = 19.00n - (0.3196 × 19.00n)\n        0.3196 × M_Y = n × (19.00 - 6.0724)\n        0.3196 × M_Y = 12.9276n\n        M_Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) × n\n        M_Y ≈ 40.45n\n\n4.  **Test Integer Values for 'n' to Find a Plausible Element Y:**\n    *   n = 1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (near Ca, Sc). Unlikely to form 5 fluorides and oxidize Xe.\n    *   n = 2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (near Br, Se). Possible, but the chemistry is less fitting.\n    *   n = 3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Antimony is known to form multiple fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅).\n    *   n = 4: M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (near Dy). Unlikely.\n    *   n = 5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (near Pt, Au). Possible, but the mass fit is not as good as for Sb.\n    *   n = 6: M_Y ≈ 242.70 g/mol (near Pu). Possible, but let's prioritize the best mass fit.\n\n5.  **Develop the Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:**\n    *   Let's assume **Y = Sb**. This means n=3, and substance **A2 = SbF₃**.\n    *   Let's verify the mass percentage for SbF₃: M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3(19.00) = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ωF = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (or 31.88%). This is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and F₂. The reaction must be: SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂. Therefore, **A1 = SbF₅**.\n    *   A3 is formed by fluorinating Y: Sb + F₂ → SbF₅. Therefore, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n    *   This fits the clue that both A1 and A3 can oxidize Xenon, as SbF₅ is a powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent that forms adducts with XeF₂.\n    *   *Note:* While the problem states A1 is \"bright-red\" and decomposes at 293 K, and SbF₅ is actually a colorless liquid that is stable, in chemistry problems of this type, a strong quantitative match often outweighs discrepancies in physical descriptions.\n\n6.  **Identify Substance A4 and Calculate its Molecular Weight:**\n    *   We need to identify A4, which is one of the five fluorides of Antimony. The most common are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   Let's consider both possibilities for A4.\n    *   **Possibility 1: A4 = SbF₅**. The molecular weight is M(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5(19.00) = 216.76 g/mol.\n    *   **Possibility 2: A4 = SbF₃**. The molecular weight is M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3(19.00) = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   The clue about the \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" could refer to either. SbF₅ is a colorless liquid itself. SbF₃ is a solid, but it can be dissolved to form a solution.\n\n7.  **Compare the Calculated Molecular Weights with the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A) 140-160\n    *   B) 110-130\n    *   C) 220-240\n    *   D) 160-180\n    *   The calculated molecular weight for SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) is close to range C but does not fall within it.\n    *   The calculated molecular weight for **SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol)** falls perfectly within range **D) 160-180**.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The quantitative evidence strongly points to Y being Antimony (Sb). The mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is an excellent match for A2. The molecular weight of SbF₃ is 178.76 g/mol, which fits perfectly into the range 160-180. Therefore, A4 is most likely SbF₃.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the detailed step-by-step reasoning and the calculation confirmed by the code execution:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The mass percentage of fluorine (31.96%) in compound A2 (YF_n) leads to the relationship M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n. Testing integer values for n, we find that for n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol, which strongly suggests the element is Dysprosium (Dy, atomic mass 162.50 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A4:** The reaction for forming A5 is a 1:1 molar reaction between Y and A4: `Y + A4 → A5`. This is a comproportionation reaction. With Y=Dy, the reaction `Dy + DyF4 → 2DyF2` fits this 1:1 stoichiometry. This identifies A4 as DyF4.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   Formula of A4: DyF4\n    *   Atomic mass of Dy: 162.50 g/mol\n    *   Atomic mass of F: 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular weight of A4 = 162.50 + 4 × 19.00 = 238.50 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Select the Correct Range:** The calculated molecular weight of 238.50 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.

This is very close to 31.96%.\n*   **For Y=Pu (Plutonium, M≈244 g/mol) and n=6 (PuF₆):**\n    ɷF = (6 * 18.998) / (244 + 6 * 18.998) = 113.988 / 357.988 ≈ 31.84%. This is also very close.\n\n**Step 2: Use other chemical clues to distinguish between candidates.**\n\nLet's evaluate the Antimony (Sb) hypothesis, as it's a more common element in this context than Plutonium.\n*   **Element Y = Sb (Antimony)**\n*   **A2 = SbF₃** (Antimony trifluoride). ɷF = 31.88%, which is a good fit.\n*   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** For Antimony, SbF₃ and SbF₅ are very well known. Mixed-valence compounds like Sb₂F₁₁⁻ (in salts) and polymeric structures exist, and other fluorides have been reported under specific conditions. It is plausible that five compounds are considered \"known\".\n*   **\"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine.\"** The reaction is A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. This means A1 must have a higher fluorine content than SbF₃. The most likely candidate for A1 is **SbF₅** (Antimony pentafluoride). The decomposition would be SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂. This is a known equilibrium, especially at higher temperatures. The problem stating it decomposes at 293K (20°C) implies this equilibrium favors SbF₃ at room temperature, which is reasonable.\n*   **\"A1 (SbF₅) is a bright-red substance.\"** Solid SbF₅ is typically described as colorless, but impurities (like traces of bromine if used in preparation) can give it a yellow or brown color. \"Bright-red\" is a slight discrepancy, but chemical descriptions can vary. However, SbF₅ is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent.\n*   **\"A1 (SbF₅) oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"** SbF₅ reacts with Xenon to form compounds like XeF₂·SbF₅ and XeF₂·2SbF₅. This is a perfect match.\n*   **\"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Sb) with fluorine.\"** Sb + F₂ can produce SbF₃ or SbF₅ depending on conditions. So, A3 could be SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n*   **\"A3 can also interact with xenon.\"** If A3 is SbF₅, this is consistent. If A3 is SbF₃, it does not react with Xenon. So, **A3 is also SbF₅**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and A5.**\n\n*   **\"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** The reaction is Sb + A4 → A5. A4 is a \"colorless concentrated solution\".\n*   This points towards fluoroantimonic acid, H[SbF₆], which is a superacid. It is formed by reacting SbF₅ with HF.\n    HF + SbF₅ → H[SbF₆]\n    So, **A4 is H[SbF₆]**.\n*   The reaction becomes: Sb + H[SbF₆] → A5. This is a reaction in a highly acidic, fluorinating medium. It's likely a redox reaction where Sb⁰ is oxidized. A possible reaction is the formation of a mixed-valence antimony compound.\n*   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"** A plausible product for A5 is the salt of the [Sb₃F₁₄]⁻ anion, with H⁺ as the cation: H[Sb₃F₁₄]. This compound is known to exist.\n    The overall reaction to form A5 would be: 2 Sb + H[SbF₆] + 11 HF → H[Sb₃F₁₄] + 6 H₂ (unlikely) or perhaps involving SbF₅ from the solution. A more plausible reaction involves the SbF₅ used to make the acid:\n    2 Sb + 3 SbF₅ → 5 SbF₃. This is a known comproportionation reaction. If the solution is H[SbF₆], the reaction might be more complex, but the idea of Sb⁰ reducing Sb(V) is sound. A5 could be related to SbF₃ or a complex fluoroantimonate(III). Let's assume A5 is a complex that decomposes in water. For example, fluoroantimonates(III) hydrolyze.\n\nThe identification of **A4 as fluoroantimonic acid, H[SbF₆]**, is the most chemically sound conclusion based on the clues.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\n*   **A4 = H[SbF₆]**\n*   Molar Mass (H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass (Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass (F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n\nM(H[SbF₆]) = 1.008 + 121.76 + 6 * 18.998\nM(H[SbF₆]) = 1.008 + 121.76 + 113.988\nM(H[SbF₆]) = 236.756 g/mol\n\n**Step 5: Match the calculated molecular weight to the given ranges.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 236.756 g/mol. This value falls within the range:\nB) 220-240\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on the detailed reasoning and the output from the code execution, the solution is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The mass percentage of fluorine (31.96%) in compound A2 strongly suggests that A2 is SbF3 (Antimony Trifluoride). The calculated mass percentage of F in SbF3 is approximately 31.88%, which is a very close match. Therefore, element Y is Antimony (Sb).\n\n2.  **Identify Candidate for A4:** The problem describes several binary compounds of Antimony and Fluorine. The most stable and common are SbF3 and SbF5. Therefore, A4 is likely one of these two compounds.\n\n3.  **Calculate Molecular Weight of Candidates:**\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF3 = 121.76 + (3 * 19.00) = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF5 = 121.76 + (5 * 19.00) = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n4.  **Match with Given Ranges:** The question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls.\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls within the range **D) 160-180**.\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n\nThe code execution confirmed this calculation: `Molecular weight of SbF3: 178.754... The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.75) falls into range D: 160-180.`\n\nTherefore, substance A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. Let's assume A2 has the general formula YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, Ar(Y) is the atomic weight of Y, and Ar(F) is the atomic weight of fluorine (approximately 18.998 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for Ar(Y):\n0.3196 = (n * 18.998) / (Ar(Y) + n * 18.998)\nAr(Y) + n * 18.998 = (n * 18.998) / 0.3196\nAr(Y) = (n * 18.998 / 0.3196) - (n * 18.998)\nAr(Y) = n * (59.443 - 18.998)\nAr(Y) ≈ n * 40.445\n\nNow, we test integer values for n to find a corresponding element Y with a close atomic weight.\n\n*   If n = 1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest element is Calcium, Ca, Ar=40.08)\n*   If n = 2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.89 g/mol (Closest is Bromine, Br, Ar=79.90)\n*   If n = 3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.34 g/mol (Closest is Antimony, Sb, Ar=121.76)\n*   If n = 4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.78 g/mol (Closest is Dysprosium, Dy, Ar=162.50)\n*   If n = 5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.23 g/mol (Closest is Mercury, Hg, Ar=200.59)\n*   If n = 6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.67 g/mol (Closest is Plutonium, Pu, Ar=244)\n\nLet's check the properties given in the problem:\n*   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"\n*   \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" This points to Y being an element that forms a very powerful fluorinating agent.\n\nPlutonium (Pu) is a strong candidate. Let's verify the fluorine percentage in PuF₆ (assuming n=6).\nAr(Pu) = 244 g/mol.\nωF in PuF₆ = (6 * 18.998) / (244 + 6 * 18.998) = 113.988 / (244 + 113.988) = 113.988 / 357.988 ≈ 0.3184 or 31.84%. This is very close to the given 31.96%. The small discrepancy can be attributed to using a specific isotope of Plutonium or slight experimental error in the given percentage.\n\nLet's check the other properties for Plutonium:\n*   **Five binary fluorides:** While PuF₃, PuF₄, and PuF₆ are the most common, less stable or intermediate fluorides exist, and the problem statement that \"five are known\" is a plausible premise for a chemistry problem involving plutonium.\n*   **A1 oxidizes Xenon:** A1 decomposes into A2 (PuF₆) and fluorine. This suggests A1 is a higher, unstable fluoride of plutonium. A compound like PuF₈ (though hypothetical or extremely unstable) would be an incredibly strong oxidant, capable of oxidizing xenon. Even PuF₆ itself is a very strong oxidant. The decomposition would be: PuF₈ → PuF₆ + F₂. So, A1 could be PuF₈.\n*   **A3 interacts with Xenon:** A3 is formed by fluorinating Y (Pu). This typically forms the most stable higher fluoride, PuF₆. PuF₆ is known to react with xenon difluoride (XeF₂) to form complexes, so it \"interacts with xenon\".\n\nTherefore, it is highly probable that **Y is Plutonium (Pu)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Compounds A1-A5**\n\n*   **Y**: Plutonium (Pu)\n*   **A2**: PuF₆ (ωF ≈ 31.96%)\n*   **A1**: A higher, unstable fluoride that decomposes to PuF₆ and F₂. Let's assume PuF₈ for the reaction: PuF₈ → PuF₆ + F₂. It is bright-red and oxidizes Xe.\n*   **A3**: The product of fluorinating Pu, which is PuF₆.\n*   **A4 & A5**: The problem states: \"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" The term \"solution\" implies a solvent. For inorganic fluorine chemistry, a common non-aqueous solvent is hydrogen fluoride (HF). The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 ratio suggests a comproportionation reaction where plutonium in different oxidation states reacts. A common reaction in plutonium fluoride chemistry in HF is:\n    Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃\n    This reaction fits the 1:3 stoichiometry. Another possibility involves plutonyl fluoride.\n    However, a simpler reaction fitting the 1:1 stoichiometry is:\n    Pu(VI) + Pu(IV) → 2Pu(V) or Pu(VI) + Pu(0) -> ...\n    A well-known reaction is the preparation of PuF₅:\n    PuF₆ + PuF₄ → 2PuF₅\n    This fits the `A4 + A3 -> 2A5` pattern, but the prompt says `Y + A4 -> A5` (1:1).\n    Let's reconsider the reaction: Pu + A4 -> A5.\n    If A4 is PuF₄, the reaction `Pu + PuF₄` does not proceed in a simple 1:1 manner to a single product.\n    If A4 is PuO₂F₂ (Plutonyl fluoride), which is a colorless solid soluble in HF, the reaction could be:\n    Pu + 3PuO₂F₂ + 8HF → 4PuF₄ + 4H₂O\n    This is not 1:1.\n\n    Let's re-examine the comproportionation `Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃`. Maybe the wording \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a... solution of A4\" does not mean the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1, but that the reactants were mixed in that ratio. This is ambiguous.\n\n    Let's explore another possibility. If Y= Krypton(Kr), A2=KrF₂ (ωF=31.2%). A1 could be KrF₄ which decomposes. However, Kr does not form five fluorides.\n\n    Let's stick with Y=Pu. The set of compounds is likely among the known fluorides PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₅, PuF₆, and the unstable A1 (e.g., PuF₈).\n    A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". PuF₄ is a pinkish-brown solid. PuF₃ is purple. PuF₆ is a reddish-brown solid. None are described as colorless. However, plutonyl fluoride, PuO₂F₂, is a colorless solid and its solutions in HF could be considered colorless. Let's assume A4 is PuO₂F₂.\n    The reaction is Pu + PuO₂F₂ in a 1:1 ratio. This might form PuOF₂ or another mixed-oxidation state species, but the chemistry is complex.\n\n    Let's reconsider the possibility that A4 is one of the binary fluorides, and \"colorless solution\" refers to its solution in HF.\n    - If A4 is PuF₄: PuF₄ is a key intermediate. Its molecular weight is 244 + 4*19 = 320 g/mol.\n    - If A4 is PuF₃: Molecular weight is 244 + 3*19 = 301 g/mol.\n    - If A4 is PuF₅: Molecular weight is 244 + 5*19 = 339 g/mol.\n    - If A4 is PuF₆: Molecular weight is 244 + 6*19 = 358 g/mol.\n\n    None of these molecular weights fall into the provided answer ranges. This suggests a mistake in my identification of Y or A4. Let's revisit the initial calculation.\n\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n * 40.445\n\n    Let's check the elements around the calculated atomic weights again, paying close attention to the properties.\n    - n=3, Ar(Y)≈121.34. Element: Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\n      - ωF in SbF₃ = (3*19)/(121.76 + 3*19) = 57/178.76 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match.\n      - Let's check the properties for Antimony (Y=Sb).\n      - **Five binary fluorides**: This is a known point of contention. SbF₃ and SbF₅ are very well known. Mixed-valence compounds like Sb₂F₁₁ ([SbF₄]⁺[SbF₆]⁻) and polymeric forms exist. It's plausible in a problem context to refer to five species like SbF₃, (SbF₃)n, SbF₅, (SbF₅)n, and Sb₂F₁₁.\n      - **A1 oxidizes Xenon**: Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is an extremely strong Lewis acid and oxidant. It can react with XeF₂. Perhaps a higher fluoride or adduct (A1) exists that decomposes into A2=SbF₃.\n        A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. This would mean A1 is SbF₅. But SbF₅ is stable. The decomposition temperature is 149.5 °C, not 20 °C.\n        This path seems problematic.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` (1:1). It is possible that Y is not an element but a compound. But the problem says \"fluorination of element Y\".\n\nLet's assume our initial identification of Y=Pu was correct and there is an issue with our assumption about A4. What if A4 is not a plutonium compound? The problem says \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A5 is obtained from Y and A4. It decomposes in water. This might suggest A5 is a salt.\nA4 could be a fluoride salt of another element, e.g., CsF, in which Pu compounds are dissolved.\n\nLet's rethink the structure.\n1. A1 -> A2 + F2 (A2 = PuF6) -> A1 = PuF8 (hypothetical) or an adduct.\n2. Y = Pu\n3. A3 = PuF6\n4. Pu + A4 -> A5 (1:1 in HF)\n5. A5 + H2O -> two substances\n\nA common reaction in fluoride chemistry is the formation of complex salts. For example, A4 could be an alkali fluoride like CsF. Plutonium hexafluoride (A3) reacts with CsF:\nPuF₆ + CsF → CsPuF₇\nThis doesn't involve element Y (Pu) as a reactant.\n\nWhat if A4 is XeF₂? It is a colorless solid.\nPu + XeF₂ → PuF₂ + Xe.\nHere A5 is PuF₂, which decomposes in water. MW(XeF₂) = 131.29 + 2*19 = 169.29 g/mol. This falls in range C) 160-180.\nLet's check this hypothesis.\n- A4 = XeF₂ (MW = 169.3 g/mol)\n- A5 = PuF₂ (formed from Pu + XeF₂)\n- A5 decomposes in water: PuF₂ + 2H₂O → Pu(OH)₂ + 2HF. This forms two substances.\n- This seems very plausible. A4 is a colorless solid, it can be used to make a solution. The reaction with an active metal like Pu makes sense. Xenon is involved elsewhere in the problem (oxidized by A1/A3), making its presence as a compound plausible.\n\nTherefore, the most logical candidate for A4 is Xenon Difluoride (XeF₂).\nMolecular Weight of XeF₂ = Ar(Xe) + 2 * Ar(F) = 131.29 + 2 * 18.998 = 131.29 + 37.996 = **169.29 g/mol**.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal check of all points with Y=Pu and A4=XeF₂:\n- Five binary fluorides of Y=Pu: Plausible for a problem statement.\n- A1 (e.g. PuF₈) decomposes at 293K to A2 (PuF₆, ωF≈31.9%) and F₂. Plausible.\n- A1 oxidizes Xe. A very high fluoride like PuF₈ would.\n- A3 (PuF₆) interacts with Xe. True, it reacts with XeF₂.\n- A4 is XeF₂. Its solution can be made.\n- Pu + XeF₂ (1:1) → PuF₂ + Xe. A5 = PuF₂. This works.\n- PuF₂ decomposes in water. True.\n\nThe logic holds together. The molecular weight of A4 (XeF₂) is ~169.3 g/mol.\n\nThe given ranges are:\nA) 110-130\nB) 220-240\nC) 160-180\nD) 140-160\n\nOur calculated value of 169.3 g/mol falls squarely in range C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula is YF_n.\n    The formula for mass fraction is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    Using the molar mass of F ≈ 19.00 g/mol:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    M(Y) = (n * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n * 19.00)\n    M(Y) = 59.45n - 19.00n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer n (the number of fluorine atoms) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, Ar)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br, Se)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Sb, Antimony, M=121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element)\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Hg, Au)\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (very close to Pu-242, Am-243)\n\n    Let's check the most promising candidates by calculating the theoretical mass fraction:\n    *   For Y=Sb (Antimony) and n=3, A2 = SbF3.\n        M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 0.3188 (31.88%). This is very close to 31.96%.\n    *   For Y=Pu (Plutonium, isotope 242) and n=6, A2 = PuF6.\n        M(PuF6) = 242.06 + 6 * 19.00 = 356.06 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (6 * 19.00) / 356.06 = 0.3201 (32.01%). Also very close.\n\n    Both Sb and Pu are strong candidates for element Y.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues for A1 and A3.**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and F2. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of Y (YF_m -> YF_n + F2, where m > n).\n    *   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. Then A1 must be SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid and decomposes at much higher temperatures (>400 °C). This is a major contradiction.\n    *   If Y=Pu, A2=PuF6. Then A1 must be a higher fluoride like PuF8. Such a compound is not known to be stable, but for a problem, its existence might be assumed. Being extremely unstable, decomposition at 293 K would be plausible. Its color is unknown, so \"bright-red\" cannot be immediately refuted. PuF6 itself is reddish-brown.\n    *   Both SbF5 and PuF6 are extremely strong oxidizing agents and would react with Xenon, fitting the description for A1 and A3.\n\n    There are inconsistencies in both scenarios, which is common in complex chemistry problems. However, we have enough information to proceed by analyzing the second part of the problem concerning A4.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    The key information is:\n    *   A5 is obtained by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4.\n    *   The reaction is: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 falls into one of the given ranges.\n\n    The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` where Y is a metallic or metalloid element suggests a redox reaction where A4 is an oxidizing agent. Since the problem's context is fluorine chemistry, A4 is likely a fluoride. A4 must also form a colorless solution.\n\n    Let's consider the xenon fluorides as potential candidates for A4, as they are strong fluorinating oxidizers and are colorless.\n    *   **XeF2**: Molar mass = 131.29 + 2 * 19.00 = 169.29 g/mol.\n    *   **XeF4**: Molar mass = 131.29 + 4 * 19.00 = 207.29 g/mol.\n    *   **XeF6**: Molar mass = 131.29 + 6 * 19.00 = 245.29 g/mol.\n\n    Now, let's compare these molecular weights with the given ranges:\n    *   A) 220-240\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 160-180\n\n    Only XeF2 (169.3 g/mol) fits perfectly into one of the ranges: **D) 160-180**. XeF4 and XeF6 do not fit into any of the ranges. This provides very strong evidence that **A4 is XeF2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Rest of the Clues with A4 = XeF2.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Let's see if the reaction `Y + XeF2 -> A5` (1:1) is chemically sound.\n        A plausible reaction is `Y + XeF2 -> YF2 + Xe`. This is a 1:1 reaction between Y and A4. Substance A5 would be YF2.\n    *   **A5 Decomposition:** The problem states A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n        *   If Y=Sb, A5=SbF2. Antimony(II) fluoride would hydrolyze in water, for example: `SbF2 + H2O -> SbO + 2HF`. This produces two substances. This is consistent.\n        *   If Y=Pu, A5=PuF2. Plutonium(II) fluoride would also hydrolyze. This is also consistent.\n    *   **Conclusion on A4:** The identification of A4 as XeF2 is consistent with the reaction chemistry regardless of whether Y is Sb or Pu, and it is the only plausible candidate whose molecular weight fits the given options.\n\n5.  **Final Answer.**\n    The substance A4 is identified as Xenon difluoride (XeF2). Its molecular weight is approximately 169.3 g/mol. This value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    We are given that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote it YF_n) and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    where M_F is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M_Y is the atomic mass of element Y.\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging for M_Y, we get:\n    M_Y = 19.00 * n * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n    We need to find an integer 'n' (the oxidation state of Y in A2) that results in a realistic atomic mass M_Y for an element that can form five binary fluorides and whose compounds can oxidize xenon.\n\n2.  **Test Potential Elements.**\n    *   If n=6, M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 6 = 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic masses of transuranic elements like Plutonium (Pu, ~244 g/mol) or Americium (Am, 243 g/mol). Let's check Pu. If Y=Pu and n=6, A2 would be PuF6. The theoretical mass % of F in PuF6 is (6*19)/(244+6*19) = 114/358 = 31.84%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%. However, calculating the molecular weights of plutonium fluorides (PuF3: 301, PuF4: 320, PuF5: 339, PuF6: 358 g/mol) shows that none of them fall into the low molecular weight ranges given in the options (A, B, C, D). This rules out Plutonium and other heavy elements.\n    *   If n=3, M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol). Let's check the mass % of F in SbF3. M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol. %F = (3*19)/178.76 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match. Let's keep Sb as a candidate.\n    *   Let's test another candidate from the same region of the periodic table, Iodine (I, M=126.9 g/mol). If Y=I, what would n be? n ≈ M_Y / 40.45 = 126.9 / 40.45 ≈ 3.13. This is very close to n=3. So A2 could be IF3. Let's check the mass % of F in IF3. M(IF3) = 126.9 + 3*19 = 183.9 g/mol. %F = (3*19)/183.9 = 30.99%. This is reasonably close to 31.96% (about 3% relative difference).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Candidates Y=Sb and Y=I using other clues.**\n    The crucial clue is the reaction to form A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    This is a comproportionation reaction where elemental Y reduces A4.\n    *   **If Y=Sb:** A4 must have a higher oxidation state than A5. The main fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5. So, A4 must be SbF5 and A5 must be SbF3. The reaction is Sb + SbF5 → SbF3. The balanced reaction is **2** Sb + **3** SbF5 → 5 SbF3. The molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, not 1:1. This contradicts the problem statement. So, Y is not Sb.\n    *   **If Y=I:** The standard state of iodine is I2. \"Adding Y\" refers to adding I2. The known fluorides are IF, IF3, IF5, IF7. Let's test the reaction I2 + A4 → A5. The reaction **I2 + IF3 → 3 IF** is a known comproportionation reaction where the molar ratio of reactants (I2:IF3) is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    This implies **A4 = IF3** and **A5 = IF**.\n\n4.  **Verify the remaining clues for Y=I.**\n    *   **A4 = IF3**: \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". IF3 is a yellow solid, which contradicts \"colorless\". This is a noted inconsistency.\n    *   **A5 = IF**: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" IF is known to disproportionate in water: 5 IF + 3 H2O → 2 I2 + HIO3 + 5 HF. This produces two iodine-containing substances (I2 and HIO3). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Let's reconsider the \"colorless\" clue. It's possible the clue is flawed, or refers to something else. Let's check other possibilities for A4. What if A4 = IF5? IF5 is a colorless liquid, which fits the description. The reaction would be I2 + IF5 -> A5 (1:1), where A5 would be a mixed-valence species I3F5. This is plausible. So A4 could be IF5.\n\n5.  **Determine A4 by its Molecular Weight.**\n    We have two main candidates for A4: IF3 and IF5. Let's calculate their molecular weights and check the given options.\n    *   M(IF3) = 126.9 + 3 * 19.0 = 183.9 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the ranges (it's close to range B: 160-180, but outside it).\n    *   M(IF5) = 126.9 + 5 * 19.0 = 221.9 g/mol. This value falls perfectly into range **C) 220-240**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The hypothesis that Y=I and A4=IF5 is the most consistent one. It fits the molecular weight range perfectly, and IF5 is a colorless liquid, matching the description of the solution of A4. While there are inconsistencies in the problem description (the color of A1, the slight inaccuracy of the mass % for A2=IF3), the identification of A4=IF5 is strongly supported by its molecular weight and physical properties.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (IF5) is ~222 g/mol. This falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and compound A2 using the given mass percentage.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) being 31.96%.\nThe formula for A2 can be written as YF_n.\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\nWhere M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * n = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = (19.00 - 6.0724) * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow, we test small integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible molar mass M(Y) that corresponds to a known element.\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (This is close to Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (This is close to Bromine, but its fluorides don't match the problem description well).\n*   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol).\n*   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No common element matches).\n*   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Close to Mercury or Thallium, but their fluoride chemistry is not extensive enough).\n*   If n = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (This is very close to Plutonium, Pu, with an atomic mass around 244 g/mol).\n\nLet's verify the two best candidates, Sb and Pu.\n*   For Y=Sb, A2 = SbF3. M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (31.88%). This is very close to the given 31.96%.\n*   For Y=Pu, A2 = PuF6. M(PuF6) = 244 + 6 * 19.00 = 358 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (6 * 19.00) / 358 = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%). This is also very close.\n\nHowever, many of the qualitative descriptions in the problem (e.g., \"colorless concentrated solution of A4\") fit the chemistry of antimony (whose fluorides are colorless) better than that of plutonium (whose compounds are characteristically colored). Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF5, is also a known agent that can oxidize xenon. While there are inconsistencies in the problem statement for any choice, the numerical evidence for Sb is slightly stronger, and the qualitative clues also point towards it. So, we will proceed with the hypothesis that **Y = Sb**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the possible compounds A4.**\nIf Y is Antimony (Sb), its common binary fluorides are Antimony(III) fluoride (SbF3) and Antimony(V) fluoride (SbF5). Therefore, substance A4 must be one of these two compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weights of the possible compounds for A4.**\n*   Molecular Weight of SbF3: M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n*   Molecular Weight of SbF5: M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the calculated molecular weights with the given options.**\nThe question asks to indicate the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls.\nThe options are:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nLet's check our calculated values:\n*   The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls within the range **160-180 g/mol**.\n*   The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges. It is close to range B, but it is not within it.\n\nBased on this, A4 must be SbF3. The molecular weight of A4 falls in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n*(Note: The problem contains several statements that are contradictory or factually incorrect, regardless of the choice of element Y. However, by focusing on the quantitative data provided—the mass percentage and the final options for molecular weight—we can arrive at the most plausible intended answer.)*\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the mass percentage of A2.**\n    Let the chemical formula of A2 be YFₓ, where Y is the unknown element and x is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is given as 31.96% or 0.3196.\n    The formula for the mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (x * Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + x * Molar Mass of F)\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\n    Let's rearrange the formula to solve for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19x) = 19x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724x = 19x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19x - 6.0724x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276x\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    Now we test integer values for x (which represents the oxidation state of Y) to find a plausible element.\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Calcium, Argon). Calcium fluoride is CaF₂, not CaF. No noble gas fluoride fits.\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, Selenium). Bromine fluorides are known, but the properties don't match well.\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Antimony, Sb). SbF₃ has ɷF = (3\\*19)/(121.76+57) ≈ 31.88%. This is a close match.\n    *   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Dysprosium, Dy). DyF₄ has ɷF = (4\\*19)/(162.5+76) ≈ 31.86%. This is also a very close match.\n    *   If x = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Bismuth, Bi). BiF₅ has ɷF = (5\\*19)/(208.98+95) ≈ 31.25%. This is not a good match.\n\n    We have two strong candidates: Antimony (Sb) and Dysprosium (Dy).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates using the other chemical properties.**\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: Y = Antimony (Sb)**\n        A2 would be SbF₃. The problem states that A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine (A1 -> SbF₃ + F₂). This means A1 would have a higher oxidation state, likely SbF₅. However, A1 is described as bright-red, while SbF₅ is a colorless liquid. This is a contradiction. Therefore, Y is unlikely to be Antimony.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: Y = Dysprosium (Dy)**\n        A2 would be DyF₄. This is a known, though unstable, fluoride of dysprosium.\n        *   **A1:** Decomposes to A2 (DyF₄) and F₂. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride, like a hypothetical DyF₅ or DyF₆. A bright-red, highly unstable, powerfully oxidizing compound is plausible for a high-oxidation state lanthanide fluoride. It oxidizing xenon fits this picture.\n        *   **A3:** Obtained by fluorinating Dy, also interacts with xenon. DyF₄ fits this description as it is a strong oxidizer.\n        *   **A4 & A5:** The key reaction is `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio. For Y=Dy, this is `Dy + A4 -> A5`. This stoichiometry strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction, where an element in different oxidation states reacts to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state. The known oxidation states of Dysprosium are +2, +3, and +4.\n        The reaction `Dy(0) + Dy(IV)F₄ -> 2 Dy(II)F₂` perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio of reactants (Y and A4) and produces a single substance (A5).\n        Thus, it is highly probable that **A4 = DyF₄** and **A5 = DyF₂**.\n        *   **A5 Check:** The problem states that A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. DyF₂ contains Dy(II), which is a powerful reducing agent. It would react with water, for example: `2 DyF₂ + 2 H₂O -> 2 DyF₃ + H₂`. This produces two substances (Dysprosium(III) fluoride and hydrogen gas), which is consistent with the problem description.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, substance A4 is Dysprosium tetrafluoride (DyF₄).\n    *   Molar Mass of Dysprosium (Dy) ≈ 162.5 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (DyF₄) = M(Dy) + 4 * M(F) = 162.5 + 4 * 19.0 = 162.5 + 76.0 = 238.5 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 238.5 g/mol. We now check which of the given ranges this value falls into:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The value 238.5 g/mol is within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, n is the number of fluorine atoms, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (approx. 19.00 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWe are given ɷF = 31.96% = 0.3196. We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\nM(Y) = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\nWe need to find an element Y and an integer n that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for n:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (fits Ca, K, Sc - these do not typically form five binary fluorides or fit the other chemical properties).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (fits Br, Se - Bromine has 3 common fluorides, Selenium has 3).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits).\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (somewhat close to Bi, Hg).\n*   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (fits Plutonium, Pu=244 g/mol).\n\nLet's check the most promising candidates, Sb and Pu, with a more precise calculation.\n\n**Candidate 1: Antimony (Sb)**\nIf Y = Sb and n = 3, then A2 = SbF3.\nM(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\nɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 18.998 / 178.754) * 100% = 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n\n**Candidate 2: Plutonium (Pu)**\nIf Y = Pu and n = 6, then A2 = PuF6.\nM(PuF6) = 244 + 6 * 18.998 = 357.988 g/mol.\nɷF(PuF6) = (6 * 18.998 / 357.988) * 100% = 31.84%. This is also very close.\n\nHowever, when we check the molecular weights of possible compounds against the given answer ranges, plutonium fluorides (PuF3 ≈ 301, PuF4 ≈ 320, PuF6 ≈ 358) do not fit at all. This strongly suggests Y = Antimony (Sb).\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct the scenario with Y = Antimony (Sb).**\n\n*   **Y = Sb**. The problem states five binary compounds are known. The two major ones are SbF3 and SbF5. Other, less stable or polymeric species may be considered to reach five for the context of this problem.\n*   **A2 = SbF3**. This is based on the excellent match of the fluorine mass percentage.\n*   **A1**: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine\". This implies the reaction A1 -> SbF3 + F2. For this to happen, A1 must be a higher fluoride than SbF3, which would be SbF5. So, **A1 = SbF5**. There is a known contradiction here: SbF5 is a colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid, and it's thermally stable. We must assume these properties are either incorrect or refer to an obscure, reactive form within the problem's context.\n*   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\". The fluorination of Sb can yield SbF3 or SbF5. The ability to interact with xenon (a hallmark of very strong Lewis acids or oxidizing agents) points definitively to **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. A4 must be one of the antimony fluorides, likely SbF3 or SbF5, as they are the main ones. Both are colorless.\n\n**Step 3: Determine A4 by calculating molecular weights and comparing with the given ranges.**\n\nWe need to find the molecular weight of A4. The most plausible candidates for A4 are SbF3 and SbF5. Let's calculate their molecular weights.\n*   **Molar Mass of SbF3**: M = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   **Molar Mass of SbF5**: M = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nNow, let's compare these values with the given answer ranges:\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\n*   The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range **A) 160-180**.\n*   The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well in any range. It is close to range D, but outside of it.\n\nThis provides strong evidence that **A4 is SbF3**.\n\nThe final parts of the problem describe the formation of A5 (Sb + SbF3 -> A5) and its subsequent decomposition in water. This describes a comproportionation reaction to form a subfluoride (A5), which would then disproportionate upon hydrolysis. This is chemically complex but does not contradict the identification of A4 based on its molecular weight.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n    We are given that compound A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF = 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × n × 19.00 = n × 19.00\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = n × 19.00 × (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = n × 19.00 × 0.6804\n    M(Y) ≈ n × (12.9276 / 0.3196)\n    M(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\n    We now test integer values for n, which corresponds to the oxidation state of element Y.\n    *   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Bromine, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't align).\n    *   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol. This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No suitable element).\n    *   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Close to Hg or Tl, but less likely based on subsequent clues).\n\n    Let's verify our choice. If Y = Sb and n = 3, then A2 is SbF₃.\n    Let's calculate the precise mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ (using M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol and M(F) = 18.998 g/mol):\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n    ɷF = (3 × 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compounds A1 and A3**\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 must be a fluoride of antimony with a higher oxidation state. The most stable and common higher fluoride is Antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅. So, **A1 = SbF₅**.\n    *   The problem states A1 oxidizes xenon. SbF₅ is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, known to react with xenon. This further supports A1 = SbF₅.\n    *   A3 is obtained by direct fluorination of element Y (Sb) and it also reacts with xenon. Fluorination of antimony can yield SbF₃ or SbF₅. Since A3 reacts with xenon, it must be the strong oxidizer, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5**\n    *   A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. Let's consider the hydrolysis of SbF₃ (our compound A2).\n        SbF₃ + H₂O → SbOF↓ + 2HF(aq)\n        This reaction produces two distinct substances: antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). This perfectly matches the description. Thus, it is highly likely that **A5 = SbF₃**.\n    *   Now, let's look at the formation of A5. It is obtained by adding element Y (Sb) to a solution of A4.\n        Reaction: Sb + A4 → A5 (which is SbF₃)\n        The reaction is: Sb⁰ + A4 → Sb⁺³F₃.\n    *   This is a comproportionation reaction. Antimony in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) is oxidized to +3. For this to happen, A4 must contain antimony in a higher oxidation state that gets reduced to +3. The only common higher fluoride is SbF₅. Therefore, **A4 = SbF₅**.\n    *   The chemical reaction is: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. While the problem states a 1:1 molar ratio, this is likely an error in the problem statement, as is common in complex descriptive problems. The chemical transformation itself is the crucial clue.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n    We have confidently identified A4 as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). Now we calculate its molecular weight.\n    M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n    M(F) = 18.998 g/mol\n    Molecular Weight of A4 (SbF₅) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F) = 121.76 + 5 × 18.998 = 121.76 + 94.99 = **216.75 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range**\n    We need to find the range in which the molecular weight of 216.75 g/mol falls.\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The calculated value of 216.75 g/mol does not fit exactly into any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to range C. The difference between our calculated value and the lower bound of range C is only 220 - 216.75 = 3.25. This small discrepancy suggests that C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the composition of substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YFz) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    Let My be the molar mass of element Y and Mf be the molar mass of fluorine (19.00 g/mol).\n    The formula for the mass percentage is: ɷF = (z * Mf) / (My + z * Mf)\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    0.3196 = (z * 19.00) / (My + z * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * My + 0.3196 * 19.00 * z = 19.00 * z\n    0.3196 * My + 6.0724 * z = 19.00 * z\n    0.3196 * My = 12.9276 * z\n    My = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * z\n    My ≈ 40.45 * z\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer z (the number of fluorine atoms) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for z:\n    *   z=1: My ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This corresponds to Argon or Calcium, which are not known to form the described range of fluorides.\n    *   z=2: My ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (79.9 g/mol) or Selenium (79.0 g/mol). Bromine is a halogen itself, and its fluorides don't match the description. Selenium forms SeF4 and SeF6, not five compounds.\n    *   z=3: My ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol. This is a very strong candidate. Let's assume **Y=Sb** and **A2=SbF3**.\n    *   z=4: My ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is close to Terbium (158.9 g/mol) or Dysprosium (162.5 g/mol).\n    *   z=5: My ≈ 202.25 g/mol. This is near Gold (197.0), Mercury (200.6), or Bismuth (209.0).\n    *   z=6: My ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This matches the isotope Plutonium-242. However, solutions of plutonium compounds are known to be colored, which contradicts a later clue (\"colorless concentrated solution of A4\").\n\n2.  **Verify the mass percentage for A2=SbF3.**\n    MW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188, or 31.88%.\n    This value (31.88%) is very close to the given value of 31.96%, confirming that Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 is a highly probable identification.\n\n3.  **Identify the other compounds based on Y=Sb.**\n    The known binary fluorides of antimony are SbF3 and SbF5. The problem states five compounds are known, which is a discrepancy. However, given the strong numerical match for Sb, we'll proceed by assuming the problem may be flawed in this descriptive detail or counts polymeric forms.\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2(SbF3) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride, so **A1=SbF5**. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" does not match the known properties of SbF5 (colorless, stable liquid/solid). This is another likely flaw in the problem statement.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y(Sb) and reacts with Xenon. This can be SbF5. SbF5 is a powerful Lewis acid and reacts with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF2 + SbF5 → [XeF]+[SbF6]−). So, **A3=SbF5**.\n\n4.  **Identify substance A4.**\n    The problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   A4 is a fluoride of Antimony, so it is either SbF3 or SbF5.\n    *   Both SbF3 and SbF5 can form colorless solutions (e.g., in anhydrous HF).\n    *   The question is to find the molecular weight range of A4. Let's calculate the MW for both possibilities and check against the options.\n        *   **MW(SbF3)** = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n        *   **MW(SbF5)** = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Check the molecular weights against the given ranges.**\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 220-240\n    *   D) 160-180\n\n    *   The MW of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely in range **D) 160-180**.\n    *   The MW of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit any of the ranges.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the strong numerical evidence, Y is Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF3. The only fluoride of antimony whose molecular weight fits one of the given ranges is SbF3. Therefore, **A4 must be SbF3**.\n    The reaction described (Sb + SbF3 → A5) is chemically problematic, as is the description of A1. However, given the multiple-choice format, the numerical coherence between the mass percentage of A2 and the molecular weight of A4 provides the only logical path to a unique answer among the options.\n\n    The molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is 178.76 g/mol, which lies in the range 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe step-by-step reasoning has been completed, and the calculations were verified by the python script.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y**: Based on the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF=31.96%) in compound A2 (YFₙ), we set up the equation M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n. Testing integer values for n, n=3 gives M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol, which is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, M ≈ 121.76 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Identify A2**: With Y=Sb and n=3, compound A2 is Antimony trifluoride, SbF₃. The code output confirms the mass fraction of fluorine in SbF₃ is ~31.88%, which is very close to the given value of 31.96%.\n\n3.  **Identify A1 and A3**: A1 decomposes to A2 (SbF₃) and F₂, implying it's a higher fluoride. A1 also oxidizes Xenon. Both properties point to A1 being Antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅. Since A3 is also formed by fluorinating Sb and reacts with Xenon, A3 is also SbF₅.\n\n4.  **Identify A4**: A4 is a binary fluoride of Antimony, so the main candidates are SbF₃ and SbF₅. We need to find its molecular weight range.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF₃ = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF₅ = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match with Options**: We compare these molecular weights with the given ranges:\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 160-180\n\nThe molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls within the range 160-180. The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.75 g/mol) does not fit any range. Therefore, A4 must be SbF₃.\n\nThe question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls. Since A4 is SbF₃ with a molecular weight of approximately 178.8 g/mol, it falls into the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the information about compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YFₓ) with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). We can set up an equation to find the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) in terms of x, the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic mass of fluorine (M(F)) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\nSolving for M(Y):\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00x) = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724x = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276x\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nWe need to find an integer `x` for which `40.45 * x` corresponds to the molar mass of a known element.\n\n*   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest is Calcium, Ca=40.08)\n*   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (Closest is Bromine, Br=79.90)\n*   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Closest is Antimony, Sb=121.76)\n*   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (Closest is Dysprosium, Dy=162.50)\n*   If x = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Closest is Bismuth, Bi=208.98 or Mercury, Hg=200.59)\n*   If x = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.70 g/mol (Closest is Plutonium, Pu=244 or Americium, Am=243)\n\n**Step 2: Use other clues to identify Element Y and its fluorides.**\n\nWe have several other important pieces of information:\n1.  **Five binary compounds** of Y and F are known.\n2.  **A1 is bright-red**, decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and F₂, and oxidizes xenon (Xe) under normal conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidates for Y from Step 1:\n*   **Bromine (Br)**: Forms BrF, BrF₃, BrF₅ (3 compounds, not 5). Rule out.\n*   **Antimony (Sb)**: Forms SbF₃, SbF₅ (2 compounds, not 5). Rule out.\n*   **Plutonium (Pu)**: A good candidate from the mass calculation (M(Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol for x=6). PuF₆ is a strong oxidizing agent (can oxidize Xe) and is reddish-brown (\"bright-red\" is plausible). It decomposes to PuF₄ and F₂. However, only three binary fluorides of Pu are well-known (PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₆), not five.\n*   Let's check the element that is most famous for having five binary fluorides: **Uranium (U)**. The known binary fluorides are UF₃, UF₄, U₂F₉ (or UF₄.₅), UF₅, and UF₆. This fits the \"five compounds\" clue perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Verify if Y = Uranium fits the scenario.**\n\n*   **A2 = UF₆**: Let's check the mass fraction of F in UF₆. M(U) ≈ 238 g/mol.\n    ɷF(UF₆) = (6 * 19) / (238 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 352 = 0.3238 or 32.38%.\n    This is very close to the given 31.96%. The small discrepancy (~1.3% relative error) is common in such problems due to rounding of atomic masses. So, we can confidently identify **A2 as UF₆**.\n\n*   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (UF₆) and F₂. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride than UF₆. No stable binary uranium fluoride above UF₆ is known. However, the problem describes A1 as highly unstable (\"decomposes at 293 K\"). Also, A1 is \"bright-red\" and oxidizes Xe under \"normal conditions\". This description perfectly matches **Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**.\n    *   KrF₂ is one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known and readily oxidizes Xe.\n    *   It decomposes slowly at room temperature (293 K).\n    *   Some reports describe solid KrF₂ as having a reddish appearance at low temperatures.\n    The reaction is a complex fluorination, not a simple decomposition:\n    U + 3 KrF₂ → UF₆ + 3 Kr\n    Although A1 (KrF₂) is not a compound of Y, it is the reagent used to produce A2 (UF₆). The wording \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine\" might be a slightly simplified or misleading description of a complex reaction where KrF₂ acts as a fluorine source to create UF₆. Given the other constraints, this is the most logical interpretation.\n\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Y with fluorine, and it can interact with Xenon.\n    Y + F₂ → A3. A3 interacts with Xe.\n    U + 3F₂ → UF₆. As established, UF₆ (A2) can react with Xe, so A3 could be UF₆. This aligns.\n\n**Step 4: Identify A4 and A5.**\n\n*   We are given the reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** (in a 1:1 molar ratio, in a hot concentrated solution).\n*   In our case: **U + A4 → A5**\n*   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n\nLet's consider the possible identities of A4 and A5 from the known chemistry of uranium fluorides. A common reaction in aqueous uranium chemistry involves the disproportionation of U(V) compounds or comproportionation reactions.\nA key reaction involves the uranyl ion, (UO₂)²⁺. Let's consider A4 to be an aqueous acid of the uranyl ion. The most common is Uranyl fluoride, UO₂F₂ dissolved in hydrofluoric acid (HF). Uranyl fluoride itself is a colorless substance in solution.\nSo, let's assume **A4 is UO₂F₂**.\n\nThe reaction is:\nU + UO₂F₂ (+ other reagents, likely HF) → A5\n\nA known comproportionation reaction is:\nU(s) + UO₂²⁺(aq) + 4H⁺(aq) → 2U⁴⁺(aq) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nIf we use hydrofluoric acid, the product U⁴⁺ will precipitate as UF₄ (uranium tetrafluoride).\nLet's check the stoichiometry:\nU + UO₂F₂ + 4HF → 2UF₄ + 2H₂O\nThis is a balanced reaction. Here, Y (U) and A4 (UO₂F₂) react in a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction.\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe solution likely contains more than just A4. Let's assume A4 is a uranium compound where uranium is in a +6 oxidation state, like UF₆ or UO₂F₂. The element Y is uranium in oxidation state 0. They react to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state. A5 decomposes in water. This is characteristic of U(V) compounds.\n\nA plausible reaction involves forming a U(V) complex:\nU(0) + UF₆ (in HF solution) → Formation of U(V) species.\nHowever, a more direct comproportionation is:\nU(0) + 3UF₆ → 4UF₄(V) -> this is incorrect.\nU(IV) + U(VI) -> 2U(V). Example: UF₄ + UF₆ -> 2UF₅\nThis doesn't involve element Y (Uranium metal).\n\nLet's go back to the aqueous chemistry involving uranyl ions.\nPerhaps A4 is nitric acid, HNO₃, a colorless concentrated solution. Uranyl nitrate UO₂(NO₃)₂ is formed, which is colorless to pale yellow. This doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's stick with the most plausible candidate for an aqueous uranium(VI) solution: **UO₂F₂ in HF**. The stoichiometry might be complex. The key information is that **A4 is a colorless solution containing a uranium(VI) compound**. UO₂F₂ is the most logical choice.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n\nWe have identified A4 as Uranyl Fluoride, UO₂F₂.\nLet's calculate its molecular weight:\nM(U) ≈ 238.03 g/mol\nM(O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\nM(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight (MW) of UO₂F₂ = M(U) + 2 * M(O) + 2 * M(F)\nMW = 238.03 + 2 * 16.00 + 2 * 19.00\nMW = 238.03 + 32.00 + 38.00\nMW = **308.03 g/mol**\n\nThis falls into none of the given ranges. Let me re-check my deductions. Everything points strongly to Uranium. The A4 identification seems the most likely weak point.\n\nLet's revisit the core, confirmed facts: Y=U, A2=UF₆.\nWhat else could A4 be? \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". Y is added to it.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nU + A4 -> A5\n\nMaybe A4 is a non-uranium compound? This is unlikely, given the context. The problem revolves around the compounds of Y.\nLet's rethink the reaction.\nA5 decomposes in water into two substances.\nWhat if A4 is a U(IV) compound, and it gets reduced? Unlikely.\nWhat if the reaction is not aqueous? \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This could mean a non-aqueous solvent.\nFor example, UF₆ can be dissolved in anhydrous HF. This solution is colorless.\nReaction: U + UF₆ (in HF) -> A5.\nThis reaction does not proceed in a simple 1:1 stoichiometry to a single product.\n\nThere might be an error in my reasoning or the problem statement has a twist. Let's reconsider all fluorides of uranium as A4.\n- UF₃: black/purple solid.\n- UF₄: green solid.\n- U₂F₉: black solid.\n- UF₅: blue/gray solid.\n- UF₆: colorless solid, sublimes. A solution in HF is colorless.\n- UO₂F₂: colorless in solution.\nIf \"solution of A4\" implies that A4 is the solute, both UF₆ and UO₂F₂ are candidates.\nMW(UF₆) = 352.03 g/mol.\nMW(UO₂F₂) = 308.03 g/mol.\nNeither fit the ranges perfectly.\n\nLet's re-examine the given answer ranges:\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nCould Y be a different element? The \"five fluorides\" points overwhelmingly to Uranium. The mass calculation for A2 fits UF₆ well. The properties of A1 are tricky but can be reconciled. It's highly probable that Y=Uranium.\n\nLet's think of another compound for A4. What if the description \"colorless concentrated solution\" is key. A solution of Uranium(IV) fluoride, UF₄, in certain complexing agents can be colorless. But UF₄ itself is a green solid.\n\nThere must be a compound of Uranium whose mass is in one of those ranges.\nLet's check Uranium oxides, chlorides, etc.\n- UO₃: 238 + 3*16 = 286\n- UO₂: 238 + 2*16 = 270\n- UCl₄: 238 + 4*35.5 = 238 + 142 = 380\n- UCl₆: 238 + 6*35.5 = 238 + 213 = 451\n\nThere is another possibility. The \"Y\" in the final reaction \"Y+A4->A5\" might not be the element Uranium, but one of its compounds, like UF₄. This contradicts the problem stating \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio...\".\n\nLet's reconsider the mass of Y. What if the given ɷF=31.96% for A2=YFₓ is exact?\nFrom M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x:\n- x=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8\n- x=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3\n- x=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 (closest is Pu)\n\nLet's try Y = Neptunium (Np, M=237). Np is between U and Pu.\nɷF(NpF₆) = (6*19)/(237+114) = 114/351 = 32.47%. Still very close to ɷF(UF₆).\nNp also has multiple fluorides (NpF₃, NpF₄, NpF₆). Not five.\n\nThe evidence for Y=Uranium remains the strongest. Let's assume A4 is a simple, common compound that has been missed.\nLet's look for a Uranium compound with MW in the range 220-240.\nThis would have to be U + (something with negative mass) or a very light adduct. This is impossible.\n\nLet's rethink \"binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\". What if Y is not a metal? What if Y=Iodine?\nIodine (I, M=126.9). Forms IF, IF₃, IF₅, IF₇. Four compounds, close to five.\nLet's check mass fractions. A2=IFₓ, ɷF=31.96%\nM(I)=126.9. M(Y)= (x*19/0.3196) - 19x = 40.45x\n126.9 = 40.45x -> x=3.13. Close to x=3.\nLet's check ɷF(IF₃) = (3*19)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 = 31.0%. Close to 31.96%.\nSo, maybe Y=Iodine and A2=IF₃.\nA1 decomposes to A2(IF₃) + F₂ -> A1=IF₅.\nLet's check properties of IF₅: Colorless liquid. Doesn't fit \"bright-red\".\nSo Y is not Iodine.\n\nThe entire logical chain leads back to Uranium. There must be an interpretation of A4 that gives a MW in one of the ranges.\nLet's try one more time. Is there any other Uranium compound? What about Uranium(IV) borohydride U(BH₄)₄? MW = 238 + 4*(10.8+4) = 238 + 59.2 = 297.2. No.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: U(metal) + A4 -> A5.\nMaybe A4 is an oxoacid?\nH₂SO₄? HNO₃? HClO₄? These are all colorless.\nU + HNO₃ -> UO₂(NO₃)₂. A4 would be HNO₃, MW=63. Not in range.\nU + HClO₄ -> .... complex. MW(HClO₄) = 100.5.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and A4 is **Uranium trioxide, UO₃**.\nMW = 238 + 3*16 = 286. Still not in range.\nHow about **Uranium(IV) oxide, UO₂**? MW = 238 + 32 = 270.\nMaybe the question meant \"atomic weight of Y\"? M(U)=238, which is in the range 220-240. But it asks for MW of A4.\n\nLet's assume the question and ranges are correct and my identification of Y is wrong, despite the strong evidence.\nLet A4's MW be `M`.\n- A) M ∈ [140, 160].\n- B) M ∈ [110, 130].\n- C) M ∈ [220, 240].\n- D) M ∈ [160, 180].\n\nLet's try Y=Tellurium (Te, M=127.6). It forms TeF₄, TeF₆, and Te₂F₁₀. Not five.\nCheck ɷF for TeF₄: (4*19)/(127.6+76) = 76/203.6 = 37.3%.\nCheck ɷF for TeF₆: (6*19)/(127.6+114) = 114/241.6 = 47.2%. Not a match.\n\nThe weight of evidence for Y=U is too strong to ignore. Let's reconsider the molecular weight calculation.\nMaybe A4 is UOCl₂? MW = 238 + 16 + 2*35.5 = 254+71 = 325. No.\nUranium(IV) chloride, UCl₄? MW = 380. No.\nUF₄? MW = 238 + 4*19 = 314. No.\nWhat if Y is Pu? M=244. PuF₄ MW=320.\nPuO₂ MW = 244 + 32 = 276.\n\nLet's take a leap of faith based on the strong evidence for Y=Uranium. M(U) ≈ 238 g/mol. The question asks for the molecular weight of A4. If A4 is somehow element Y itself, then its atomic weight is 238, which lies in the range 220-240. But A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\", which cannot be a solid metal. However, sometimes in abstract problems, terms are used loosely. For example, if A4 was meant to be the elementary substance Y, U-238, its molar mass fits range C.\nLet's see if this interpretation makes any sense.\nY + Y -> A5? This is nonsensical.\n\nLet's go back to the most likely candidate: UF₄. Maybe my calculation is wrong. M(U) is 238.0289. M(F) is 18.9984. UF₄ = 238.0289 + 4*18.9984 = 314.02. This is not in any range.\n\nLet's review the prompt. This appears to be a problem from a chemistry olympiad or a similar high-level competition. These problems are usually self-consistent. The convergence on Y=Uranium is very strong. Let's trust this and see if A4 can be found. The reaction U + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio) is the only piece of information about A4. A known reaction is UF₄ + UF₆ -> 2UF₅. This is a 1:1 reaction. Could Y be UF₄ and A4 be UF₆? This redefines Y mid-problem. That's not right.\n\nThere is a possibility that Y is not a single element but represents a group, but the term \"element Y\" contradicts this.\n\nLet's assume Y = Pu. Then A2 could be PuF₆. ɷF = (6*19)/(244+114) = 114/358 = 31.84%. This is an excellent match for 31.96%.\nSo, **Y = Plutonium (Pu)**.\nA1 decomposes to A2 (PuF₆) and F₂. Again, this suggests A1 is a higher fluoride, which isn't known. Or A1=PuF₆ and it decomposes to PuF₄+F₂. This would make A2=PuF₄. ɷF(PuF₄) = (4*19)/(244+76) = 76/320 = 23.75%. This is not 31.96%.\nSo, A2 must be PuF₆. This means A1 decomposes to PuF₆ + F₂. The only way this works is if it's not a simple decomposition, similar to the KrF₂ + U -> UF₆ + Kr scenario.\n\nLet's proceed with Y=Pu, A2=PuF₆.\n- Five binary compounds of Pu and F? No, only three are known. This is a major contradiction.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, the Uranium hypothesis with the five fluorides seems more robust, even with the small mass fraction discrepancy for UF₆. The most likely source of error is either in the description of the reaction for A4 or A4 itself is an unusual compound. Let's reconsider the molecular weight of Uranium itself: 238 g/mol. It falls in range C. If A4 is a placeholder name for the Y substance used as a reagent, this might be the intended answer, however strange the phrasing.\nIf A4 = UF₆, MW = 352.\nIf A4 = UO₂F₂, MW = 308.\nIf A4 = UF₄, MW = 314.\nIf A4 = UF₅, MW = 333.\nNone of these fit the provided options.\n\nThere must be another compound. What about uranium peroxide, UO₄·2H₂O? This compound is pale yellow. MW = 238 + 4*16 + 2*18 = 302 + 36 = 338.\nThere is no clear path to a compound that fits one of the molecular weight ranges. Let's reconsider the mass calculation. Perhaps x=4? M(Y) = 161.8. No element fits well.\n\nLet's assume the question implies Y is Iodine, since it is a well-known element forming many interhalogen compounds.\nY=I, A2=IF₃. A1=IF₅.\nI + A4 -> A5 (1:1). A5 decomposes in water. A4 is colorless.\nA possible reaction: I₂ + 5F₂ -> 2IF₅.\nA3 is obtained by fluorination: I₂ + F₂ -> 2IF. A3=IF. It can interact with Xe to form complexes.\nSo far, plausible except for the color of A1(IF₅) being colorless, not red.\nWhat could A4 be? Let's check iodine compounds.\nHI: MW=128 (in range B). HIO₃: MW=176 (in range D). HIO₄: MW=192 (not in range).\nReaction: I + HIO₃ -> ? In a 1:1 molar ratio, this could be the comproportionation reaction: 5I⁻ + IO₃⁻ + 6H⁺ -> 3I₂ + 3H₂O. Not Y + A4.\nMaybe I₂ + I₂O₅ -> I₂O₃+I₂O₂ ?\n\nThis path is not yielding a clear result and has contradictions. The Uranium path is the most coherent despite the issues with A4's identity. The atomic mass of Uranium (238 g/mol) falls in range C (220-240). Given the high probability that Y is Uranium and the ambiguity/potential error in the description of A4 and its reaction, it is a strong possibility that the question is indirectly asking for a property of Y itself. If A4 is a simple compound of Y, its mass would be M(Y) + other atoms, so M(A4) > M(Y) = 238. Thus A4 should be >238. None of the ranges A, B, D work. Range C is the only one that is even close to the scale of M(Y). If we assume A4 = UO₂ (Uranium dioxide), its mass is 270 g/mol, outside of C.\n\nLet's go with the Pu=Y hypothesis again, as the mass calculation is a better fit. Y=Pu, A2=PuF₆. We must ignore the \"five fluorides\" rule. A1 oxidizes Xe, reddish -> PuF₆. Okay. A3 fluorination product that interacts with Xe -> PuF₆. A5 from Pu + A4. A4 is a colorless solution. PuF₄ is pinkish. Plutonyl solutions (PuO₂²⁺) are pink-orange. Only Pu³⁺ is blue/violet. It's hard to find a colorless solution for A4. But if we ignore that, maybe A4=PuO₂? MW=276. Out of range. Maybe A4 = PuCl₃? MW = 244 + 3*35.5 = 349.5. No.\n\nThe most plausible scenario remains Y=U. The discrepancy in F% is small. The five fluorides rule is unique. The difficulty is in A4. If we are forced to choose an answer, and knowing Y=U, the only mass range that is \"in the ballpark\" for a heavy element like Uranium is C. If we hypothesize that A4 is an obscure or misdescribed compound, whose mass happens to fall in that range, this is a possible path. There is no simple, common uranium compound that fits the mass range. But the identity of Y=Uranium is the most solid conclusion from the premises. Based on this, it's a process of elimination on the MW ranges. A compound of U will be heavy. A, B, and D are too light. A compound of U could plausibly be in range C, for example, if it were something like UF₂ (hypothetical), MW=238+38=276, still outside. Or UO (hypothetical), MW=238+16=254. Again outside. The range C contains the atomic mass of Y itself. This might be a hint.\n\nLet's choose C, based on the high likelihood that Y is Uranium, and range C is the only plausible range for the mass of a heavy element compound (or the element itself).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that compound A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YF_n) and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    Let M_Y be the molar mass of element Y and M_F be the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * 19.00 * n = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = (19.00 - 6.0724) * n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 12.9276 * n\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We need to find an integer `n` that results in a realistic atomic mass M_Y for an element Y that can form multiple fluorides.\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but its fluorides don't match the %F).\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, but its chemistry doesn't fit, as we'll see).\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (several heavy elements are nearby, but the fit is less precise).\n    *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Plutonium, but its fluoride chemistry creates contradictions with the problem statement).\n\n    Let's verify the %F for A2 = SbF3.\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    %F = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 * 100% = 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a difference of only 0.08%.\n    So, we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** (Antimony) and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A3.**\n    A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Sb) with fluorine. It can also interact with xenon.\n    The reaction Sb + F2 (excess) -> SbF5. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is a very powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent. It is known to react with xenon or xenon fluorides to form complex salts like [XeF]+[SbF6]−.\n    Thus, **A3 = SbF5**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the remaining compounds and reactions.**\n    We have five compounds: A1, A2(SbF3), A3(SbF5), A4, A5.\n    The properties of A1 (bright-red, decomposes to SbF3 and F2 at room temperature) are problematic as SbF5 is colorless and stable. However, this information might be a distractor or refer to an obscure compound not needed to find A4. Let's proceed by focusing on the reaction involving A4.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound A4.**\n    The key information is: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n    Let's substitute what we know:\n    *   Y = Sb\n    *   Reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n    *   A4 is a binary fluoride of Antimony.\n    *   A5 disproportionates in water (this is implied by forming two substances from a single one, suggesting a compound with an unstable oxidation state).\n\n    We must identify A4. Let's consider the possible binary fluorides of antimony for A4 from the given options for its molecular weight.\n    *   A4 could be SbF3. Molar mass of SbF3 is ~178.76 g/mol. This falls perfectly within the range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   A4 could be SbF5. Molar mass of SbF5 is ~216.75 g/mol. This value is close to, but outside, the range A) 220-240.\n\n    Let's test the chemical plausibility of A4 being SbF3.\n    *   If A4 = SbF3, the reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(III)F3 -> A5 (1:1).\n    *   This is a reaction between an element in its 0 oxidation state and its +3 oxidation state. This could plausibly form a sub-valent or mixed-valence compound. Given the 1:1 stoichiometry, A5 would have the formula Sb2F3.\n    *   A compound like Sb2F3 would have an average oxidation state of +1.5 for Sb. Such compounds are expected to be unstable in water and disproportionate. For example:\n        `Sb2F3 + H2O -> Sb(s) + Sb(OH)3 + HF`\n        This reaction produces Antimony metal (Sb) and an Antimony(III) compound, which are \"two substances\". This fits the description perfectly.\n\n    Now, let's test the plausibility of A4 being SbF5.\n    *   If A4 = SbF5, the reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(V)F5 -> A5.\n    *   This is a classic comproportionation reaction. The known reaction is `Sb + 2SbF5 -> 3SbF3`. This is a 1:2 molar ratio, not the 1:1 ratio stated in the problem. This contradicts the problem's conditions.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The only option that is chemically consistent with all the reaction details (1:1 ratio, decomposition of A5) is that A4 is SbF3. The molecular weight of SbF3 is approximately 178.76 g/mol.\n\n    This value falls in the range **160-180**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nFive binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y are known. The key properties described, particularly for substance A1 (\"bright-red\", \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\"), strongly suggest that A1 is platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆), and therefore element Y is Platinum (Pt). Neil Bartlett's famous experiment in 1962 demonstrated that PtF₆, a deep-red solid, can oxidize xenon.\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis with the other clues:\n1.  **Element Y = Platinum (Pt)**. Platinum is known to form several binary fluorides, including PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆, so the existence of five compounds is plausible.\n\n2.  **Substance A1 = PtF₆**. It is a red solid and a powerful oxidizing agent capable of reacting with xenon. It is thermally unstable and decomposes upon heating. This perfectly matches the description of A1.\n\n3.  **Decomposition of A1**. \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2... and fluorine.\" The reaction is PtF₆ → A2 + F₂. A2 must be a lower fluoride of platinum, such as PtF₅ or PtF₄. The given mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (31.96%) does not perfectly match PtF₅ (32.7%) or PtF₄ (28.0%), suggesting a possible error in the problem's data. However, the qualitative chemical properties are a stronger guide. Let's assume A2 is PtF₅.\n\n4.  **Reaction to form A5**. \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   Y = Pt\n    *   The reaction is: Pt + A4 → A5 (with a 1:1 molar ratio between Pt and A4).\n    *   This describes a comproportionation reaction, where Pt in oxidation state 0 reacts with a platinum fluoride (A4, with Pt in a positive oxidation state) to form a platinum fluoride with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n    *   Let's test possible identities for A4, which must be a platinum fluoride. The reaction `Pt(0) + Pt(II)F₂ → 2Pt(I)F` or `Pt(0) + Pt(IV)F₄ → 2Pt(II)F₂` both have a 1:1 molar ratio between the reactants (Pt and the platinum fluoride A4).\n\n5.  **Calculate Molecular Weight of A4**. We need to find which candidate for A4 has a molecular weight that fits one of the given ranges.\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = PtF₄**. The reaction is `Pt + PtF₄ → 2PtF₂`. Here A5 is PtF₂.\n        Molar Mass (PtF₄) = M(Pt) + 4 * M(F) = 195.08 + 4 * 19.00 = 271.08 g/mol. This value does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = PtF₂**. The reaction is `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`. Here A5 is PtF.\n        Molar Mass (PtF₂) = M(Pt) + 2 * M(F) = 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = 233.08 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\nThis confirms that A4 is likely PtF₂. The other clues are consistent with this assignment: A5 would be PtF, which is a known but unstable compound that would readily decompose in water as stated.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) is 233.08 g/mol, which is in the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that for compound A2, the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\nThe formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\nwhere M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to find a relationship between M(Y) and the stoichiometric coefficient n:\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * n = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = (19.00 - 6.0724) * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\nM(Y) / n = 12.9276 / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45\n\nThis means the ratio of the atomic mass of element Y to the number of fluorine atoms in compound A2 is approximately 40.45.\n\nLet's test some plausible integer values for n against known elements:\n*   n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca or Ar, unlikely candidates).\n*   n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br).\n*   n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.3 g/mol (close to Sb).\n*   n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Tb or Dy).\n*   n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.2 g/mol (close to Hg, Tl, or Bi).\n*   n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Pu or Am).\n\nThe problem states that \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" This is a very strong clue. We can search for elements known to form this many fluorides. Uranium (U) is a prime candidate, forming UF3, UF4, U2F9, UF5, and UF6. Let's check if Uranium fits the mass ratio.\n*   For Y=U (M=238.03 g/mol), the ratio M(Y)/n would require n = 238.03 / 40.45 ≈ 5.88. This is very close to 6.\nSo, we can hypothesize that **Y is Uranium (U)** and **A2 is Uranium Hexafluoride (UF6)**.\n\nLet's verify the other clues with Y=Uranium:\n*   **\"A1 is a bright-red substance\"**: The known uranium fluorides are not bright red (UF4 is green, UF5 is pale blue/gray, UF6 is colorless). This is a discrepancy. However, the rest of the clues might point strongly to Uranium, suggesting this might be an error in the problem description or a reference to an unusual state.\n*   **\"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (UF6) and fluorine\"**: This would mean `A1 -> UF6 + F2`. A1 would have to be a fluoride with a higher oxidation state than +6 (e.g., UF7), which is not a known stable compound. This is another major issue with the Uranium hypothesis based on this specific reaction.\n\nHowever, let's reconsider the mass calculation for another very close candidate. Plutonium (Pu, M ≈ 244 g/mol).\n*   For Y=Pu, n = 244 / 40.45 ≈ 6.03. This is an even better fit for n=6. Thus A2 could be PuF6. Let's calculate the theoretical ɷF for PuF6: M(PuF6) = 244 + 6*19 = 358 g/mol. ɷF = (114/358)*100% = 31.84%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n\nNow, let's check clues for Plutonium (Pu):\n*   **Five binary compounds**: Only PuF3, PuF4, and PuF6 are well-established. This contradicts the clue.\n*   **A1 color**: PuF6 is reddish-brown, which is much closer to \"bright-red\" than any uranium fluoride.\n*   **A1 decomposition**: The problem states `A1 -> A2 + F2`. If we assume A1=PuF6 (it is known to be unstable), it decomposes via `PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2`. This would make A2 = PuF4. The mass percentage of F in PuF4 is 23.75%, which does not match 31.96%.\n*   The conflict between the number of compounds and the chemical properties is significant. Given that the number of compounds is a very specific piece of data, and the mass percent calculation for UF6 is reasonably close, we will proceed with the **Y=Uranium** hypothesis, acknowledging the inconsistencies, which might be intentional misdirection or errors in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Compounds A1, A3, A4, A5**\n\nLet's assume Y = Uranium. The five compounds are UF3, UF4, U2F9, UF5, UF6.\n*   **A2 = UF6** (from Step 1).\n*   **A1**: Decomposes to A2 (UF6) + F2. As discussed, this is chemically problematic. For the sake of the puzzle, we move on. \"A1 oxidizes xenon\". Higher fluorides are strong oxidizers.\n*   **A3**: \"Can also interact with xenon\" and \"is obtained by fluorination of element Y\". Direct fluorination of Uranium metal can produce UF4, UF5, or UF6 depending on conditions. All are strong fluorinating agents.\n*   **A5**: Obtained via `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a comproportionation reaction: `U + UF_n -> 2UF_{n/2}`. For A5 to be one of the known binary fluorides (UFx), `n` must be an even integer and `x = n/2`.\n    *   If A4 = UF6 (n=6), then the reaction is `U + UF6 -> A5`. The product would be UF3.5 on average (`U2F7`), which isn't one of the five listed compounds. However, the reaction `U + 2UF6 -> 3UF4` is known but is not 1:1.\n    *   If **A4 = UF4** (n=4), the reaction is `U + UF4 -> A5`. This is a known reaction: `U + 3UF4 -> 4UF3` at high temperature, again not 1:1. However, if we interpret the 1:1 ratio as producing a compound with the average oxidation state, `U(0) + U(IV)F4 -> \"U(II)F2\"`. `UF2` is not a standard stable fluoride of Uranium.\n    *   Let's reconsider the products. If **A4 = UF6**, what if A5 is UF4? The balanced reaction is `U + 2UF6 -> 3UF4`. This is not 1:1. What if A5 is UF5? The reaction is `U + 4UF6 -> 5UF5`, also not 1:1.\n    *   Let's assume there is a simple reaction pathway not immediately obvious. The phrase \"in a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" is key. UF6 solutions (e.g., in HF) are generally colorless to pale yellow, and it is a powerful reagent. UF4 is a green solid and not readily soluble to form a concentrated solution. Therefore, **A4 is most likely UF6**.\n*   **A4 = UF6** (Uranium Hexafluoride).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on our deduction that A4 is UF6:\n*   Atomic mass of Uranium (U) ≈ 238.03 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular weight of UF6 = M(U) + 6 * M(F)\n*   Molecular weight of UF6 ≈ 238.03 + 6 * 19.00 = 238.03 + 114 = **352.03 g/mol**\n\nThis value, 352.03 g/mol, does not fall into any of the provided ranges (A, B, C, D). This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or a flawed premise. Let's revisit the prompt critically.\n\nPerhaps element Y is not Uranium. Let's re-examine the clue:\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe key might be \"colorless solution\".\nWhich element Y has fluorides that form colorless solutions, and one of them (A4) can react with Y?\nLet's consider **Y = Xenon (Xe)**.\nKnown binary fluorides: XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. (This contradicts the \"five compounds\" rule).\nProperties:\n*   All are colorless solids.\n*   They can be dissolved in anhydrous HF to form colorless solutions.\n*   The reaction `Xe + XeF4 -> 2XeF2` occurs at 400°C. This is a 1:1 molar reaction (`Y + A4 -> A5`).\nThis fits the clue perfectly. Let's assume A4=XeF4 and A5=XeF2.\nNow we must check if this fits the rest of the puzzle.\n*   **A2**: ɷF = 31.96%. M(Xe)/n = 131.29 / n ≈ 40.45 -> n ≈ 3.25. This doesn't fit neatly with XeF2, XeF4, or XeF6. This is a major contradiction.\n\n**Conclusion Re-evaluation**\n\nThere are contradictions in the problem statement, which is common in complex chemistry puzzles. The \"five binary compounds\" points very strongly to Uranium. The mass percentage calculation points to A2 being UF6 (or PuF6). The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` is difficult to reconcile with Uranium chemistry in a simple 1:1 ratio. The color of A1 (bright-red) and the colorless solution of A4 are also contradictory for Uranium fluorides (UF4 is green, UF6 is colorless solid but its solutions are not always colorless, and higher fluorides are reactive).\n\nLet's assume the question has an error and the answer lies with the most likely candidate despite contradictions. The Xenon hypothesis fails on the mass percentage. The Plutonium hypothesis fails on the number of compounds and the decomposition reaction's products. The Platinum hypothesis fails on the number of compounds and the colorless solution.\n\nThe Uranium hypothesis, despite its flaws, is the only one that satisfies the \"five binary compounds\" rule and has a plausible mass percentage fit. The most likely candidate for A4 (a substance that can be in solution and react with its parent element) within the uranium fluoride family would be the highest fluoride, UF6, used as a powerful reagent. Let's recalculate the molecular weight of UF6 and see if it's close to any range, perhaps using different isotopic masses. No, the standard atomic weight should be used. 352.03 g/mol is the value.\n\nThere seems to be a significant error in the problem statement or the provided options, as 352 g/mol is far from any of them. Let's rethink the `Y+A4 -> A5` reaction. What if it happens in a specific solvent where a complex is formed? For example, in BrF3, U metal reacts with the solvent.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem from a completely different angle. Maybe the element is **Tellurium (Te)**.\nFluorides: TeF4, Te2F10, TeF6. TeF6 is very stable. TeF4 can form a complex [TeF3]+. Not five compounds. Let's check mass ratio: M(Te)/n = 127.6/n = 40.45 -> n=3.15. No.\n\nGiven the irreconcilable contradictions, there must be a non-obvious interpretation or a faulty premise in the question. However, in such puzzles, one often has to choose the 'least wrong' path. The Uranium path, while having issues with color and reaction stoichiometry, is anchored by the \"five compounds\" clue. If we must identify A4, it would be one of the five Uranium fluorides. UF4 (MW = 314) and UF6 (MW = 352) are the most common. UF6 being a strong oxidizing agent used in solutions makes it a slightly better candidate for A4. Since 352 is far from the options, maybe A4 is not UF6. What if A4 is UF4? MW=314 g/mol. Still not in range. What about UF5? MW=333 g/mol. U2F9? MW=587 g/mol. UF3? MW=295 g/mol. None fit.\n\nThis suggests the element Y is incorrect. Let's go back to the python script output, which suggested an excellent candidate: Krypton.\n*   Y = Krypton (Kr). M = 83.8 g/mol.\n*   M/n = 83.8 / 2 = 41.9. This is close to 40.45.\n*   Let's check the mass percent in KrF2. M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 38 = 121.8 g/mol. ɷF = 38/121.8 = 31.2%. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\nLet's analyze Krypton based on the clues.\n1.  **Five compounds?** No, only KrF2 is well-established. KrF4 is debated. Contradiction.\n2.  **A1**: Red substance. No krypton fluoride is red. They are colorless. Contradiction.\n3.  **A1 decomp to A2+F2**: Maybe KrF4 (A1) -> KrF2 (A2) + F2.\n4.  **A1/A3 oxidizes Xe**: KrF2 is a very strong oxidizer, stronger than XeF2. It can oxidize xenon.\n5.  **A3 from Y+F2**: Kr + F2 -> KrF2. So A3 could be KrF2.\n6.  **Y+A4 -> A5**: Xe + A4 -> A5. Does not make sense with Y=Kr.\n\nThere is no element that cleanly fits all clues. The question is likely flawed. However, if forced to choose based on the given answer choices, let's work backward.\nAssume the answer is B) 220-240. What compound A4 has a MW in this range?\nIt must be a fluoride YF_n.\nIf n=4, M(YF4)=M(Y)+76 is in [220, 240]. M(Y) is in [144, 164]. Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy fit. DyF4 exists.\nIf n=5, M(YF5)=M(Y)+95 is in [220, 240]. M(Y) is in [125, 145]. Te, I, Xe, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd fit. PrF5, NdF5 are not standard.\nIf n=6, M(YF6)=M(Y)+114 is in [220, 240]. M(Y) is in [106, 126]. Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te, I. Only TeF6 is common.\nLet's check A4=TeF6. M(TeF6)=127.6+114=241.6 g/mol. This is in range B.\nLet's see if Y=Te works. Five compounds? No. M/n for A2 = 127.6/n = 40.45 -> n=3.15, not an integer.\n\nGiven the profound inconsistencies, a direct logical path to the answer is impossible. The question is flawed. There is no other recourse.\n\nFinal Attempt with a \"trick\": The description of the formation of A5 involves `Y + A4 -> A5`. This suggests a comproportionation. A parallel might be `I- + I2 -> I3-`. If Y=Iodine, Fluorides are IF, IF3, IF5, IF7. Four compounds, close to five. A4 could be IF5 (MW=221.9), which falls in range B. Let's check Y=Iodine.\n*   A2 = IFn. M(I)/n = 126.9/n = 40.45 -> n=3.13. So A2 is IF3.\n*   ɷF in IF3 = (3*19)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 = 30.99%. This is very close to 31.96%!\n*   So, Y=I, A2=IF3.\n*   A1 decomposes to A2(IF3)+F2. `A1 -> IF3 + F2`. So A1 must be a higher fluoride, like IF5 or IF7. Reaction: `IF5 -> IF3 + F2`. This happens at high temp. `IF7 -> IF5 + F2` is also known. A1 must be one of these. Neither is \"bright-red\".\n*   A3 from I2 + F2 -> A3. Can be IF5 or IF7.\n*   A4 is needed. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". IF5 is a colorless liquid at RT. IF7 is a colorless gas. So A4 is likely IF5.\n*   Let's check the molecular weight of A4=IF5. M(IF5) = 126.9 + 5*19 = 126.9 + 95 = **221.9 g/mol**.\n*   This molecular weight falls squarely in the range **B) 220-240**.\nThis fits almost all clues much better than any other element, with the main exception being the \"five compounds\" (Iodine has four) and the color of A1. This is the most consistent solution.\n\nFinal check of reaction: `Y + A4 -> A5`. `I2 + IF5 -> ?` (1:1 molar ratio of I to IF5). `I2` is two I atoms. This is `2I + IF5`. Unclear stoichiometry. However, it's possible the \"Y\" in the equation refers to an I atom, not I2 molecule.\n\nDespite minor flaws, the Iodine hypothesis is overwhelmingly the most coherent.\n\n**A4 = IF5, MW = 221.9 g/mol.**\n\nThis falls in the range **220-240**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n    Let the element be Y and its molar mass be M(Y). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\n    The mass fraction of fluorine (ωF) is given as 31.96% or 0.3196.\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (n * 19.00) = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (19.00 * 0.6804) / 0.3196\n    M(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\n    We can now test integer values of n to find a plausible element Y.\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, 40.08 g/mol). Calcium chemistry does not fit the problem's description (e.g., oxidizing xenon).\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, 79.9 g/mol, or Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb, 121.76 g/mol).\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (closest is Dy, 162.5 g/mol). Dysprosium chemistry does not fit.\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Hg, 200.6 g/mol, or Tl, 204.4 g/mol). Neither fits the reactive fluoride chemistry.\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (closest is Pu, 244 g/mol, or Am, 243 g/mol). Plutonium forms PuF6 and is a strong oxidizing agent.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates for Element Y.**\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu, n=6):** If Y=Pu, then A2 = PuF6.\n        Let's check the mass percentage: M(PuF6) = 244 + 6*19 = 358 g/mol. ωF = (6*19)/358 = 114/358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%). This is very close to the given 31.96%.\n        The problem states A1 oxidizes xenon, which PuF6 does. So, this is a strong candidate. However, we will see that none of Pu's fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6) have a molecular weight that falls into any of the given answer ranges. This rules out Plutonium.\n        *   MW(PuF3) ≈ 301 g/mol\n        *   MW(PuF4) ≈ 320 g/mol\n        *   MW(PuF6) ≈ 358 g/mol\n    *   **Antimony (Sb, n=3):** If Y=Sb, then A2 = SbF3.\n        Let's check the mass percentage: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol. ωF = (3*19)/178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (31.88%). This fit is also very good. Antimony forms SbF3 and SbF5. SbF5 is a strong oxidizer. A1 would be SbF5, but SbF5 is colorless, not \"bright-red\". A4 could be SbF3 (MW ≈ 179) or SbF5 (MW ≈ 217). SbF3's MW falls in range C. However, the reaction Sb + SbF3 -> A5 (1:1) has no plausible product, as there are no stable antimony fluorides with an oxidation state between 0 and +3. This rules out Antimony.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr, n=2):** If Y=Kr, then A2 = KrF2.\n        Let's check the mass percentage: M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8 g/mol. ωF = (2*19)/121.8 ≈ 0.312 (31.2%). This fit is less accurate but still plausible for a contest problem. Let's examine the chemical properties.\n\n3.  **Construct the chemical scenario with Y = Krypton.**\n    *   **Element Y:** Krypton (Kr).\n    *   **Compounds:** Known binary fluorides are mainly KrF2 and KrF4. The problem's \"five compounds\" is likely an exaggeration or includes unstable/ionic species, a common feature in such puzzles.\n    *   **A1:** \"decomposes... into A2 and fluorine\". If A2 is KrF2, then A1 must be KrF4. The reaction is KrF4 → KrF2 + F2. KrF4 does decompose when warmed. The \"bright-red\" description is a known inconsistency in this problem; KrF4 is a colorless solid. We assume it's a flaw in the problem statement.\n    *   **A2:** KrF2.\n    *   **A3:** \"obtained by fluorination of element Y... interacts with xenon\". The reaction Kr + F2 gives KrF2. KrF2 reacts with Xe. So, A3 = KrF2.\n    *   **The key reaction:** \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes a comproportionation reaction. If we take A4 = KrF4, the reaction is:\n        Kr + KrF4 → 2 KrF2\n        This reaction has a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants (Kr and KrF4) and produces A5 = KrF2. This provides a very logical and elegant solution to this part of the puzzle.\n    *   **A4:** KrF4.\n    *   **A5:** KrF2.\n    *   **Decomposition of A5 in water:** \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" The reaction of KrF2 with water gives Kr, O2, and HF (three substances). This is another factual inconsistency in the problem statement, but it doesn't prevent the identification of A4.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n    Based on our deduction, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF4).\n    *   Molar mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.8 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of A4 (KrF4) = M(Kr) + 4 * M(F) = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0 = 83.8 + 76 = 159.8 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 159.8 g/mol. We check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160 (159.8 is in this range)\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 110-130\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 falls into the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula for a binary fluoride is YFₓ.\n\nThe mass percentage of fluorine can be expressed as:\nɷF = (x * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + x * Ar(F))\n\nLet Ar(F) be approximately 19.00 g/mol and Ar(Y) be the atomic weight of element Y.\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (Ar(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for Ar(Y):\n0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * x = 19.00 * x\n0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 19.00 * x - 6.0724 * x\n0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 12.9276 * x\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nWe can test integer values for x (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible atomic weight for element Y.\n*   If x = 1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 (close to Ca, Ar, K - unlikely candidates)\n*   If x = 2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 (close to Br, Se - Bromine only forms 3 stable fluorides)\n*   If x = 3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 (close to Sb, but it only forms 2 fluorides)\n*   If x = 4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 (close to Dy, Tb)\n*   If x = 5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 (close to Hg, Tl)\n*   If x = 6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 (close to Am)\n*   If x = 7, Ar(Y) ≈ 283.15\n\nLet's use a more precise atomic mass for Fluorine (18.998 g/mol) and check against a table of elements for a better match. The element must also satisfy other conditions: forming five binary fluorides and having strongly oxidizing higher fluorides.\n\nA known element that fits these criteria remarkably well is Rhenium (Re).\nLet's test this hypothesis.\nIf Y = Rhenium (Re), its atomic weight Ar(Re) is 186.21 g/mol.\nLet's see which fluoride of Rhenium gives a fluorine mass percentage close to 31.96%.\n186.21 ≈ 40.45 * x  => x ≈ 186.21 / 40.45 ≈ 4.6. This is very close to x=5.\n\nLet's assume A2 is ReF₅.\n*   Formula: ReF₅\n*   Molar Mass: 186.21 + 5 * 18.998 = 186.21 + 94.99 = 281.2 g/mol\n*   Mass % of F: (94.99 / 281.2) * 100% = 33.78%\nThis value (33.78%) is not close enough to 31.96%.\n\nLet's re-examine the list. Let's assume A2 is ReF₆.\n*   Formula: ReF₆\n*   Molar Mass: 186.21 + 6 * 18.998 = 186.21 + 113.988 = 300.198 g/mol\n*   Mass % of F: (113.988 / 300.198) * 100% = 37.97%\nThis is also not a match.\n\nLet's try ReF₄.\n*   Formula: ReF₄\n*   Molar Mass: 186.21 + 4 * 18.998 = 186.21 + 75.992 = 262.202 g/mol\n*   Mass % of F: (75.992 / 262.202) * 100% = 28.98%\nThis is also not a match.\n\nThere might be an error in the problem's percentage, or we are on the wrong track. Let's reconsider another candidate from our list.\nIf x = 6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7. This is very close to Americium (Am, 243).\nLet's test if A2 = AmF₆.\n*   Mass % of F in AmF₆ = (6 * 19) / (243 + 6*19) = 114 / 357 = 31.93%.\nThis is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n\nLet's check if Americium fits the other clues:\n1.  **Five binary compounds with fluorine**: Americium is known to form AmF₂, AmF₃, AmF₄, and possibly AmF₅ and AmF₆, though the higher oxidation states are less stable. The existence of five compounds is plausible.\n2.  **A1 is bright-red, decomposes, and oxidizes Xenon**: The decomposition is A1 -> A2 + F₂. Since A2 = AmF₆, A1 must be a higher fluoride. Such a compound (e.g., AmF₇ or AmF₈) is unknown and highly unlikely. More probably, there's a typo in the question and A1 is the higher fluoride which decomposes to A2. Let's assume the decomposition is: A1 (e.g. AmF₄) -> A2 (e.g. AmF₃) + ½ F₂. But this contradicts A2 being AmF₆.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem's text. Perhaps the compound A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, but A2 is not the direct product, but one of the resulting species. The decomposition of a bright-red higher fluoride of a transition metal (like ReF₇) could be complex.\n\nLet's assume Y=Rhenium despite the mass percentage discrepancy, as its chemical properties are a strong fit. Rhenium forms ReF₄, ReF₅, ReF₆, and ReF₇. The existence of five fluorides is often cited.\n*   **A1**: The highest oxide, ReF₇, is yellow. This doesn't match \"bright-red\".\n*   **A3**: This is another fluoride that interacts with Xenon. ReF₆ reacts with Xe to form [XeF][ReF₆]. This fits.\n\nLet's try **Krypton (Kr)** as element Y.\n*   Ar(Kr) = 83.8 g/mol. From our formula, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 for x=2.\n*   If A2 = KrF₂, Mass % F = (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 38) = 38 / 121.8 = 31.2%. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\n*   **Five binary compounds**: This is false for Krypton. Only KrF₂ and KrF₄ (unstable) are known.\n*   **A1 oxidizes Xenon**: Krypton compounds like KrF₂ are exceptionally strong oxidizers and will oxidize xenon.\n*   **A1 bright-red**: KrF₂ is a white solid.\nThis hypothesis fails on multiple points.\n\nLet's assume the given percentage is correct and re-evaluate our calculation which led to Americium.\n*   Y = Am\n*   A2 = AmF₆\n*   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into AmF₆ and F₂. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride like AmF₈, which is highly speculative. However, Am(VI) is a very strong oxidant.\n\nLet's consider the last piece of information.\n*   Y + A4 -> A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n*   A4 is a colorless concentrated solution.\n*   A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n\nIf Y=Am, the reaction is: Am + A4 -> A5.\nA4 is a fluoride of Americium. Let's assume A4 is AmF₄ in a solvent. Adding Am metal would reduce it: Am + 3AmF₄ -> 4AmF₃. The ratio is not 1:1.\nThe statement \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" suggests A4 is dissolved in something. An aqueous solution is unlikely for reactive fluorides. A common solvent for fluorination chemistry is anhydrous HF (aHF).\n\nConsider A4 to be an acid. A common acid formed from these types of fluorides is a fluoroacid, like H₂[YFₙ₊₂].\nIf A4 = H₂[AmF₈], this acid is known (formed from AmF₆).\nAm + H₂[AmF₈] -> ??? This reaction is not straightforward.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"five compounds\" clue. This points strongly to Rhenium (Re) or a similar transition metal. Let's assume the mass % was a typo and should have been closer to that of ReF₄ (28.98%) or ReF₅ (33.78%). Or that the decomposition product is complex.\n\nLet's work backward from the final reaction, assuming Y=Re.\nRe + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nA4 is likely an oxyfluoride acid of Rhenium dissolved in water (\"concentrated solution\", which can be aqueous). A5 decomposes in water. This is consistent with many Re compounds.\nA common, stable, colorless Rhenium species in water is the perrhenate ion, [ReO₄]⁻, forming perrhenic acid HReO₄.\nLet's assume **A4 is perrhenic acid, HReO₄**. It is commercially available as a colorless aqueous solution.\n\nThe reaction is:\nRe + HReO₄ -> A5\nThis is a comproportionation reaction.\nRe(0) + Re(VII) -> A5\nThe oxidation state of Re in A5 would be intermediate. For a 1:1 reaction, the product would have an average oxidation state that might not be an integer or could be a mixture. However, in many comproportionation reactions, a stable intermediate state is formed, and the stoichiometry is balanced accordingly.\nA known stable oxide of Rhenium is ReO₂ (Rhenium(IV) dioxide). Let's see if the reaction can form this:\nRe + 2HReO₄ → 3ReO₂ + H₂O\nThis does not have a 1:1 molar ratio of Re to HReO₄.\n\nAnother possibility involves the solvent. \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" could imply a non-aqueous solvent, but if we consider it as aqueous HReO₄, it is a good candidate for A4.\n\nLet's assume A4 is HReO₄.\nMolecular Weight of HReO₄ = 1.008 (H) + 186.21 (Re) + 4 * 16.00 (O)\nMW = 1.008 + 186.21 + 64.00 = 251.218 g/mol.\nThis falls into the range 220-240 if we consider some rounding.\n\nLet's check if this is consistent.\n*   **Y = Re**. Forms many fluorides (ReF₄, ReF₅, ReF₆, ReF₇), fitting \"five compounds\".\n*   **A3 interacts with Xe**: ReF₆ reacts with Xe. A3=ReF₆.\n*   **A1 is bright-red, decomposes, strong oxidant**: This points to something like ReF₇ (yellow, not red) or an oxyfluoride. The properties of all five compounds are not fully specified, but Rhenium has highly oxidizing fluorides. Let's assume this clue points to a less common Re compound.\n*   **A2 has ɷF=31,96%**: This is the main conflicting point. No simple fluoride of Rhenium matches this. However, given the strong fit of all other clues for Y=Re and A4=HReO₄, it is plausible there is an error in this number in the problem statement.\n*   **A4 is HReO₄**: A stable compound, forms colorless aqueous solutions.\n*   **A5 formation**: Reaction between Re and HReO₄.\n*   **A5 decomposition in water**: If A5 is ReO₂, it is stable in water. However, the reaction could yield another species like Re₂O₅, which would hydrolyze. The reaction `Re + 2HReO4 → 3ReO2 + H2O` shows it's plausible.\n\nGiven the options, the molecular weight of HReO₄ (251.2 g/mol) is outside all ranges. Let me re-calculate.\nMW = 1.008 + 186.21 + 64.00 = 251.218. Let's re-read the options.\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 160-180\nD) 220-240\nMy result 251.2 is closest to D, but still outside.\n\nLet's reconsider A4. \"a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A4 itself is the solute. A4 could be a solid that is dissolved. If A4 is a binary fluoride, which one is soluble and colorless? None are particularly soluble in water without reaction.\n\nWhat if Y is not Rhenium? What if the Americium hypothesis (Y=Am, A2=AmF₆) is correct, and the reaction `Am + A4 -> A5` is the key?\nLet's assume A4 is an Americium compound. Perhaps a fluoroacid like H[AmF₅] or H₂[AmF₆]?\nMW(H[AmF₅]) = 1 + 243 + 5*19 = 339 g/mol.\nMW(H₂[AmF₆]) = 2 + 243 + 6*19 = 359 g/mol.\nThese are too high.\n\nLet's go back to the HReO₄ hypothesis. Is there a mistake in my calculation or assumptions?\nMW(HReO₄) = 251.2 g/mol.\nRange D is 220-240. The value is off by ~11.\nWhat if A4 is not an acid, but an oxide? The most common oxide is Re₂O₇.\nMW(Re₂O₇) = 2*186.21 + 7*16 = 372.42 + 112 = 484.42 g/mol. Too high. Re₂O₇ is a colorless solid. Its solution in water is HReO₄. So \"solution of A4\" could mean aqueous solution of Re₂O₇, which is HReO₄.\n\nThere must be a simpler explanation. Let's look at the candidates again.\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x.\nIf x=3, Ar(Y)=121.3. Close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\nLet's check Sb. Fluorides: SbF₃, SbF₅. Only two. Fails.\nIf x=4, Ar(Y)=161.8. Close to Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5). Unlikely lanthanide chemistry.\nIf Y=Iodine, Ar(I)=126.9. %F in IF₃ is 31.0%. It's close.\nIf Y=I, what is A4? An iodine compound forming a colorless solution. Periodic acid (HIO₄ or H₅IO₆).\nMW(HIO₄) = 1+127+64 = 192 g/mol. Not in ranges.\nMW(H₅IO₆) = 5+127+96 = 228 g/mol. This falls in range D (220-240).\nLet's check this. A4 = H₅IO₆.\nReaction: I + H₅IO₆ -> A5 (1:1). `I + H5IO6 -> ?` This reaction is not standard.\nAlso, IF₅ and IF₇ are colorless, not \"bright-red\". So Iodine is unlikely.\n\nThe Rhenium/HReO₄ hypothesis seems the most chemically sound, despite the conflict with the mass percentage and the final molecular weight being slightly out of range. Perhaps A4 is not HReO₄, but a different compound related to Rhenium.\nWhat if A4 is Rhenium heptafluoride, ReF₇? It's a low-melting solid (48°C), could be used in a \"hot... solution\".\nMW(ReF₇) = 186.21 + 7*19 = 319.2 g/mol. Too high.\n\nGiven the high consistency of the Rhenium hypothesis for most clues and the fact that H₅IO₆ has a MW in the correct range but fails on other clues, there might be an error in the problem data. However, if we must choose, the H₅IO₆ path gives a MW that perfectly fits an answer choice. Let's re-evaluate iodine.\nY = I. Five fluorides? Let's assume yes for the sake of the problem. A1 is bright-red? Maybe an impure sample or an unknown compound. Let's ignore this clue. A1 oxidizes Xe? IF₇ can react with Xe sources, but doesn't directly oxidize Xe metal easily.\nThis path seems weak.\n\nLet's trust the H₅IO₆ molecular weight. It's 228 g/mol. This falls squarely in the 220-240 range. Despite the chemical inconsistencies with Iodine, this numerical match is very strong. Often in such problems, one path leads to a perfect numerical fit.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for A2 can be written as YF_n.\n    The mass percentage formula is: ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n    Using the atomic weight of Fluorine (Ar(F) ≈ 19 g/mol):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (Ar(Y) + n * 19)\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for the atomic weight of Y (Ar(Y)):\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 19n - 6.0724n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 12.9276n\n    Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now, we test integer values for 'n' (the oxidation state of Y) to find a matching element:\n    *   n=1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 (No suitable element)\n    *   n=2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 (Close to Bromine, Ar(Br)=79.9)\n    *   n=3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 (Very close to Antimony, Ar(Sb)=121.76)\n    *   n=4: Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 (No suitable element)\n    *   n=5: Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 (No good match)\n    *   n=6: Ar(Y) ≈ 242.6 (Close to Plutonium, Ar(Pu)=244)\n\n    Let's check the candidates by calculating the theoretical mass percentage:\n    *   For BrF2: %F = (2 * 19) / (79.9 + 38) = 32.23%\n    *   For SbF3: %F = (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 57) = 31.89%\n    *   For PuF6: %F = (6 * 19) / (244 + 114) = 31.84%\n\n    Both Antimony (Sb) and Plutonium (Pu) give a mass percentage very close to the given 31.96%. However, the descriptions of the reactions will help us distinguish between them.\n\n2.  **Analyze the decomposition of A1.**\n    The problem states: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 ... and fluorine.\"\n    This means the reaction is: A1 → A2 + F₂.\n    This implies that A1 has a higher fluorine-to-Y ratio than A2.\n\n    *   **If Y=Pu**, the mass percentage calculation suggested A2=PuF6. If so, A1 would have to be PuF_x where x>6, which is not a known compound. Thus, the Plutonium hypothesis fails here.\n    *   **If Y=Sb**, the mass percentage calculation suggests A2=SbF3. Therefore, A1 must be a higher fluoride. The other common fluoride of antimony is SbF5. The reaction would be SbF5 → SbF3 + F₂. This is chemically plausible, although the problem's description of A1's properties (bright-red, decomposes at 293K) does not match SbF5 (colorless liquid, stable). We will proceed with Y=Sb as it's the most consistent choice based on the numerical data, acknowledging a likely inaccuracy in the descriptive text of A1.\n\n3.  **Identify the other substances.**\n    *   Y = Antimony (Sb)\n    *   A2 = Antimony trifluoride (SbF3)\n    *   A1 = Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) (based on the decomposition reaction)\n    *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\" (Sb + F₂ → SbF₃ or SbF₅).\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" SbF5 is a very strong Lewis acid and is known to form adducts with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF₂·SbF₅). SbF3 is much less reactive in this regard. Thus, A3 = SbF5.\n\n4.  **Analyze the final reaction to identify A4.**\n    \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    The reaction is: Y + A4 → A5, which is Sb + A4 → A5.\n    This describes the use of elemental antimony (oxidation state 0) to react with one of its fluorides (A4) to produce another fluoride (A5). This is a comproportionation reaction, where the elemental antimony must reduce the antimony in A4 to a lower oxidation state in A5.\n    This means A4 must be the higher-oxidation-state fluoride, SbF5, and A5 must be the lower-oxidation-state fluoride, SbF3.\n    The reaction is: Sb + SbF5 → SbF3\n    Let's check for consistency:\n    *   A4 is dissolved in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". SbF5 is a colorless liquid/solid that can be used in solutions. This fits.\n    *   A5 would be SbF3. This is consistent with A2 also being SbF3.\n    The balanced chemical reaction is `2 Sb + 3 SbF5 → 5 SbF3`. The 1:1 molar ratio given in the problem is incorrect, which is a common feature in complex chemistry problems to test understanding of the underlying principles over stoichiometric details.\n    Based on this analysis, A4 must be Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\n\n5.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n    We need to find the molecular weight of A4 = SbF5.\n    Atomic weight of Antimony (Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol.\n    Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    Molecular Weight (M) of SbF5 = Ar(Sb) + 5 * Ar(F)\n    M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n    Now we check the given ranges:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 110-130\n\n    The calculated molecular weight of 216.76 g/mol does not fall into any of these ranges. Let's re-examine our assignments. What if the reduction goes the other way? `A4 + SbF3 -> SbF5`? No, you cannot add elemental Sb to SbF3 to get SbF5.\n\n    Let's reconsider the reaction `2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3`.\n    I assumed A4=SbF5 and A5=SbF3.\n    What if A4 = SbF3 and A5=SbF5? The reaction would be `Sb + SbF3 -> SbF5`. This is an oxidation of both Sb species, which is not possible without an external oxidizing agent.\n\n    There seems to be an error in the problem statement or the options. Let's re-evaluate the initial mass calculation.\n    Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    Let's suppose n=4 is correct and Y is not a common element. Ar(Y) = 161.8. Let's call it 'X'.\n    A2 = XF4. M(XF4) = 161.8 + 4*19 = 237.8. %F = 76/237.8 = 31.96%. Perfect match.\n    So, Y is an element with Ar ≈ 161.8. Looking at the periodic table, Dysprosium (Dy) has Ar=162.5.\n    Let's test Y = Dy.\n    A2 = DyF4. M = 162.5 + 4*19 = 238.5. %F = 76/238.5 = 31.86%. Very good match.\n    Let's follow this hypothesis.\n    *   Y = Dysprosium (Dy).\n    *   Known fluorides are DyF2, DyF3. DyF4 is known but unstable.\n    *   A2 = DyF4.\n    *   A1 -> DyF4 + F2. This would mean A1 is DyF5, which is unknown. The lanthanides don't typically reach +5.\n\n    Let's go back to the most chemically sound deduction: Y=Sb, A2=SbF3, A4=SbF5. The MW is ~217 g/mol. This is very close to range B (220-240). It's possible the ranges are slightly off or based on approximations. However, there is a better explanation.\n\n    Let's re-read the final reaction clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    It is possible I have misidentified A4 and A5. Let's swap them.\n    Reaction: Sb + A5 → A4 (1:1 ratio)\n    Let's assume A5 is the reactant and A4 is the product. But the sentence says \"adding Y ... to a ... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\". This structure implies A4 is the reactant and A5 is the product.\n\n    Given the high confidence in Y=Sb and A2=SbF3, and the chemical logic that leads to A4=SbF5, there must be an error in the question's provided ranges. The calculated value for M(SbF5) is 216.76 g/mol. Let's re-examine the options. It is possible that A4 is actually SbF3. Let's test this possibility.\n\n    If A4 = SbF3, what would the reaction be? `Sb + SbF3 -> ?`. This doesn't seem right.\n    However, if we are forced to choose an answer from the options, let's look at the MW of the other compound, SbF3.\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    This value, 178.76 g/mol, falls perfectly into range A (160-180).\n\n    Now, we must find a chemical justification for A4 being SbF3. This requires re-interpreting the last clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    Could the reaction be an oxidation? Perhaps using a different reagent mentioned implicitly? Or maybe it's not a redox reaction.\n    Example: `SbCl3 + 3HF -> SbF3 + 3HCl`. This is a synthesis, but doesn't match the prompt `Y + A4 -> A5`.\n    What if the solution is not inert? For example, if A4 (SbF3) is dissolved in BrF3 (a fluorinating solvent) and Sb is added? The chemistry gets too speculative.\n\n    Let's assume there is a significant error in the last clue's description and that our identification of the compounds is correct: the two main compounds are SbF3 and SbF5. One of them is A4.\n    M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol (fits range A)\n    M(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol (does not fit any range)\n    Given that one of the options must be correct, the only possibility is that A4 is SbF3. This implies there is a severe error in the problem's description of the reaction used to make A5, but that the identity of A4 is SbF3. The problem is flawed, but a choice must be made based on the plausible chemical species derived.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Element Y = Sb is the best fit for the mass percentage.\n*   This means the compounds are fluorides of antimony.\n*   The primary candidates for A4 are SbF3 and SbF5.\n*   M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol, which is in the range 160-180.\n*   M(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol, which is not in any of the provided ranges.\n*   Therefore, despite the confusing final clue, A4 must be SbF3 for its molecular weight to match one of the options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y\nThe problem describes a series of reactions involving five binary fluorides of an element Y. A key piece of information is that substance A2, a fluoride of Y, has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ (assuming a single atom of Y, which is common for simple binary compounds).\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWhere M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\nRearranging for M(Y):\nM(Y) * 0.3196 = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\nM(Y) = n * (19.00 * 0.6804 / 0.3196)\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\nWe also know that some of these fluorides (A1, A3) are extremely strong oxidizing agents, capable of reacting with Xenon. This points to elements that can achieve very high oxidation states, such as the later actinides or some p-block/d-block elements. High oxidation states are common for fluorides. Let's test plausible integer values for n, the oxidation state of Y in A2.\n\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 (Ca, Sc). Not known for such reactive fluorides.\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 (Br, Se). Selenium is a possibility.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 (Sb). Antimony forms SbF₃, SbF₅.\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 (Dy, Tb). Lanthanides, can reach +4 state.\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 (Au, Hg, Bi). Bismuth forms BiF₅.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7. This is very close to the molar masses of late actinides like Americium (Am, 243 g/mol) and Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n\nActinides like Pu and Am are well-known for forming multiple, highly reactive fluorides, including hexafluorides (YF₆). This is a very strong match.\nLet's verify with Y = Americium (Am, M=243 g/mol) and A2 = AmF₆ (n=6).\nɷF(AmF₆) = (6 * 19) / (243 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 357 ≈ 0.3193 = 31.93%.\nThis is extremely close to the given 31.96%. Thus, it's highly probable that **Y is Americium (Am)** and **A2 is Americium Hexafluoride (AmF₆)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify A1, A3, and A5\n*   **A1**: Decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (AmF₆) and fluorine. This means A1 is a higher, unstable fluoride, like a hypothetical AmF₇ or AmF₈. Its properties (bright-red, unstable, oxidizes xenon) are consistent with a \"super-fluoride\".\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Y (Am) and it also reacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of americium can produce its highest stable fluoride, AmF₆. AmF₆ is an extremely strong oxidizing agent and would react with xenon. So, **A3 is also AmF₆**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The core reaction is: Y + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio). The reaction takes place in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". Since Y (Am) is an element (a metal), it will act as a reducing agent. A4 must be an oxidizing agent. The fact that the solution of A4 is colorless and the context of Xenon reactivity strongly suggest that A4 could be a fluoride of a noble gas, like krypton or xenon, which are colorless solids that can form colorless solutions in anhydrous HF.\n\n### Step 3: Identify A4 by analyzing the reaction\nThe reaction is **Am + A4 → A5** with a **1:1 molar ratio**. This implies a direct relationship between the number of electrons lost by one atom of Americium and the number of electrons gained by one molecule of A4.\nAm → Amⁿ⁺ + n e⁻\nA4 + n e⁻ → Products\n\nLet's test potential candidates for A4 that fit the description and the MW ranges.\n\n*   **Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**: MW = 121.8 g/mol (Range B).\n    *   Reaction: Kr(II) + 2e⁻ → Kr(0). This requires n=2.\n    *   So, Am + KrF₂ → AmF₂ + Kr. The product is Am(II). This is a possible oxidation state.\n    *   However, KrF₂ is unstable and decomposes upon heating. The reaction in a \"hot\" solution makes this choice unlikely.\n\n*   **Xenon difluoride (XeF₂)**: MW = 169.3 g/mol (**Range A**).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(II) + 2e⁻ → Xe(0). This requires n=2.\n    *   So, Am + XeF₂ → AmF₂ + Xe. The product is Am(II). This is chemically plausible, although Am(III) is more stable. The product A5 would be AmF₂, which is known to decompose in water. This is a strong candidate.\n\n*   **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**: MW = 207.3 g/mol (Not in any range).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(IV) + 4e⁻ → Xe(0). This requires n=4.\n    *   So, Am + XeF₄ → AmF₄ + Xe. The product is Am(IV), a known oxidation state. Chemically, this is very sound. However, its molecular weight does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n\n*   **Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆)**: MW = 245.3 g/mol (Very close to, but outside of Range D: 220-240).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(VI) + 6e⁻ → Xe(0). This requires n=6.\n    *   So, Am + XeF₆ → AmF₆ + Xe. The product is Am(VI), which matches A2 and A3. This is chemically plausible. The only issue is the molecular weight being slightly outside the given range.\n\n*   **Iodine pentafluoride (IF₅)**: MW = 221.9 g/mol (**Range D**).\n    *   Reaction: I(V) + 2e⁻ → I(III) (as IF₃). This requires n=2.\n    *   So, Am + IF₅ → AmF₂ + IF₃. The product is Am(II). This is plausible. A5 would be a mixture of AmF₂ and IF₃, both of which decompose in water.\n    *   However, the problem has strong thematic links to Xenon chemistry, making an iodine compound a less likely answer.\n\n### Step 4: Final Evaluation and Conclusion\nWe are left with two primary candidates that fit a range and have plausible (if not perfect) chemistry:\n1.  **A4 = XeF₂** (MW 169.3 g/mol, in Range A). Thematic link is strong.\n2.  **A4 = IF₅** (MW 221.9 g/mol, in Range D). No thematic link.\n\nThe problem's repeated mention of xenon (A1 oxidizes Xe, A3 interacts with Xe) is a significant hint that the chemistry is centered around species of this type. This makes XeF₂ a far more probable candidate for A4 than IF₅ or any other non-xenon compound. The reaction Am + XeF₂ → AmF₂ + Xe is stoichiometrically balanced in a 1:1 ratio. While Am(III) is generally more stable, the formation of Am(II) under specific conditions is not impossible, and for the sake of the puzzle's constraints, it is a valid pathway.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that A4 is XeF₂.\nThe molecular weight of XeF₂ is M(Xe) + 2 * M(F) ≈ 131.3 + 2 * 19.0 = 169.3 g/mol.\nThis value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that compound A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, and `n` is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    We can plug in the given values and rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y) in terms of `n`:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00 * n) = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * n = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now, we test plausible integer values for `n` (the valency or number of fluorine atoms) to find a corresponding element Y.\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ca, but Ca does not fit the described chemistry of forming five fluorides).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br, or Krypton, Kr, but this is less likely given the other clues).\n    *   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol. Antimony is known to form multiple fluorides and fits the description of an element \"Y\".\n    *   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No common element fits this well).\n\n    The best fit is Y = Antimony (Sb) and n = 3. This means **A2 is SbF3**. Let's verify the fluorine mass percentage in SbF3 using more precise molar masses (M(Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol, M(F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol).\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 18.998) / (121.76 + 3 * 18.998) = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that Y is Sb and A2 is SbF3.\n\n2.  **Identify Other Compounds.**\n    *   The five binary compounds are fluorides of antimony. The two most stable and common are SbF3 (antimony trifluoride) and SbF5 (antimony pentafluoride).\n    *   A1 and A3 are described as oxidizing agents for xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is a very powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent capable of reacting with xenon. Therefore, it is highly likely that **A3 = SbF5**.\n    *   We are looking for the molecular weight range of A4. The most logical candidates for A4 are the two stable fluorides: SbF3 or SbF5. The other \"compounds\" mentioned are likely complexes or less stable species (A1, A5).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of Potential Candidates for A4.**\n    Let's calculate the molecular weight for both SbF3 and SbF5 and see which one fits the given options.\n    *   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF3**\n        Molecular Weight (MW) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\n        MW(SbF3) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF5**\n        Molecular Weight (MW) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\n        MW(SbF5) = 121.76 g/mol + 5 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 95.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n4.  **Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Ranges.**\n    Now, we check which of these calculated molecular weights falls into the answer choices:\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 110-130\n\n    *   The MW of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit into any range. It is close to range A, but outside of it.\n    *   The MW of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range **B) 160-180**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the strong quantitative evidence, compound A4 must be SbF3. The description of the reaction involving A4 (`Sb + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 ratio) is confusing and chemically unusual for SbF3, but in puzzle-like problems, the quantitative data is often the most reliable clue. The calculation of the molecular weight provides a clear and unambiguous answer.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is approximately 179 g/mol, which lies in the range 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nMy apologies, the previous code failed because the `periodictable` library is not available. I can perform the calculation manually without needing a special library.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The most critical clue is the composition of substance A2. A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's denote the formula of A2 as YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, Ar(Y) is the atomic weight of Y, and Ar(F) is the atomic weight of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for Ar(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (Ar(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * (Ar(Y) + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 12.9276n\n    Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\n    Now we test integer values for `n` to find a plausible element from the periodic table:\n    *   If n=1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca, 40.08 g/mol), but a Group 2 metal fluoride does not fit the described chemistry (oxidizing xenon, etc.).\n    *   If n=2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol), but its chemistry is also not a perfect match for the higher oxidation states required.\n    *   If n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol). Antimony is a p-block element known to form multiple fluorides and exhibit the kind of reactivity described. Let's verify this.\n    *   If Y = Sb and n = 3, then A2 = SbF3. The mass percentage of F in SbF3 is:\n        ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Compounds:**\n    *   **Y = Sb (Antimony)**\n    *   **A2 = SbF3 (Antimony trifluoride)**\n    *   The problem mentions five binary fluorides. The most common are SbF3 and SbF5.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Sb) and it reacts with xenon. This points to the highest fluoride, which is a powerful Lewis acid. **A3 = SbF5 (Antimony pentafluoride)**. SbF5 is known to react with XeF2 to form salts like [XeF][SbF6].\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and F2 at room temperature. This suggests a less stable, higher fluoride than SbF3. This might be a more exotic fluoride or a slight inaccuracy in the problem description, but it doesn't hinder solving for A4.\n\n3.  **Determine A4:** The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. A4 is one of the binary compounds of Sb and F. The most likely candidates are the stable ones: SbF3 and SbF5.\n\n    Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF3:**\n        MW(SbF3) = Ar(Sb) + 3 * Ar(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 57 = **178.76 g/mol**\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF5:**\n        MW(SbF5) = Ar(Sb) + 5 * Ar(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95 = **216.76 g/mol**\n\n4.  **Match with the Given Ranges:**\n    *   A) 140-160\n    *   B) 110-130\n    *   C) 160-180\n    *   D) 220-240\n\n    The calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly into the range **160-180**.\n    The calculated molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the ranges.\n\n    Therefore, the substance A4 must be SbF3.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nI will solve this step-by-step, analyzing each piece of information provided in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the formula YFm. The mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) is given as 31.96%. We can use this to find a relationship between the atomic mass of Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (m).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))\n\nUsing the atomic mass of fluorine, M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol, and the given percentage:\n0.3196 = (m * 19.00) / (M(Y) + m * 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) + 19.00m = (m * 19.00) / 0.3196\nM(Y) + 19.00m ≈ 59.45m\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45m\n\nNow, we can test integer values for 'm' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find plausible atomic masses for element Y.\n*   If m = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium)\n*   If m = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine)\n*   If m = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, M=121.76 g/mol)\n*   If m = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, Dy, M=162.50 g/mol)\n*   If m = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Gold or Mercury)\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical fluorine percentage for the most likely candidates:\n*   For Y = Sb (Antimony) and m = 3 (compound SbF3):\n    ωF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96% (a relative difference of only 0.25%).\n*   For Y = Dy (Dysprosium) and m = 4 (compound DyF4):\n    ωF(DyF4) = (4 * 19.00) / (162.50 + 4 * 19.00) = 76 / 238.50 ≈ 0.31865 or 31.87%. This is also extremely close.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the chemical properties to identify Y.**\n\nLet's compare the chemical properties of Antimony and Dysprosium with the problem description.\n*   **A1 oxidizes xenon:** This implies A1 is a very strong oxidizing agent, typically a high-valent fluoride. Antimony forms SbF5, which is a very strong Lewis acid and can participate in reactions that oxidize xenon (e.g., forming salts like [XeF][Sb2F11]). A hypothetical higher fluoride of antimony (A1) would be an even stronger oxidizer. Dysprosium is an electropositive lanthanide metal and is not known to form compounds that can oxidize xenon. This strongly favors **Y = Sb**.\n*   **Other clues:** While other clues like \"five binary compounds\" and \"bright-red substance A1\" do not perfectly match the known chemistry of antimony (only SbF3 and SbF5 are common, and both are colorless/white), these are more likely to be idealized or erroneous statements in a complex problem than the core chemical reactivity and mass percentage data. For instance, A1 could be a hypothetical unstable, colored higher fluoride that decomposes to A2.\n\nBased on the combination of the mass percentage calculation and chemical properties, we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** (Antimony) and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the other substances, particularly A4.**\n\nWith Y = Sb, we can deduce the identities of the other compounds.\n*   **A2 = SbF3**.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y and interacts with xenon:** The exhaustive fluorination of antimony yields antimony pentafluoride, SbF5. SbF5 is a known interactor with xenon. So, **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine:** This means A1 must be a higher fluoride than SbF3. The most logical candidate is SbF5, though the decomposition conditions given are unusual.\n*   **A4 is used in a reaction with element Y:** The reaction is described as \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\". This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state (Y) reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state (A4) to form a product in an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n\nThe most well-known comproportionation reaction for antimony is:\n2 Sb(0) + 3 SbF5(+5) → 5 SbF3(+3)\n\nFor this type of reaction to occur, A4 must be the compound with Y in the higher oxidation state. Therefore, **A4 must be SbF5**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\nNow we calculate the molecular weight of A4, which we have identified as SbF5.\n*   Atomic mass of Antimony (Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Fluorine (F) = 19.00 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight (MW) of SbF5 = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\nMW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00\nMW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 95.00\n**MW(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol**\n\nNow we check which of the given ranges this molecular weight falls into.\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 216.76 g/mol does not fall neatly into any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to the lower boundary of range D (220-240). In the context of multiple-choice questions with potential for slight rounding or non-ideal ranges, 216.76 g/mol is unambiguously associated with range D. No other plausible identification of A4 leads to a molecular weight close to any of the other ranges. For instance, if A4 were SbF3, its MW would be 178.76 g/mol (Range B), but this contradicts the chemical logic of the comproportionation reaction. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that A4 is SbF5, and its molecular weight belongs in the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the data for substance A2.**\n    A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the formula YFm. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given as 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    `ɷF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))`\n    Where M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\n    Let's rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    `0.3196 = (m * 19.00) / (M(Y) + m * 19.00)`\n    `0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00m) = 19.00m`\n    `0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724m = 19.00m`\n    `0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276m`\n    `M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * m`\n    `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m`\n\n    Now, we need to find an element Y and an integer `m` (a plausible oxidation state) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for `m`:\n    *   m = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to K, Ca, Sc). None of these fit the later chemical descriptions (e.g., forming 5 fluorides, oxidizing xenon).\n    *   m = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br, Se, Kr). These were considered and ruled out based on other properties described in the problem.\n    *   m = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This molar mass is very close to that of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   m = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (similar to Tb, Dy). These are lanthanides, less likely to fit the overall description.\n    *   m = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi). Bismuth was checked and ruled out.\n\n2.  **Confirm Y is Antimony (Sb).**\n    Let's assume Y is Sb and `m=3`. This means A2 is antimony trifluoride (SbF3). Let's calculate the theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF3 to verify our assumption.\n    *   M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n    *   M(F) = 18.998 g/mol (using a more precise value)\n    *   M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n    *   ɷF = (3 * 18.998 / 178.754) * 100% = 31.88%\n    This calculated value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem statement. Thus, we can confidently identify **Y as Sb** and **A2 as SbF3**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4.**\n    The problem states that A4 is another binary compound of fluorine with element Y (Sb). The most common and stable binary fluorides of antimony are antimony trifluoride (SbF3) and antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). Therefore, A4 is likely one of these two compounds.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weights of the possible compounds for A4.**\n    *   **If A4 = SbF3**: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   **If A4 = SbF5**: M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Compare the calculated molecular weights with the given ranges.**\n    The question asks to identify the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls.\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 140-160\n\n    Comparing our calculated values:\n    *   M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol, which falls squarely within range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   M(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol, which does not fall into any of the given ranges. It is close to range A, but outside of it.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The molecular weight of SbF3 is a perfect match for one of the answer choices. This provides strong evidence that **A4 is SbF3**. The other chemical details in the problem (the color of A1, the stoichiometry of the reaction to form A5) appear to be either contradictory, erroneous, or require knowledge of very obscure chemistry. However, they are not needed to solve the central question, which relies on the numerical data provided for A2 and the molar mass ranges given in the options. Based on the molar mass calculation, A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic weight of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The mass fraction is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the atomic weight of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (12.9276) / 0.3196\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.5 g/mol (Calcium, but doesn't fit other criteria).\n    *   n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, but only has 3 main fluorides).\n    *   n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (Antimony, but only has 2 main fluorides).\n    *   n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Dysprosium/Terbium, do not have 5 fluorides or fit the reactivity).\n    *   n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol (Mercury/Thallium/Lead, do not fit the criteria).\n    *   n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Plutonium/Americium, actinides). Pu fits the reactivity but leads to contradictions.\n\n    Let's check non-metal halogens. Iodine (I) has an atomic weight of 126.9 g/mol.\n    If Y = I, then 126.9 ≈ 40.45 * n, which gives n ≈ 3.13. This suggests that n=3 is a very strong possibility.\n    Let's check if A2 = IF3.\n    The theoretical mass fraction of fluorine in IF3 is:\n    M(IF3) = 126.9 + 3 * 19.0 = 183.9 g/mol\n    ɷF(IF3) = (3 * 19.0) / 183.9 = 57.0 / 183.9 ≈ 0.3100 or 31.00%.\n    This value is very close to the given 31.96%. Chemistry problems from competitions can sometimes have slight inaccuracies in the provided data. This is the most plausible identification. So, we'll proceed with Y = Iodine (I) and A2 = IF3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of the Other Compounds.**\n    *   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Iodine) are known.\"** The main iodine fluorides are IF, IF3, IF5, and IF7. To reach five, one might count unstable species or dimers like I2F6. We'll assume this condition is met.\n    *   **\"A1 is a bright-red substance...\"**: This clue is problematic, as the common higher iodine fluorides (IF5, IF7) are colorless. This may be a red herring or an error in the problem statement. We can solve for A4 without a definitive identification of A1.\n    *   **\"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\"**: This is a key clue for identifying A4. A4 is one of the iodine fluorides. Let's look at their properties:\n        *   IF: Unstable solid, decomposes. Cannot form a hot concentrated solution.\n        *   IF3: Yellow solid, decomposes above -28°C. Cannot form a hot concentrated solution.\n        *   IF5: A stable, colorless liquid (m.p. 9.4 °C, b.p. 104.5 °C). It can exist as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" (it can be the solution itself). This is a perfect match.\n        *   IF7: A colorless gas at room temperature. Cannot form a hot concentrated solution.\n    Based on physical properties, **A4 must be IF5**.\n\n3.  **Confirm the Identification of A4 with the Reaction Clues.**\n    *   **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"**\n        *   Element Y is Iodine, which exists as I2. So, we add I2 to A4 (which we identified as IF5).\n        *   The reaction is: `I2 + IF5 -> A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio.\n        *   This could be the formation of a stable adduct, A5 = I2·IF5. This satisfies the 1:1 stoichiometry.\n    *   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"**\n        *   A5 (I2·IF5) would react with water. Iodine fluorides hydrolyze to form hydrofluoric acid (HF) and an iodine oxyacid (like HIO3). The iodine (I2) may remain. For example: `I2 + IF5 + 3H2O -> I2 + 5HF + HIO3`. In any case, it decomposes into multiple substances, fitting the clue.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Our identification leads to A4 being iodine pentafluoride (IF5).\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(A4) = M(IF5) = M(I) + 5 * M(F)\n    M(IF5) = 126.9 g/mol + 5 * 19.0 g/mol = 126.9 + 95.0 = 221.9 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 221.9 g/mol. We now check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 221.9 g/mol falls within the range 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the chemical formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms (which also represents the oxidation state of Y in this compound).\n\n    *   The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   The mass fraction formula is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    *   Substituting the given values: 0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n        *   0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\n        *   M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\n        *   M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can now test integer values for `n` to find a corresponding element Y with a matching molar mass. We will execute a short python script to check this relationship against the known elements.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_element(tolerance=1.0):\n        elements = {\n            \"H\": 1.008, \"He\": 4.0026, \"Li\": 6.94, \"Be\": 9.0122, \"B\": 10.81, \"C\": 12.011, \"N\": 14.007, \"O\": 15.999, \"F\": 18.998, \"Ne\": 20.180,\n            \"Na\": 22.990, \"Mg\": 24.305, \"Al\": 26.982, \"Si\": 28.085, \"P\": 30.974, \"S\": 32.06, \"Cl\": 35.45, \"Ar\": 39.948, \"K\": 39.098, \"Ca\": 40.078,\n            \"Sc\": 44.956, \"Ti\": 47.867, \"V\": 50.942, \"Cr\": 51.996, \"Mn\": 54.938, \"Fe\": 55.845, \"Co\": 58.933, \"Ni\": 58.693, \"Cu\": 63.546, \"Zn\": 65.38,\n            \"Ga\": 69.723, \"Ge\": 72.63, \"As\": 74.922, \"Se\": 78.971, \"Br\": 79.904, \"Kr\": 83.798, \"Rb\": 85.468, \"Sr\": 87.62, \"Y\": 88.906, \"Zr\": 91.224,\n            \"Nb\": 92.906, \"Mo\": 95.96, \"Tc\": 98, \"Ru\": 101.07, \"Rh\": 102.91, \"Pd\": 106.42, \"Ag\": 107.87, \"Cd\": 112.41, \"In\": 114.82, \"Sn\": 118.71,\n            \"Sb\": 121.76, \"Te\": 127.60, \"I\": 126.90, \"Xe\": 131.29, \"Cs\": 132.91, \"Ba\": 137.33, \"La\": 138.91, \"Ce\": 140.12, \"Pr\": 140.91, \"Nd\": 144.24,\n            \"Pm\": 145, \"Sm\": 150.36, \"Eu\": 151.96, \"Gd\": 157.25, \"Tb\": 158.93, \"Dy\": 162.50, \"Ho\": 164.93, \"Er\": 167.26, \"Tm\": 168.93, \"Yb\": 173.05,\n            \"Lu\": 174.97, \"Hf\": 178.49, \"Ta\": 180.95, \"W\": 183.84, \"Re\": 186.21, \"Os\": 190.23, \"Ir\": 192.22, \"Pt\": 195.08, \"Au\": 196.97, \"Hg\": 200.59,\n            \"Tl\": 204.38, \"Pb\": 207.2, \"Bi\": 208.98, \"Po\": 209, \"At\": 210, \"Rn\": 222, \"Fr\": 223, \"Ra\": 226, \"Ac\": 227, \"Th\": 232.04, \"Pa\": 231.04,\n            \"U\": 238.03, \"Np\": 237, \"Pu\": 244, \"Am\": 243, \"Cm\": 247, \"Bk\": 247, \"Cf\": 251, \"Es\": 252, \"Fm\": 257, \"Md\": 258, \"No\": 259, \"Lr\": 266\n        }\n        results = []\n        for n_val in range(1, 8):\n            M_Y = 40.45 * n_val\n            for symbol, mass in elements.items():\n                if abs(mass - M_Y) < tolerance:\n                    results.append((n_val, symbol, mass, M_Y))\n        print(\"Possible elements (n, Symbol, Actual Mass, Calculated Mass):\")\n        for r in results:\n            print(f\"n={r[0]}: {r[1]} (M={r[2]:.2f}).

While it wasn't on this specific list due to slight mass difference and tolerance, let's test it:\n    *   If Y = Kr (Krypton, M = 83.80 g/mol), for n=2, our formula gives M(Y) = 40.45 * 2 = 80.90 g/mol. This is reasonably close to Kr.\n    *   So, A2 = KrF₂. Let's verify the fluorine mass percentage in KrF₂:\n        M(KrF₂) = 83.80 + 2 * 19.00 = 121.80 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (2 * 19.00) / 121.80 = 38 / 121.80 = 0.3120 or 31.20%. This value is very close to the given 31.96%. The discrepancy is likely due to rounding of atomic masses or experimental data precision. Thus, Y is Krypton (Kr).\n\n2.  **Identify the Five Compounds A1-A5.**\n    Now that Y = Kr, let's use the other clues.\n    *   **A1** is a bright-red substance that decomposes to A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine at 293 K. The only known krypton fluoride higher than KrF₂ is KrF₄. It is also extremely unstable and would decompose as `KrF₄ -> KrF₂ + F₂`. While KrF₄'s color is debated (sometimes reported as red or colorless), its properties fit the description perfectly. Thus, **A1 = KrF₄**.\n    *   **A2** is **KrF₂**, as determined above.\n    *   **A1 (KrF₄) oxidizes xenon**. This is chemically correct; KrF₄ is a stronger oxidizing/fluorinating agent than Xe and would react with it.\n    *   **A3 can also interact with xenon**. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Kr with F₂. This sounds like KrF₂ or KrF₄. Since KrF₂ also reacts with Xe to form XeF₂ and Kr, A3 is likely KrF₂. But we have already identified A2 as KrF₂. For there to be five *different* compounds, A3 must be distinct. It is possible A3 refers to the same compound (KrF₂) used in a different context, but it's more likely a fifth compound. However, the known binary krypton fluorides are primarily KrF₂ and the highly unstable KrF₄. Other compounds like KrF are radical species. It is most plausible from the description that the primary compounds in the narrative are **KrF₄** and **KrF₂**.\n    *   Let's focus on A4 and A5, as A4 is the target of the question.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and A5.**\n    \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n    This describes the synthesis of a krypton-containing compound. Krypton clathrates are known compounds where Kr is trapped in a crystal lattice of another substance. One of the most common is the hydroquinone clathrate.\n    *   **A4**: Hydroquinone, C₆H₄(OH)₂. It forms colorless solutions.\n    *   Reaction: 3 C₆H₄(OH)₂ (A4) + Kr (Y) → [C₆H₄(OH)₂]₃·Kr (A5)\n        This is a typical formation of a clathrate, though the ratio is 3:1 hydroquinone to krypton. The \"1:1 molar ratio\" in the problem statement might refer to the ratio of reactants *added* rather than the stoichiometric ratio in the final product, which is common lab practice.\n    *   **A5**: Krypton-hydroquinone clathrate, [C₆H₄(OH)₂]₃·Kr.\n    *   **Decomposition in water**: When the clathrate A5 is dissolved in water, the weak van der Waals forces holding the cage together break, releasing the trapped krypton gas and dissolving the hydroquinone. So, the two substances formed are Krypton (Kr) and an aqueous solution of Hydroquinone (C₆H₄(OH)₂). This matches the description.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on our identification, A4 is hydroquinone.\n    *   Formula: C₆H₄(OH)₂\n    *   M(C) ≈ 12.01 g/mol\n    *   M(H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n    *   M(O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight (MW) = (6 * 12.01) + (6 * 1.01) + (2 * 16.00) = 72.06 + 6.06 + 32.00 = 110.12 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the Result with the Given Ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 110.12 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the range given in option D.\n    *   A) 140-160\n    *   B) 160-180\n    *   C) 220-240\n    *   D) 110-130\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 is in the range of 110-130 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe user's question is a multi-step chemistry puzzle. Let's break down the information to identify the unknown substances, particularly A4.\n\n**1. Analyzing the clues**\n\n*   **Element Y:** Forms at least five binary fluorides. This suggests Y could be a halogen (like I, Br), a chalcogen (Se, Te), a pnictogen (P, As, Sb), or a transition metal (like Ru, Rh, Pt, U).\n*   **A2 Composition:** The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The mass percentage is given by:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.0) / (M(Y) + n * 19.0)\n    Solving for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n * (1 - 0.3196) = 19n * 0.6804\n    M(Y) ≈ n * (12.9276 / 0.3196) ≈ n * 40.45 g/mol\n*   **A1 Properties:** It's a bright-red substance, decomposes at room temperature (293 K) into A2 and fluorine gas (A1 → A2 + F₂), and is a powerful enough oxidant to react with Xenon. The decomposition to A2 and F₂ implies that the oxidation state of Y in A1 is higher than in A2.\n*   **A3 Properties:** Can be formed by direct fluorination of Y and also reacts with Xenon. This suggests A3 is a high-oxidation-state fluoride.\n*   **A4 and A5 Formation:** A5 is formed by reacting Y and A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. `Y + A4 → A5`. This is a classic comproportionation reaction, where an element in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with a compound of the same element in a high oxidation state (A4) to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n*   **A4 Properties:** It forms a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". The \"colorless\" property is a very strong hint, often ruling out transition metal compounds which are typically colored. This points towards main-group elements.\n\n**2. Identifying Element Y and the Compounds**\n\nLet's test some candidate elements for Y using the M(Y) ≈ n * 40.45 relationship derived from the composition of A2.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Y = Antimony (Sb)**, M(Sb) ≈ 121.8 g/mol.\n    If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 3 * 40.45 = 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony's mass. So, A2 could be **SbF₃**. Let's verify the mass percent for SbF₃: (3*19)/(121.8+3*19) ≈ 31.88%. This is a good match.\n    *   Let's check other clues. If Y=Sb, A4 would be a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅. SbF₅ is a strong oxidant (reacts with Xe) and is colorless. This fits well. The reaction to form A5 would be `Sb + SbF₅ → A5`. However, the well-known comproportionation reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. This is not a 1:1 molar ratio, contradicting a key clue.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of A4=SbF₅. MW ≈ 121.8 + 5*19 = 216.8 g/mol. This value is not in any of the provided ranges (A, B, C, D). So, Sb is unlikely.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Y = Iodine (I)**, M(I) ≈ 126.9 g/mol.\n    If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is reasonably close. Let's assume A2 is **IF₃**. The theoretical ɷF for IF₃ is (3*19)/(126.9+3*19) ≈ 30.99%. This is somewhat off from 31.96%, but given the other constraints, let's proceed.\n    *   Let's check the crucial A4/A5 reaction. The problem states a 1:1 molar ratio: `Y + A4 → A5`. Let's assume this means one atom of Iodine reacts with one molecule of an iodine fluoride. A chemically plausible comproportionation is:\n        I + IF₅ → 2IF₃ (Oxidation states: 0, +5 → +3)\n    *   This implies: **A4 = IF₅** and **A5 = IF₃**.\n    *   Let's check the clues for A4=IF₅. Is it colorless? Yes, IF₅ is a colorless liquid. Can it form a hot concentrated solution? Yes. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the molecular weight of **A4 = IF₅**.\n        MW(IF₅) = M(I) + 5 * M(F) = 126.9 + 5 * 19.0 = 126.9 + 95 = **221.9 g/mol**.\n    *   Let's look at the answer options:\n        A) 140-160\n        B) 160-180\n        C) 220-240\n        D) 110-130\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of 221.9 g/mol falls squarely in the range **220-240**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite some ambiguities in the description of compound A1 (no common iodine fluoride is bright red), the evidence pointing to Y=Iodine and A4=IF₅ is very strong and is the only hypothesis that leads to a molecular weight consistent with the given options. The colorless nature of the A4 solution and the resulting molecular weight are the decisive factors.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the properties of compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that compound A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 is a higher fluoride of element Y than A2. The mass percentage (ɷF) of fluorine in A2 is given as 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\nThe molar mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is calculated as:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWe are given ɷF = 0.3196. Let's set up the equation to find the molar mass of Y (M(Y)).\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19n) = 19n\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n - 6.0724n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow, we test integer values for n (the number of fluorine atoms, representing the oxidation state) to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y.\n\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but Ca chemistry doesn't fit the problem's description).\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine, but BrF₂ is not the formula for a stable binary compound that would be a decomposition product).\n*   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Antimony, Sb=121.76, but SbF₃ is white and antimony fluorides are not known to oxidize xenon).\n*   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (no element fits well).\n*   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (very close to **Gold (Au)**, with an atomic mass of 196.97 g/mol).\n*   If n = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.70 g/mol (close to Americium/Plutonium, but as we'll see, Gold is a much better fit for all clues).\n\nLet's assume Y is Gold (Au). Then n=5, and A2 is **AuF₅**.\nLet's verify the mass percentage for AuF₅:\nM(AuF₅) = 196.97 + 5 * 19.00 = 196.97 + 95 = 291.97 g/mol.\nɷF = (95 / 291.97) * 100% ≈ 32.54%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, with the small discrepancy likely due to rounding in the problem data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the five binary compounds of Gold and Fluorine.**\n\nNow we verify the other clues based on Y being Gold.\n*   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n    Gold indeed has five known binary fluorides: AuF, Au₃F₅, AuF₃, AuF₅, and the dimeric form of gold(V) fluoride, Au₂F₁₀. These are our compounds A1-A5 in some order.\n*   **A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K and oxidizes xenon.**\n    The dimer **Au₂F₁₀** (also written as (AuF₅)₂) fits this description. It is a powerful oxidizing and fluorinating agent, stronger than AuF₅, and is known to be able to oxidize xenon. It is described as dark red. A1 -> A2 + F2 implies A1 has a higher fluorine content or reactivity than A2. Au₂F₁₀ is a good candidate for A1, and AuF₅ for A2. The low decomposition temperature fits the profile of a highly reactive substance. (Though A1 could also be AuF₅ and A2 be AuF₃). However, identifying A1 precisely is not needed to find A4.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Gold).**\n    Fluorination of gold powder with fluorine gas typically produces **AuF₃** or **AuF₅** depending on conditions (temperature and pressure).\n*   **\"A5 can be obtained by adding Y (Au) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.\"**\n    This describes a comproportionation reaction. We are mixing Au (oxidation state 0) with a gold fluoride A4 (oxidation state +n) to get A5 (oxidation state +m, where 0 < m < n). The 1:1 molar ratio is a key clue for the reaction:\n    Au⁰ + AuⁿFₙ → 2 Au^(n/2)F(n/2) (balanced for Gold).\n    Let's check the possible oxidation states of gold fluorides: +1, +5/3 (+1.67), +3, +5.\n    If A4 is **AuF₃** (Gold(III) fluoride), the reaction would be:\n    Au + AuF₃ → ... The product's oxidation state should be between 0 and +3. **AuF** (Gold(I) fluoride) has a gold oxidation state of +1. The balanced reaction is:\n    2Au + AuF₃ → 3AuF\n    This does not match the 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n    Let's try another possibility for A4. What if A4 is a solution of a complex acid? Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is the solvent in which these reactions are often carried out. Gold fluorides react with HF. Specifically, AuF₃ reacts with HF to form fluoroauric acid, **HAuF₄**.\n    *   HAuF₄ is a strong acid and exists in HF solutions. The solution is colorless, which matches the description \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n    *   Let's test the reaction of Au with HAuF₄ in a 1:1 molar ratio:\n        Au + HAuF₄ → ...\n        Here we mix Au(0) with Au(III). Comproportionation could lead to Au(I). Let's try to form a stable Au(I) complex, which could be our substance A5. A plausible reaction in HF is:\n        Au(s) + HAuF₄(solv) + 2HF(solv) → 2HAuF₂(solv)\n        In this reaction, we mix 1 mole of Au with 1 mole of the Au(III) compound (HAuF₄), matching the 1:1 molar ratio described. The product, HAuF₂, is our substance A5. This compound is known and contains Au(I).\n    *   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"** A5 is HAuF₂. Au(I) compounds are prone to disproportionation in water. A likely reaction is:\n        3HAuF₂(aq) → HAuF₄(aq) + 2Au(s) + 2HF(aq)\n        This reaction produces two main substances containing the elements from A5 (gold): fluoroauric acid (HAuF₄) and solid gold (Au). This matches the final clue.\n\nTherefore, the compound A4 is **HAuF₄ (Fluoroauric acid)**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nNow, we calculate the molecular weight of HAuF₄.\nM(HAuF₄) = M(H) + M(Au) + 4 * M(F)\nM(HAuF₄) = 1.008 + 196.97 + 4 * 19.00\nM(HAuF₄) = 1.008 + 196.97 + 76.00\nM(HAuF₄) = 273.978 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Determine the correct range.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is ~274 g/mol. This falls outside the given options A, B, and C.\nA) 160-180\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 220-240\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy. Let's re-examine the core assumption about the reaction for A5.\n\nThe reaction `Au(s) + AuF₃(s) --(heat)--> ?` is a solid-state reaction. The most likely product would be an intermediate fluoride, Au₃F₅ (AuF₂Au₂F₃). However, the prompt says `a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4`. This strongly implies A4 is a species in solution, not a solid binary fluoride. The HAuF₄ hypothesis remains the most chemically sound interpretation of the clues.\n\nCould A4 be something else? Perhaps A4 is AuF₅ itself dissolved in a non-reactive solvent, and the reaction `Au + AuF₅` occurs. This is less likely, as finding a \"colorless\" solvent that dissolves AuF₅ without reacting is difficult, and the reaction products are not straightforward.\n\nLet's assume our identification of Y=Gold is correct and the logic points to A4=HAuF₄. This gives a molar mass of ~274 g/mol. Let's reconsider the options. It's possible there's an error in the question or the options provided. However, let's look for an alternative that might fit an option.\n\nIf A4 were **AuF₃** (molar mass = 196.97 + 3*19 = 253.97 g/mol). This is still outside all ranges except potentially D if there's some leeway.\nIf the reaction was `2Au + AuF₃ -> 3AuF`, A4=AuF₃. MW=254. Still no fit.\n\nIf Y was **Platinum (Pt)** (MW=195.08 g/mol):\nA2=PtF_n with ɷF = 31.96%.\nLet's check n for Pt: 0.3196 = (19n) / (195.08 + 19n) -> 62.33 + 6.07n = 19n -> 62.33 = 12.93n -> n=4.8. So A2=PtF₅?\nLet's check PtF₅: MW=195.08 + 5*19 = 290.08. ɷF = 95/290.08 = 32.75%. This is also a good fit.\nHowever, platinum is not known to form five binary fluorides (typically PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆ are cited). This makes Pt a weaker candidate than Au. If we proceed with Pt, A4 would likely be H₂PtF₆. M(H₂PtF₆) = 2 + 195 + 6*19 = 311 g/mol. This is also outside all options.\n\nGiven the strong chemical evidence pointing towards Y=Au and A4=HAuF₄, and the calculated molecular weight of ~274 g/mol, it appears there may be an error in the provided options. If forced to choose the \"closest\" range without exceeding it, one might be tempted by D, but the number is too high. If the substance A4 was AuF₃ (MW ~254 g/mol), it's also not in any range.\n\nThere must be an interpretation we are missing, or the question's data is flawed. Let's revisit the prompt's data on A2. `ɷF=31.96%`. Our calculation led to M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nWhat if A4 is A2? The problem doesn't forbid it. If A4=A2=AuF₅, then MW=292. No fit.\n\nLet's trust our initial calculation and reasoning. Y=Au, A4=HAuF₄, MW=274 g/mol. The options provided seem incorrect.\nLet's re-read the question carefully. \"Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.\"\n\nLet's hypothesize A4 is **AuF₃** (MW = 253.97 g/mol). Let's see if the reaction can work. `Au + AuF₃ -> ...` in 1:1 ratio. This does not lead to a known stable gold fluoride. So A4 is unlikely to be AuF₃.\n\nThe conclusion remains that A4 is most likely HAuF₄, with a MW of ~274 g/mol. None of the options contains this value. Let's re-examine the options and my calculation.\nH = 1, Au = 197, F = 19. M = 1 + 197 + 4*19 = 198 + 76 = 274. The calculation is correct.\n\nThere is no way to reconcile the chemical evidence with the provided options.\nIf we assume option D is correct (220-240), what substance could it be?\nLet's search for gold fluorides or related species in that range.\n- AuF: 197+19 = 216 g/mol. If A4=AuF, could the reaction `Au + AuF -> ` in a 1:1 ratio make sense? No.\n- HAuF₂ (A5 from our derivation): 1+197+2*19 = 236 g/mol. This is in the range 220-240. But A4 cannot be HAuF₂, as it is the product A5.\n\nThis indicates a probable error in the question, either A4 and A5 are swapped in the description, or the range is for A5, not A4. If the question asked for the MW of A5 (which we identified as HAuF₂), the answer would be ~236 g/mol, falling perfectly into range D.\n\nGiven the context of a multiple-choice question, this type of error is common. The logic identifying A5 as HAuF₂ is sound. The logic identifying A4 as HAuF₄ is also sound. The numbers just don't match the options for A4, but they do for A5. Let's assume the question mistakenly asks for the range for A4 when it meant A5.\nMW(A5) = MW(HAuF₂) ≈ 236 g/mol. This is within the range of 220-240.\n\nHowever, we must answer the question as written. No sound chemical reasoning leads to A4 having a MW in any of the provided ranges, with the most likely candidate (HAuF₄, MW≈274) and the next most likely (AuF₃, MW≈254) both falling outside all options. This implies the question is flawed. Without a valid path to any of the answers, no selection can be made with confidence. But if forced to select the least wrong answer based on a plausible typo: the molecular weight of the *product* A5 (HAuF₂) is ~236 g/mol, which fits in range D. This seems like the intended answer, assuming a typo in the question's target molecule.\n\nThere is no logical path to select D for substance A4. Given the constraint to provide an answer, and the high likelihood of a flawed question, this is an intractable problem. But if a choice must be made, it's a guess based on the question intending to ask for A5. This is a very weak basis for an answer. Let's step back and consider if AuF₃ could be HAuF₄ if some waters of hydration were present, but that complicates things. Let's just go with the most likely scenario, a typo. MW(A5) = 236 g/mol, so the intended answer is likely D. But this is for A5, not A4. Let's mark D with this strong caveat.\n\nLet me try to find a scenario where MW(A4) is in the 220-240 range. The only possibility would be that A4 is A5's precursor from a different reaction, and A5 is something else. But the 1:1 reaction of Au + A4 -> A5 is a very strong clue for comproportionation, and the HAuF₄ -> HAuF₂ pathway is very compelling. The logic seems to much stronger than the provided options.\n\nLet me select the option based on a probable typo in the question, as it's the only way to reach a provided choice.\n- **Identify A5**: HAuF₂, M=236 g/mol.\n- **Identify A4**: HAuF₄, M=274 g/mol.\n- The question asks for the range for A4.\n- The options are A) 160-180, B) 140-160, C) 110-130, D) 220-240.\n- Range D contains the molecular weight of A5.\n- Let's assume the question meant to ask for A5.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a fluorine content (ωF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of this binary fluoride be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 18.998 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = (n * M(F) * (1 - ωF)) / ωF\nM(Y) = (n * 18.998 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45 g/mol\n\nWe can now test integer values for n to find plausible molar masses for Y and check them against the periodic table:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca, 40.08) or Scandium (Sc, 44.96).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.90) or Krypton (Kr, 83.80).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is close to Terbium (Tb, 158.9) or Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5).\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol. This is near Mercury (Hg, 200.6), Thallium (Tl, 204.4) or Lead (Pb, 207.2).\n*   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, common isotopes 239-244) or Americium (Am, 243).\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical fluorine percentage for the most likely candidates:\n*   **KrF2** (n=2, Y=Kr): M(KrF2) = 83.80 + 2*18.998 = 121.8 g/mol. ωF = (38.0/121.8) = 31.2%. This is a reasonable match.\n*   **SbF3** (n=3, Y=Sb): M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*18.998 = 178.75 g/mol. ωF = (57.0/178.75) = 31.89%. This is a very close match.\n*   **PuF6** (n=6, Y=Pu). Using Pu-244 isotope: M(PuF6) = 244 + 6*19 = 358 g/mol. ωF = (114/358) = 31.84%. Using Pu-242 isotope: M(PuF6) = 242.06 + 6*18.998 = 356.05 g/mol. ωF = (113.99/356.05) = 32.01%. This is also an extremely close match.\n\n**Step 2: Use the other chemical properties to identify Y and its fluorides.**\n\nThe problem provides several clues:\n*   A bright-red substance **A1** decomposes at room temperature (293 K) into **A2** and fluorine gas (F2).\n*   **A1** and **A3** are strong oxidizing agents that can react with xenon.\n*   **Y** forms five known binary fluorides.\n\nLet's evaluate our candidates based on these clues:\n*   **Candidate Kr**: Five fluorides of Krypton are not known (only KrF2 is well-established). Also, for A1 to decompose into A2 (KrF2) and F2, A1 must be KrF4. KrF4 is believed to be a colorless solid, not \"bright-red\". So Krypton is unlikely.\n*   **Candidate Sb**: Antimony mainly forms SbF3 and SbF5. The existence of five distinct binary compounds is not well-established. For A1 to decompose to A2 (SbF3) and F2, A1 must be a higher fluoride like SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid and is stable at room temperature, it does not decompose at 293 K. This contradicts the description of A1. So Antimony is unlikely.\n*   **Candidate Pu**: Plutonium is known to form at least five binary fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, Pu2F9). PuF6 is a strong oxidizing agent (reacts with Xe) and is described as a reddish-brown solid which is a plausible match for \"bright-red\". Crucially, PuF6 is thermally unstable and decomposes at room temperature into PuF4 and F2 gas (PuF6 → PuF4 + F2).\n\nThis set of properties provides a strong match for:\n*   **Y = Plutonium (Pu)**\n*   **A1 = Plutonium hexafluoride (PuF6)**\n*   **A2 = Plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4)**\n*   **A3 = PuF6** (it is also a strong oxidizing agent and is formed by fluorinating Pu).\n\nThere is a conflict: The decomposition A1(PuF6) → A2(PuF4) fits perfectly, but the mass percentage given for A2 (31.96%) matches A1(PuF6), not A2(PuF4) which has ωF ≈ 24%. This is likely a common type of error in chemical problems where a property is misattributed. Given that all other chemical facts point strongly to the PuF6/PuF4 identification, we will proceed assuming the mass percentage was meant for A1, not A2.\n\n**Step 3: Identify substance A4.**\n\nWe now need to identify A4 based on the final clue: \"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes the reaction: Pu + A4 → A5 (1:1 mole ratio)\n\nA4 is another binary fluoride of plutonium. The known fluorides are PuF3, PuF4, PuF6. (We also know PuF5 and Pu2F9 exist).\n*   A1 and A3 are PuF6, so A4 is not PuF6.\n*   A2 is PuF4, so A4 is not PuF4.\n*   This leaves **A4 = PuF3**.\n\nLet's check if the reaction makes sense with A4 = PuF3. The problem statement describes adding elemental Pu to a solution of A4. The 1:1 molar ratio suggests a reaction where Pu metal reduces a higher oxidation state fluoride. However, adding Pu(0) to PuF3 (Pu in +3 state) would not involve a simple 1:1 comproportionation to form a stable intermediate fluoride.\nLet's reconsider the wording \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4\". This could describe the preparation of a mixed-valence compound. Indeed, the compound known as Pu2F9 is more accurately represented as [Pu(III)F2]n[Pu(V)F7]n or a similar structure, but it is formed from PuF3 and PuF6.\n\nThere seems to be ambiguity or a simplification in the reaction description. However, following the process of elimination based on identifying A1, A2, and A3, the most logical remaining candidate for A4 is **PuF3**.\n\nThe question is about the solution of A4 being \"colorless\". Plutonium ions are famous for having colored solutions (Pu(III) is blue/violet, Pu(IV) is yellow-brown). A colorless solution is unexpected. This is another significant inconsistency in the problem statement. However, given the options, we must select the most plausible path. Eliminating the already identified fluorides is the most logical step.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nAssuming A4 is PuF3:\n*   Molar mass of Pu (using the most common isotope for calculation, Pu-239): 239.05 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of F: 18.998 g/mol.\n*   Molecular weight of PuF3 = M(Pu) + 3 * M(F) = 239.05 + 3 * 18.998 = 239.05 + 56.994 = **296.044 g/mol**.\n\nUsing the isotope Pu-244 gives M(PuF3) = 244 + 57 = 301 g/mol. Regardless of the isotope, the molecular weight is near 300.\n\nLet's re-examine the question. Perhaps my assignment of A1/A2 is wrong and A4 is something else.\nWhat if A2=SbF3 is correct, and all the properties of A1 are wrong?\nY = Sb, A2=SbF3, A1=SbF5, A3=SbF5. Then A4 could be... there are only two fluorides. A4 and A5 would have to be SbF3 and SbF5.\nIf A4 = SbF5, the reaction is Sb + SbF5 (1:1). Sb(0) + Sb(+5) -> No simple 1:1 product.\nIf A4 = SbF3, the reaction is Sb + SbF3 (1:1). Sb(0) + Sb(+3) -> No simple 1:1 product.\nThe antimony hypothesis leads to dead ends.\n\nLet's return to the most likely, though flawed, Plutonium hypothesis:\nY=Pu, A1=PuF6, A2=PuF4, A3=PuF6.\nThe remaining major fluorides are PuF3 and PuF5. Let's consider A4 could be either.\nMW(PuF3) ≈ 296-301 g/mol.\nMW(PuF5) = 244 + 5*19 = 339 g/mol.\n\nThe provided answer choices are:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 160-180\nD) 220-240\n\nNone of the molecular weights for PuF3 or PuF5 fit into these ranges. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or a severe error in the problem as interpreted.\n\nLet's re-read everything one last time. There must be another interpretation.\nMaybe the element Y is something different, and my initial scan was incomplete. What if the description of A1 being \"bright-red\" and decomposing at RT is the key? This strongly points away from SbF5 and KrF4. It fits PuF6 very well. Let's trust this clue above all others. If A1 is PuF6, then Y=Pu.\nIf Y=Pu, the binary fluorides are PuF3, PuF4, PuF6...\nLet's assume the molecular weights in the options (A,B,C,D) must be correct for A4.\nIf MW(A4) is in range D (220-240), could it be a Pu compound? No. The lightest is PuF3 (~296).\nThis means Y cannot be Pu. This is a total contradiction.\n\nLet's reconsider Sb. Y=Sb. A2=SbF3 (MW ≈ 178.8, %F=31.89%).\nLet's assume the descriptions of A1 are wrong, but A2=SbF3 is correct because the math is the tightest fit.\nA1 would be SbF5. A3 would be SbF5. A4 would have to be either SbF3 or SbF5.\nMW(SbF3) = 178.8 g/mol. This falls in range C (160-180).\nMW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5*19 = 216.76 g/mol.\nThe reaction Sb + A4 -> A5 (1:1). Still problematic.\n\nWhat about Chlorine? ClF, ClF3, ClF5. Only 3 fluorides.\nA2=ClF_n, %F=31.96.\nLet's check: %F in ClF3 = (3*19)/(35.5+57) = 57/92.5 = 61.6%. No.\nWhat about Bromine again? Y=Br, A2 = ???. The %F doesn't match any stable fluoride.\n\nLet's go back to Sb. Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. MW(A2)=178.8. Let's assume A1=SbF5 despite the wrong color and stability. Let A4 be SbF5. MW(SbF5)=216.76. Doesn't fit the ranges well. Let A4 be SbF3. MW=178.8, fits range C.\nLet's test this scenario: **A4 = SbF3**.\nThe reaction is: Sb + SbF3 (in 1:1 ratio) -> A5.\nThis reaction doesn't seem to lead to a known antimony fluoride, A5.\nThe puzzle is deeply flawed. However, in such contest problems, sometimes one must choose the \"least wrong\" path. The match between SbF3 and the mass percentage for A2 is numerically excellent (31.89% vs 31.96%).\nLet's assume:\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A2 = SbF3 (from mass%)\n*   A1 = SbF5 (highest fluoride, strong oxidizer/superacid reacts with Xe) -> ignore color/stability problems.\n*   A3 = SbF5 (same logic)\n*   The known fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5. Let's assume others like SbF4 exist to meet the \"five fluorides\" criteria.\n*   A4 and A5 are SbF3 and SbF5.\n*   \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". SbF5 is a liquid, SbF3 is a solid. It could be a solution of SbF3 in liquid SbF5 or another solvent. Both SbF3 and SbF5 are colorless.\n*   If **A4 = SbF5**, MW=216.8 g/mol. Closest range is D (220-240). Let's check reaction: Sb + SbF5 -> A5 (1:1). Comproportionation could lead to SbF3. Let's balance: 2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3. The ratio is not 1:1.\n*   If **A4 = SbF3**, MW=178.8 g/mol. This falls squarely in range **C (160-180)**. Let's check reaction: Sb + SbF3 -> A5 (1:1). Not a standard reaction.\n\nLet's try one final radical idea. Let's re-read this: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" What if A4 is Y itself dissolved in something, and A5 is the fluoride? This is not how the sentence is structured. A4 is clearly a distinct substance from Y.\n\nGiven the irreconcilable contradictions in the Plutonium path (molecular weight ranges) and the chemical reaction problems in the Antimony path, let's focus only on the molecular weights. The calculation for A2 yielded SbF3 as a very strong candidate. The MW of SbF3 is 178.8. If we assume A4 is SbF3, it fits range C. The MW of SbF5 is 216.8. If A4 is SbF5, it is closest to range D. The description of A4 having a \"colorless concentrated solution\" might favor the liquid SbF5 over the solid SbF3. If A4 = SbF5, its molecular weight is 216.8 g/mol. This is close to the range 220-240.\n\nHowever, let's revisit the prompt with another element: Rhenium (Re). M=186.2 g/mol. Known fluorides: ReF4, ReF5, ReF6, ReF7.\nA2 = ReF_n, %F=31.96. If n=4, M(Y) = 161.8 (No). If n=5, M(Y) = 202.25 (No).\nIf we test ReF6: %F = (6*19)/(186.2 + 114) = 114/300.2 = 38%. No.\n\nLet's go back to Y=Sb and A2=SbF3. MW(SbF3) = 178.8 (in range C). A4=SbF3 is a possibility.\nLet's try Y=Sb and A2=SbF5? %F in SbF5 = (5*19)/(121.8+95) = 95/216.8 = 43.8%. No.\n\nThe most consistent numerical data point is A2=SbF3. If we assume one of the other fluorides must be A4, the only other common option is SbF5 (MW=216.8 g/mol). This falls just outside range D, but is closest to it. What if we are looking for the MW of A3? No, it asks for A4.\n\nLet's assume A4=SbF5 and there's some slight inaccuracy in the provided ranges. MW=216.8 is closest to D.\n\nBut there is another possibility. Let's check what A5 might be. What if Y+A4=A5 means Pu + PuF6 -> PuF4 + PuF3 ... this is getting too speculative.\n\nLet's retry Y=Au (Gold), M=197. n=5, M(Y)=202. %F in AuF5 = 32.5%. Close-ish.\nA1=AuF7? (red solid, unstable) decomposes to AuF5+F2. A2=AuF5. %F=32.5% is close to 31.96%. Five fluorides not known. A1(AuF7) oxidizes Xe. This is a plausible path.\nY=Au. A1=AuF7. A2=AuF5. A3=AuF7.\nA4 must be another gold fluoride. AuF3 is known. MW(AuF3)=197 + 3*19 = 254. This is not in any range.\n\nGiven the severe inconsistencies, let's reconsider Y=Sb. A2=SbF3. A4 is likely SbF5 or SbF3. MW(SbF3) = 178.8 (Range C). MW(SbF5)=216.8 (Closest to D). Let's think about the last sentence. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\nIf Y=Sb, A4=SbF5, the reaction with Sb to give A5 is unclear. But let's check the hydrolysis of antimony fluorides. SbF5 + 2H2O -> SbO2F + 4HF. (Two substances). SbF3 + H2O -> SbOF + 2HF (Two substances). So this doesn't help distinguish.\n\nLet's assume A4 = SbF5 (as a liquid, it can be a \"concentrated solution\" of itself). MW=216.8 g/mol.\nThe range 220-240 is very close. This is a plausible, though not perfect, choice.\n\nFinal Check: Let's assume A4 falls in range B (140-160).\nCould A4 be TeF6? M(TeF6) = 127.6 + 6*19 = 241.6. No.\nCould A4 be MoF6? M(MoF6) = 96 + 114 = 210. No.\nWhat compound could have MW 140-160? BrF5 = 175 (No). IF3=184 (No).\nThe element Y must be heavy for its fluorides to reach these molecular weights. The Y=Sb path seems the most likely intended solution despite its flaws. And if so, A4 is likely SbF5 (the other major fluoride), placing its molecular weight near range D.\n\nLet's reconsider the ranges and my calculation for SbF5. M(SbF5)=216.76. Range D is 220-240. The difference is 3.24. This is a small discrepancy. Let's assume this is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YF_n) with a fluorine weight percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can establish a relationship between the molar mass of Y (M_Y) and the number of fluorine atoms (n).\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 18.9984 g/mol.\n    The formula for weight percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    0.3196 = (n * 18.9984) / (M_Y + n * 18.9984)\n    By rearranging the formula, we can solve for M_Y:\n    M_Y = (n * 18.9984 / 0.3196) - (n * 18.9984)\n    M_Y = (59.444 * n) - (18.9984 * n)\n    M_Y ≈ 40.446 * n\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer n (a plausible oxidation state) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to K, Ca)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Br)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.3 g/mol (Very close to Antimony, Sb, with M = 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Close to Dy)\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.2 g/mol (Between Au and Tl/Pb)\n    *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Close to Pu, Am)\n\n    Let's verify the fluorine percentage for the most likely candidate, Antimony (Sb) with n=3.\n    A2 would be SbF3.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 18.9984) / (121.760 + 3 * 18.9984) * 100%\n    ɷF(SbF3) = 56.9952 / 178.7552 * 100% = 31.88%\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a relative difference of only 0.25%. This is the best fit among all plausible elements. So we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compounds A1 and A3.**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (room temperature) into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine (F2). The reaction is `A1 -> SbF3 + F2`. For this reaction to be balanced, A1 must have a higher fluorine-to-antimony ratio than SbF3. The most common and stable higher fluoride of antimony is SbF5. So, the reaction would be `SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2`. This makes **A1 = SbF5**.\n    *   There are some inconsistencies: SbF5 is a colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid, and its decomposition to SbF3 requires high temperatures (~400 °C), not 293 K. These are likely inaccuracies in the problem statement, which is common in complex chemistry puzzles.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. SbF5 is a very strong oxidizing agent and Lewis acid, known to react with xenon (e.g., `XeF2 + 2SbF5 -> [XeF][Sb2F11]`). This property strongly supports A1 being SbF5.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Sb) and also interacts with xenon. This also points to the strongest oxidizing agent, so **A3 = SbF5**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5.**\n    *   The problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   Here, Y = Sb. So the reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5` with `n(Sb) : n(A4) = 1:1`.\n    *   A4 is a binary fluoride of antimony. The two main candidates are SbF3 and SbF5.\n    *   This type of reaction, involving an element and its compound to form a compound of intermediate oxidation state, is a comproportionation. Let's analyze the possibilities.\n        *   If A4 = SbF5, the reaction would be `2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3`. This is a known reaction, but the molar ratio of reactants is `Sb : SbF5 = 2:3`, which is not the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n        *   If A4 = SbF3, the reaction is `Sb + SbF3 -> A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio. This fits the stoichiometry perfectly. A5 would be a subfluoride like `Sb2F3` or more simply represented as `SbF`.\n    *   Let's check other properties. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". If **A4 = SbF3**, it is a colorless (or white) solid and is soluble in solvents like HF, so a colorless solution is plausible.\n    *   The final clue is that A5 decomposes in water into two substances. A subfluoride like SbF (antimony in +1 oxidation state) would be unstable in water and would disproportionate into elemental antimony (Sb, oxidation state 0) and an antimony(III) compound (e.g., Sb2O3 or SbF3). This fits the description.\n    *   Therefore, the most consistent identification is **A4 = SbF3**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    We have identified A4 as antimony trifluoride (SbF3). Let's calculate its molecular weight.\n    M_Y = M_Sb = 121.76 g/mol\n    M_F = 18.998 g/mol\n    MW(A4) = MW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 ≈ 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol. We check which of the given ranges contains this value.\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 110-130\n    The value 178.76 falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown element Y and the compounds A1 through A5.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    Let the formula of the binary compound A2 be YF_n.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    We are given ɷF = 31.96% = 0.3196. The molar mass of Fluorine, M(F), is approximately 18.998 g/mol.\n    0.3196 = (n * 18.998) / (M(Y) + n * 18.998)\n    Rearranging for the molar mass of element Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 18.998 = n * 18.998\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 18.998 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 18.998 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (18.998 * 0.6804 / 0.3196)\n    M(Y) ≈ n * 40.4 g/mol\n\n    Now we can test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms):\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.4 g/mol. This corresponds to Calcium (Ca) or Argon (Ar). These elements do not fit the described chemistry (e.g., forming five fluorides, powerful oxidizing agents).\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.8 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol) and Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.2 g/mol. This is close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.4 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu-242 isotope).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates for Y based on other clues.**\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** If A2 = SbF₃, the calculated ɷF is (3*19)/(121.8+57) = 31.88%. This is a very close match. However, Sb only forms two well-known binary fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. Also, its fluorides are colorless, but A1 is described as \"bright-red\".\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** If A2 = PuF₆ (with  Pu-242 isotope, M=242.05), the calculated ɷF is (6*19)/(242.05+114) = 32.01%. This is an excellent match. The problem is the decomposition \"A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine\". This means A1 has a higher fluorine content than A2. If A2=PuF₆, A1 would need to be PuFₙ with n>6, which is unknown and highly unlikely.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Let's check this candidate. If Y=Kr, then A2 is likely KrF₂.\n        Let's calculate the mass percentage of F in KrF₂: M(Kr) = 83.8 g/mol.\n        ɷF(KrF₂) = (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 = 0.3120 = 31.20%.\n        This value is reasonably close to the given 31.96% (a relative difference of about 2.4%). Given the complexities, this might be an acceptable discrepancy.\n\n3.  **Test the Krypton (Y=Kr) hypothesis with all the given information.**\n    *   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" This is a known inconsistency in this classic problem. Krypton mainly forms KrF₂ and the highly unstable KrF₄. We will assume this is an inaccuracy in the problem statement.\n    *   \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine.\" If A2=KrF₂, the decomposition A1 → A2 + F₂ suggests A1 = KrF₄. KrF₄ is known to be unstable and decompose into KrF₂ and F₂. However, KrF₄ is a white solid, not \"bright-red\". This is another known inaccuracy in this problem.\n    *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" KrF₄ is an exceptionally strong oxidizing agent, much stronger than XeF₄, and can oxidize Xenon. This fits.\n    *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\" Direct fluorination of Krypton gives Krypton difluoride (Kr + F₂ → KrF₂). So, A3 = KrF₂.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" KrF₂ is a strong fluorinating agent and can react with other substances, which can in turn react with Xenon. For example, it reacts with Lewis acids like SbF₅ to form salts like [KrF]⁺[SbF₆]⁻, which are powerful xenon oxidizers. This fits.\n\n4.  **Identify substance A4.**\n    So far, the hypothesis Y=Kr seems the most plausible despite inaccuracies in the description.\n    A1=KrF₄, A2=KrF₂, A3=KrF₂, Y=Kr.\n    The final piece of information is: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    This translates to: Kr(g) + A4(solution) → A5.\n    A4 must be a substance that can react with elemental Krypton in a 1:1 ratio. Since Krypton is very unreactive, A4 must be a very powerful oxidizing agent itself and likely a strong Lewis acid. The solution is colorless. We are looking for the molecular weight of A4.\n    Let's examine the options for the molecular weight of A4.\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 110-130\n\n    We need a colorless substance that is a powerful oxidizer, likely a fluoride, with a molecular weight in one of these ranges.\n    Let's check for suitable compounds in range A (160-180 g/mol):\n    *   **XeF₂ (Xenon difluoride):** Molar mass = 131.29 + 2 * 18.998 = 169.29 g/mol. This falls perfectly within the range [160-180]. XeF₂ is a colorless solid that forms colorless solutions in anhydrous HF.\n    *   **AsF₅ (Arsenic pentafluoride):** Molar mass = 74.92 + 5 * 18.998 = 169.91 g/mol. This also falls perfectly within the range. It is a colorless gas but can be used in solution (e.g., in HF).\n\n    Both XeF₂ and AsF₅ are powerful oxidizing agents/Lewis acids and have molecular weights fitting the range A. While the reaction Kr + XeF₂ → KrXeF₂ is speculative, it provides a logical path to the answer. The problem is constructed such that these considerations lead to a specific answer range.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The chain of deduction, despite some inconsistencies in the problem's descriptive text (color, number of compounds), strongly points towards Y=Krypton. This identification then allows us to identify plausible candidates for substance A4 (such as XeF₂ or AsF₅), whose molecular weights (≈169 g/mol) fall squarely into the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nBased on the chemical information and calculations, we can deduce the identities of the compounds and answer the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Compound A2**: We are given that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), and the mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) is 31.96%.\n    *   Let the atomic mass of Y be M_Y and the atomic mass of fluorine be M_F (≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n    *   Let the chemical formula of A2 be YF_n.\n    *   The formula for mass percentage is: `ωF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)`\n    *   Substituting the values: `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + 19.00n)`\n    *   Rearranging to solve for M_Y: `M_Y = (19.00n / 0.3196) - 19.00n` which simplifies to `M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n`.\n    *   We test integer values for `n`:\n        *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 (Ca, Ar - unlikely)\n        *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 (Se, Br - possible)\n        *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35. This value is extremely close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   Let's verify this by calculating the mass percentage of fluorine in SbF3:\n        *   Molar mass of SbF3 = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n        *   ωF = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    *   This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y = Sb (Antimony)** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A4**: The problem states that A4 is one of five binary compounds of Antimony and Fluorine. The most common antimony fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5.\n\n3.  **Calculate Molecular Weights**: Let's calculate the molecular weights (MW) of the two most likely candidates for A4.\n    *   **MW of SbF3**: 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = **178.754 g/mol**\n    *   **MW of SbF5**: 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = **216.75 g/mol**\n\n4.  **Match with Given Options**: Now, we compare these molecular weights to the ranges provided in the options:\n    *   A) 220-240\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 160-180\n\n    The calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.754 g/mol) fits perfectly within the range **D) 160-180**. The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.75 g/mol) does not fit any of the ranges provided.\n\nTherefore, compound A4 must be SbF3. The question asks for the range in which its molecular weight falls.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and Fluorine (F), with a formula YFₙ. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and 'n' is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\n    Let's rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (19.00 × n) / (M(Y) + 19.00 × n)\n    0.3196 × (M(Y) + 19n) = 19n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 12.9276n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    Now we test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass M(Y):\n    *   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to Calcium, Ca)\n    *   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (Close to Bromine, Br)\n    *   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Close to Antimony, Sb, with M = 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (Close to Dysprosium, Dy)\n    *   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Close to Mercury, Hg, or Gold, Au)\n    *   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.70 g/mol (Close to Plutonium, Pu, or Americium, Am)\n\n    Antimony (Sb) for n=3 is a very strong candidate. Let's check the mass percentage in SbF₃ more accurately. Antimony has two major isotopes: ¹²¹Sb (mass 120.90 u) and ¹²³Sb (mass 122.90 u). Let's calculate the fluorine percentage using the lighter isotope ¹²¹Sb, which might be used in a specific synthesis.\n    A2 = ¹²¹SbF₃\n    M(¹²¹SbF₃) = 120.90 + 3 × 19.00 = 177.90 g/mol\n    ɷF = (3 × 19.00) / 177.90 = 57 / 177.90 ≈ 0.3204 = 32.04%\n    This value (32.04%) is extremely close to the given 31.96%. The small difference can be attributed to rounding or the use of slightly different atomic mass values. This confirms with high probability that Y = Antimony (Sb) and A2 = SbF₃.\n\n2.  **Identify the other substances based on Y = Sb.**\n    *   **Y = Sb**\n    *   **A2 = SbF₃** (Antimony(III) fluoride)\n    *   **A1**: The problem states `A1 → A2 + F₂`. This means A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony that decomposes into SbF₃ and fluorine. The next stable higher fluoride is SbF₅.\n        So, **A1 = SbF₅** (Antimony(V) fluoride).\n    *   **Check other clues**:\n        *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon\": SbF₅ is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and a component of fluoroantimonic acid, which is known to react with and oxidize xenon. This fits.\n        *   \"A1 is a bright-red substance\": SbF₅ is actually a colorless viscous liquid. This is a known inconsistency in this classic problem, likely an error in the problem statement intended to mislead. Given the strong numerical evidence for Sb, we proceed by noting this discrepancy.\n        *   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with Y\": Antimony is only known to form two stable binary fluorides, SbF₃ and SbF₅. This is another likely error in the problem statement.\n    *   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" The highest fluoride is formed by direct fluorination, and it's the strongest oxidizing agent.\n        So, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and determine its molecular weight.**\n    *   The problem asks for the molecular weight range of **A4**. A4 must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony. The choices are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   Let's calculate their molecular weights using the standard atomic weight of Sb (121.76 g/mol):\n        *   **MW(SbF₃)** = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 121.76 + 57 = **178.76 g/mol**\n        *   **MW(SbF₅)** = 121.76 + 5 × 19.00 = 121.76 + 95 = **216.76 g/mol**\n    *   Now, let's look at the given options for the molecular weight range:\n        A) 110-130\n        B) 140-160\n        C) 160-180\n        D) 220-240\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely within the range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the ranges. It is close to range D, but outside of it.\n    *   This strongly implies that **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n4.  **Final check of the remaining chemical reaction.**\n    The last piece of information is: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 (SbF₃), A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n    *   This describes the reaction of antimony metal with antimony(III) fluoride to form a sub-fluoride (a compound where Sb has an oxidation state between 0 and +3). Such sub-halides are known to be unstable and to disproportionate in water. For instance, a hypothetical `Sb₂F₃` (formed from `Sb + SbF₃`) would react with water to disproportionate into elemental antimony (Sb⁰) and an antimony(III) compound (like Sb₂O₃ or Sb(OH)₃), which could be the \"two substances\" mentioned (or a solid mixture and an aqueous solution). This description is chemically plausible for A4 being SbF₃.\n\nConclusion: Based on the strong numerical evidence from the mass percentage and the process of elimination using the provided molecular weight ranges, A4 is SbF₃. Its molecular weight is approximately 178.8 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (let's call it YF_n_), and its mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    where M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M_Y is the molar mass of element Y.\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\n    0.3196 = (19n) / (M_Y + 19n)\n    0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 19n - 6.0724n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 12.9276n\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find plausible molar masses for Y.\n    *   n = 1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (matches Sc, K, Ca, Ar - not ideal candidates for the described chemistry).\n    *   n = 2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (matches Br, Se - bromine forms BrF3, BrF5, but %F don't match).\n    *   n = 3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n = 4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (matches Dy).\n    *   n = 6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (matches Pu).\n\n    Let's check the fluorine percentage for SbF3:\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    %F = (3 * 19.00 / 178.76) * 100 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n    So, it is highly likely that **Y = Sb (Antimony)** and **A2 = SbF3 (Antimony trifluoride)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A3.**\n    A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and it can interact with xenon. Antimony reacts with excess fluorine to form antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). SbF5 is a powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent known to react with xenon (e.g., `Xe + 2SbF5 → [XeF]+[Sb2F11]-`).\n    Therefore, **A3 = SbF5**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5.**\n    We are told that adding Y (Sb) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio produces A5. A4 must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony. The two common ones are SbF3 and SbF5. Both form colorless solutions. Let's analyze both possibilities for A4.\n\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = SbF5**. The reaction would be `Sb + SbF5 → A5`. This is a well-known comproportionation reaction to produce SbF3. The balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3`. Here, A5 would be SbF3. The problem states that A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. SbF3 hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF) (`SbF3 + H2O → SbOF + 2HF`), which perfectly fits the \"two substances\" description.\n        *   **Problem:** The stoichiometry of the reaction is 2:3, not 1:1 as stated in the problem. Also, let's calculate the molecular weight of A4=SbF5: M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fit into any of the provided answer ranges.\n\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = SbF3**.\n        Let's calculate the molecular weight of A4=SbF3: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        This value, 178.76 g/mol, falls squarely into the range **B) 160-180**. This provides a direct link to one of the answers.\n        *   **Problem:** The reaction `Sb + SbF3 → A5` is chemically unusual, as Sb(0) cannot readily react with Sb(III) in this manner. Furthermore, the likely product (a subfluoride like Sb2F3) would disproportionate in water to give at least three products (e.g., Sb, SbOF, HF), which contradicts the \"two substances\" clue.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    We face a contradiction.\n    *   The path where A4 = SbF5 has more consistent chemistry (reaction mechanism, decomposition of product) but is contradicted by both the stoichiometry and the molecular weight ranges in the answers.\n    *   The path where A4 = SbF3 is chemically problematic but leads to a molecular weight that perfectly matches one of the answer ranges.\n\n    In chemistry puzzles of this nature, it is common for some of the descriptive text (like stoichiometry or qualitative descriptions of reactions) to be simplified or even slightly inaccurate, while the numerical data (mass percentages, molecular weight ranges) are intended to be precise guides to the solution. The fact that M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol fits perfectly in the 160-180 g/mol range is a very strong indication that this is the intended answer. Therefore, we conclude that **A4 is SbF3**.\n\n    The molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is ~178.76 g/mol. This value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is my reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using substance A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote it as YFx) and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    where M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (19.00 * x) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * x)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * x = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n    Here, 'x' is the number of fluorine atoms in A2, which must be a positive integer corresponding to an oxidation state of Y. I will systematically check integer values for 'x' to find a plausible element Y.\n\n2.  **Test potential values of 'x' to find Y:**\n    *   If x=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest is Calcium, Ca=40.08 g/mol, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If x=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Closest is Bromine, Br=79.9 g/mol, but it's a halogen itself).\n    *   If x=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Closest is Antimony, Sb=121.76 g/mol). Let's check this. If A2 is SbF3, its ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   If x=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Closest are Terbium/Dysprosium, but their chemistry is unsuitable).\n    *   If x=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Closest are Gold/Mercury, but the mass percentage match is poorer. For AuF5, ɷF ≈ 32.5%; for HgF5, not a known stable compound).\n    *   If x=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Closest is Plutonium, Pu=244 g/mol). ɷF for PuF6 ≈ 31.84%. This is also a good match.\n\n3.  **Evaluate candidates based on chemical properties:**\n    *   **Candidate Y=Sb**:\n        *   A2 = SbF3. (Matches ɷF).\n        *   A1 decomposes to A2(SbF3) + F2. So A1 would be a higher fluoride, i.e., SbF5. The reaction would be SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2.\n        *   However, A1 is described as a \"bright-red substance\". SbF5 is a colorless liquid/solid. This is a direct contradiction. So, Sb is likely not the element.\n\n    *   **Candidate Y=Pu**:\n        *   Let's check the clues against Plutonium (Pu).\n        *   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\". Plutonium forms at least three well-known binary fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF6). While \"five\" might be specific to the problem's source, the existence of multiple stable fluorides fits.\n        *   A1 is a bright-red substance. PuF6 is described as a volatile reddish-brown solid. This is a plausible match for \"bright-red\".\n        *   A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. The reaction would be A1 -> A2 + F2, meaning A1 is a higher fluoride than A2. The known decomposition of PuF6 is: PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2. This decomposition occurs spontaneously at room temperature (293 K). This perfectly matches the description.\n        *   Therefore: **A1 = PuF6** and **A2 = PuF4**.\n        *   Let's verify the mass percentage for A2=PuF4: ɷF = (4 * 19.00) / (244 + 4 * 19.00) = 76 / 320 = 23.75%. This does **not** match the given 31.96%.\n    *   This leads to a contradiction. It appears there is an inconsistency in the problem statement itself, as the chemical properties (colors, reactions) and the quantitative data (mass %) point to different identities for Y, A1, and A2.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluation and The Most Likely Path:**\n    There is a significant conflict in the provided information. However, often in such problems, the quantitative data (the mass percentage) is the most reliable clue. Let's follow the lead from our calculation: `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x`. The match for Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 (x=3) is exceptionally good (calculated 31.88% vs. given 31.96%). It's possible the description of A1's color is an error or refers to a specific, perhaps impure, state. Let's proceed assuming **Y=Sb** despite the color discrepancy.\n\n    *   **Y = Sb (Antimony)**\n    *   **A2 = SbF3 (Antimony trifluoride)**\n    *   **A1 = SbF5 (Antimony pentafluoride)**, decomposes into A2 and F2 (ignoring the color mismatch).\n    *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon\". SbF5 is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and fluorinating agent. It reacts with xenon to form compounds like [XeF][SbF6], thus oxidizing xenon. This fits.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon\". A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) with fluorine. Sb + F2 -> SbF3 or SbF5. If we need a strong oxidizer, **A3 = SbF5**. This fits.\n    *   Now, the final part: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n    *   This describes the preparation of Antimony oxychloride. Antimony (Sb) dissolves in a hot concentrated solution of Antimony(III) chloride (SbCl3). This must be A4.\n        Reaction: **Sb + SbCl3 -> intermediate species**. However, the classic synthesis of A5 (see below) is adding water to A4.\n    *   Let's reconsider the wording. A more direct reaction that makes sense is the hydrolysis of A4. **A4 is Antimony trichloride, SbCl3.**\n    *   Adding water to a solution of SbCl3 (A4) causes hydrolysis to form antimony oxychloride (SbOCl) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n        Reaction: **SbCl3 (A4) + H2O -> SbOCl (A5) + 2 HCl**\n    *   This A5, Antimony oxychloride (also known as \"algargot powder\"), is a white powder that fits the description of \"A5 decomposing in water to form two substances\" (it forms from water, and its equilibrium involves SbCl3 and Sb2O3/HCl). The description might be slightly imprecise. Let's assume A5 is SbOCl. The \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4\" part is confusing and may be flawed in the problem statement, but SbCl3 is the most logical candidate for A4 in the context of antimony chemistry.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on our deduction, **A4 is Antimony trichloride (SbCl3)**.\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(SbCl3) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(Cl)\n    M(SbCl3) ≈ 121.76 + 3 * 35.453\n    M(SbCl3) ≈ 121.76 + 106.359\n    M(SbCl3) ≈ 228.12 g/mol\n\n6.  **Match with the given range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 228.12 g/mol. This falls squarely within the range given in option B.\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 140-160\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step chemical deduction to identify the unknown substances.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    *   The problem provides the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2 as 31.96% (0.3196). Let the chemical formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is: ɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n    *   Using the atomic weight of fluorine, Ar(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol, we can solve for the atomic weight of Y, Ar(Y):\n        0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (Ar(Y) + n × 19.00)\n        0.3196 × Ar(Y) + 0.3196 × (19.00n) = 19.00n\n        0.3196 × Ar(Y) = 19.00n - 6.0724n\n        0.3196 × Ar(Y) = 12.9276n\n        Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n    *   We can test integer values for n (which represents the oxidation state of Y):\n        *   n=1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (This corresponds to Calcium, Ca)\n        *   n=2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (This corresponds to Bromine, Br, or Selenium, Se)\n        *   n=3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (This is very close to the atomic weight of Antimony, Sb, which is 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   Antimony (Sb) is a plausible candidate. Let's verify the mass fraction for SbF₃.\n        MW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n        ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 × 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is an excellent match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   Therefore, element **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and compound **A2 is Antimony(III) fluoride (SbF₃)**.\n\n2.  **Identify A1 and A3:**\n    *   Substance A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony. The reaction is A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. The most stable higher fluoride is Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF₅. So, **A1 = SbF₅**.\n    *   The fact that A1 oxidizes xenon further supports its identity as SbF₅, a very powerful oxidizing agent.\n    *   Substance A3 is also formed by fluorinating antimony and also oxidizes xenon, which means **A3 is also SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4:**\n    *   Now we need to identify A4. It is one of the five binary compounds of fluorine and antimony. The most common are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   The problem describes a reaction to form A5: Y(Sb) + A4 → A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution.\" Both SbF₃ and SbF₅ are colorless solids that can form solutions.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the possible candidates for A4 and compare them with the given ranges.\n        *   If A4 = SbF₅, MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 × 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n        *   If A4 = SbF₃, MW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    *   Let's look at the given ranges:\n        A) 110-130\n        B) 220-240 (SbF₅ is close but not within this range)\n        C) 160-180\n        D) 140-160\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.754 g/mol) falls perfectly into the range **160-180**. This strongly suggests that A4 is SbF₃.\n\n4.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    *   If A4 is SbF₃, the reaction is Sb + SbF₃ → A5. The product A5 would be an antimony subfluoride or a compound with antimony in a mixed oxidation state. Such a compound would be unstable in water, decomposing into two substances (elemental Sb and an Sb³⁺ compound), which matches the final clue.\n    *   Therefore, compound A4 is SbF₃, and its molecular weight is 178.754 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is my reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   Element Y forms five binary fluorides. Let's call them YFx.\n    *   A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 are five substances related to Y and fluorine. They are strongly implied to be the five binary fluorides.\n    *   A1 (bright-red) decomposes at 293 K into A2 and F2. Reaction: `A1 -> A2 + F2`. This means the oxidation state of Y in A1 is higher than in A2.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96% (0.3196).\n    *   A1 and A3 are strong oxidizing agents, capable of reacting with Xenon.\n    *   A3 is synthesized by `Y + F2 -> A3`.\n    *   A5 is formed from A4 via the reaction: `Y + A4 -> A5` (in solution, 1:1 molar ratio). This must be a reduction of A4 by element Y.\n    *   A5 decomposes in water to form two other substances (hydrolysis).\n    *   The goal is to find the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n2.  **Identify Element Y using the Mass Percentage:**\n    *   The formula for A2 is YFx.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine is given by: `ɷF = (x * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + x * Ar(F))`.\n    *   Rearranging for the atomic weight of Y: `Ar(Y) = x * Ar(F) * (1 - ɷF) / ɷF`.\n    *   Using Ar(F) ≈ 19 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196:\n        `Ar(Y) ≈ x * 19 * (1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196`\n        `Ar(Y) ≈ x * 40.45`\n    *   I will now test integer values of `x` (the number of fluorine atoms) and see if the calculated `Ar(Y)` matches any real elements known to form multiple fluorides.\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    w_F_A2 = 0.3196\n    Ar_F = 18.9984\n\n    # A dictionary of elements and their atomic weights known to form multiple fluorides\n    elements = {\n        'Sb': 121.760, 'Pu': 244.0, 'Dy': 162.50, 'Tb': 158.93,\n        'Se': 78.96, 'Ge': 72.63, 'Sn': 118.71, 'Pb': 207.2,\n        'Re': 186.21, 'Pt': 195.08\n    }\n\n    print(\"Theoretical Ar(Y) for A2 = YFx:\")\n    # Calculate Ar(Y) for different values of x\n    for x in range(1, 8):\n        Ar_Y_calc = x * Ar_F * (1 - w_F_A2) / w_F_A2\n        print(f\"For x={x}, theoretical Ar(Y) = {Ar_Y_calc:.2f}\")\n        # Check for matches\n        for name, real_ar in elements.items():\n            if abs(Ar_Y_calc - real_ar) < 2.0: # Check for close matches\n                 # Now, let's calculate the wF for the actual element fluoride and see how close it is\n                 wF_real = (x * Ar_F) / (real_ar + x * Ar_F)\n                 print(f\"  -> Match candidate: {name} (Ar={real_ar}).

This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\n        *   wF(SbF3) = (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 57) ≈ 31.88%. Very close to 31.96%.\n    *   For x=4, theoretical Ar(Y) ≈ 161.63.

Close as well.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidates based on the Reaction Stoichiometry:**\n    The crucial clue is the reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` in a **1:1 molar ratio**. This is a comproportionation reaction. For a 1:1 ratio between the element `Y` and the compound `A4`, the reaction must be of the form:\n    `Y + YF(2m) -> 2YFm`\n    This requires element `Y` to have stable fluorides in oxidation states `+m` and `+2m`.\n    Let's check our candidates:\n    *   **Sb:** Forms SbF3 (+3) and SbF5 (+5). The oxidation states are not in a `m` and `2m` relationship. So, this path is invalid.\n    *   **Pu:** Forms PuF3 (+3) and PuF6 (+6). The oxidation states `+3` and `+6` are in a `m=3`, `2m=6` relationship. The reaction would be `Pu + PuF6 -> 2PuF3`.\n        *   This identifies A4=PuF6 and A5=PuF3.\n        *   The problem also gives that A2 has wF=31.96%. Our analysis shows A2 is likely PuF6. So A4=A2. This is consistent.\n        *   However, if A4=PuF6, its molecular weight is `244 + 6*19 = 358` g/mol. This value is not in any of the provided ranges (A-D). This means Y cannot be Pu.\n    *   **Dy:** Forms DyF2 (+2), DyF3 (+3), and DyF4 (+4). The oxidation states `+2` and `+4` are in a `m=2`, `2m=4` relationship. The reaction would be `Dy + DyF4 -> 2DyF2`.\n        *   This fits the 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly.\n        *   This identifies **A4 = DyF4** and A5 = DyF2.\n        *   The problem also gives that A2 has wF=31.96%. Our calculation for DyF4 gives wF=31.87%, which is an excellent match. So, `A2 = A4 = DyF4`. This is perfectly consistent.\n\n4.  **Final Verification and Calculation:**\n    *   Let's assume **Y=Dysprosium (Dy)** and check all the facts.\n    *   `A2 = DyF4`. Mass % matches.\n    *   `A4 = DyF4`. The `Y+A4->A5` reaction is `Dy + DyF4 -> 2DyF2`. Fits perfectly.\n    *   `A5 = DyF2`. `A5` decomposing in water is plausible (`DyF2 + 2H2O -> Dy(OH)2 + 2HF`).\n    *   `A1 -> A2 + F2` becomes `A1 -> DyF4 + F2`. This implies `A1` is a higher fluoride like `DyF5` or `DyF6`. While these are not common, `Dy(IV)` is a known state, so this is chemically plausible within the context of a challenging problem. The color description (\"bright-red\") must be taken as a given property of this specific (possibly hypothetical) substance A1.\n    *   The problem asks for the molecular weight range of **A4**. We have confidently identified A4 as DyF4.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of DyF4.\n        *   Ar(Dy) = 162.50 g/mol\n        *   Ar(F) = 18.998 g/mol\n        *   Mr(DyF4) = Ar(Dy) + 4 * Ar(F) = 162.50 + 4 * 18.998 = 162.50 + 75.992 = **238.492 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (DyF4) is 238.492 g/mol.

    "This problem requires a multi-step deduction to identify the unknown substances. The most consistent approach involves prioritizing the quantitative data provided, as qualitative descriptions in such problems can sometimes be simplified or contain inaccuracies.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\nLet the chemical formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. We are given that the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96%.\nThe formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\nUsing M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196, we can rearrange the equation to find a relationship between M(Y) and n:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe can now test integer values for `n` (a plausible oxidation state) to find an element with a matching molar mass:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Ca, Ar - unlikely)\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Br, Se - possible but chemistry is less fitting)\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This value is an excellent match for the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Dy, Tb - less plausible chemistry for oxidizing xenon).\n*   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Pu, Am - strong candidates, but their fluorides do not match the provided MW ranges).\n\nLet's verify the Antimony (Sb) hypothesis. If Y = Sb and n = 3, then A2 is SbF₃. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is:\nɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%\nThis value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, strongly suggesting that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify A4 by its molecular weight.**\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. We have identified Y as Antimony, so A4 must be one of its binary fluorides. The two most common and stable fluorides are Antimony(III) fluoride (SbF₃) and Antimony(V) fluoride (SbF₅). We will calculate their molecular weights and see which one fits the provided options.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF₃**\n    Molecular Weight (MW) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n*   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF₅**\n    Molecular Weight (MW) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with the given options and select the most consistent answer.**\nLet's check the given ranges against our calculated molecular weights.\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\n*   The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within the range **A) 160-180**.\n*   The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges (it is close to, but outside of, range C).\n\nThis \"double clue\" — where the identification of Y from A2's mass percentage leads directly to a compound (A4=A2) whose molecular weight perfectly matches one of the options — provides a very strong and self-consistent path to the answer. The contradictions in the problem's qualitative descriptions (e.g., the color of A1, the stoichiometry of the final reaction) should be considered less reliable than the quantitative data. Therefore, the most consistent conclusion is that A4 is SbF₃.\n\nThe molecular weight of substance A4 is approximately 179 g/mol, which falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Let's test integer values for n.\n    -   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 (closest is Ca, Ar - unlikely)\n    -   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 (closest is Br, Se - possible)\n    -   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 (closest is Sb, Antimony, M=121.76 g/mol)\n    -   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.80 (closest is Dy, Dysprosium, M=162.50 g/mol)\n    -   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 (closest are Au, Pt, Hg, Pb)\n    -   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.70 (closest is Pu, Plutonium, M≈244 g/mol)\n\n    To narrow this down, I will use a python script to check all elements for a close match.\n\n    ```python\n    import periodictable\n\n    def find_element():\n        # M(Y) = 40.4493 * n\n        best_fits = []\n        for element in periodictable.elements:\n            if element.mass and element.number > 2: # Exclude H, He and elements without a standard atomic weight\n                for n in range(1, 9):\n                    target_mass = 40.4493 * n\n                    error = abs(element.mass - target_mass) / element.mass * 100\n                    if error < 1.0: # We are looking for a very good fit, error < 1%\n                        best_fits.append((element.symbol, element.mass, n, target_mass, error))\n\n        # Sort by error to see the best fits first\n        best_fits.sort(key=lambda x: x[4])\n\n        for fit in best_fits:\n            print(f\"Element: {fit[0]}, M(Element): {fit[1]:.2f}, For n={fit[2]}, Calculated M(Y) is: {fit[3]:.2f}, Error: {fit[4]:.2f}%\")\n\n    find_element()\n    ```\n    The code output shows the best candidates based on the mass percentage.\n    ```\n    Element: Sb, M(Element): 121.76, For n=3, Calculated M(Y) is: 121.35, Error: 0.34%\n    Element: Dy, M(Element): 162.50, For n=4, Calculated M(Y) is: 161.80, Error: 0.43%\n    Element: Pu, M(Element): 244.06, For n=6, Calculated M(Y) is: 242.70, Error: 0.56%\n    ```\n\n3.  **Evaluate the best candidates against other clues.**\n    The problem states: \"A1 decomposes ... into A2 ... and fluorine (F2)\". This means the reaction is `A1 -> A2 + F2`. Chemically, this implies A1 is a higher fluoride of Y than A2 (i.e., A1 = YF_{m} and A2 = YF_{n} with m > n).\n\n    -   **Candidate Pu (Plutonium)**: If Y=Pu, then n=6, so A2 = PuF6. For the decomposition A1 -> PuF6 + F2 to occur, A1 would need to be a higher fluoride like PuF7 or PuF8, which are not known to exist. This rules out Pu.\n    -   **Candidate Dy (Dysprosium)**: If Y=Dy, then n=4, so A2 = DyF4. DyF4 is the highest known fluoride of dysprosium. A higher fluoride A1 does not exist. This rules out Dy.\n    -   **Candidate Sb (Antimony)**: If Y=Sb, then n=3, so A2 = SbF3. A known higher fluoride is SbF5. So, the reaction could be `SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2`. This is chemically plausible. A1 could be SbF5.\n\n4.  **Adopt Y=Sb and verify all clues.**\n    Let's assume Y is Antimony (Sb).\n    -   **Y = Sb**.\n    -   **A2 = SbF3**. (Mass % of F is 31.88%, a near-perfect match with the given 31.96%).\n    -   **A1 = SbF5**. This is required for the decomposition `A1 -> A2 + F2`.\n    -   Let's check the properties of A1=SbF5: The problem says A1 is \"bright-red\" and \"decomposes at 293 K\". Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is actually a colorless liquid/solid and is stable at room temperature. This is a significant discrepancy. However, given that other candidates led to chemical impossibilities, it is common in such complex problems that some descriptive data may be flawed. We will proceed assuming this is the case.\n    -   \"A1 oxidizes xenon\": SbF5 is an extremely strong Lewis acid and a powerful oxidizing agent. It reacts with Xenon to form [XeF]⁺[Sb₂F₁₁]⁻, which involves the oxidation of Xe. This clue fits.\n    -   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\". Fluorination of Sb yields SbF3 or SbF5. Since A3 interacts with xenon, it must be the strong oxidizer, **A3 = SbF5**. This is consistent with A1=A3.\n    -   \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" A4 is a binary fluoride of antimony. The solution is colorless. Both SbF3 and SbF5 form colorless solutions.\n    -   If A4 = SbF5, the reaction with Sb would be a comproportionation: `2 Sb + 3 SbF5 -> 5 SbF3`. The molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, not 1:1. So, A4 is not SbF5.\n    -   If A4 = SbF3, the reaction is `Sb + SbF3 -> A5`. The molar ratio is 1:1. This fits the description.\n    -   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" The product A5 would have an empirical formula of \"Sb2F3\", implying an intermediate oxidation state for antimony (+1.5). Such species are unstable and would readily decompose (disproportionate) in water. This also fits.\n\n5.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, the compound A4 must be Antimony Trifluoride (SbF3).\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(A4) = M(SbF3) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\n    M(A4) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n\n6.  **Select the correct range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol. We check which of the given ranges this value falls into:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 220-240\n\n    178.76 falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n. The molar mass of Y (M(Y)) can be related to the molar mass of fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) by the formula for mass fraction:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging for M(Y):\n    M(Y) = (n * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n * 19.00)\n    M(Y) ≈ n * (59.45 - 19.00)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We need to find an integer `n` that results in a realistic atomic mass for an element Y that is known to form multiple fluorides. Let's test integer values for `n`:\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to K, Ca, Ar). These don't fit the required chemical properties (multiple fluorides, reaction with xenon).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br, Se). Bromine and Selenium fluorides do not match the mass fraction.\n    *   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dy). Dysprosium chemistry does not fit well.\n    *   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Bi, Hg). The fit is not as good as for Sb.\n\n    Let's verify the mass fraction for SbF3:\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This is very close to the given 31.96% (an error of only ~0.25%), making it the most likely candidate.\n    Therefore, **Y = Sb (Antimony)** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of the Other Substances.**\n    *   **A1**: A bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (room temperature) into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. The reaction is A1 → SbF3 + F2. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony, containing Sb(V). The simplest would be SbF5. A1 also oxidizes xenon, a known property of strong fluorinating agents like SbF5. However, pure SbF5 is a colorless liquid and is relatively stable. A1 must be a different, less stable, and colored form or compound of Sb(V) fluoride.\n    *   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Sb with F2. This reaction can produce SbF3 or SbF5. A3 also interacts with xenon. SbF5 is a very strong Lewis acid and readily forms adducts with xenon fluorides (e.g., [XeF]+[SbF6]-), while SbF3 does not react with xenon. Therefore, **A3 = SbF5**.\n    *   This confirms that A1 and A3 are different substances, even though both contain Sb(V). This supports the idea that A1 is a special, unstable Sb(V) fluoride.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4.\n    *   A4 is one of the five known binary fluorides of antimony.\n    *   A5 is obtained by reacting Y (Sb) with A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction is Sb + A4 → A5.\n    *   This reaction takes place in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n\n    A4 is most likely one of the two common fluorides: SbF3 or SbF5.\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = SbF5.** The reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(V)F5 → A5. This is a comproportionation reaction, which is chemically very plausible. The product A5 would have the empirical formula Sb2F5. The description \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" fits well, as SbF5 is a colorless liquid.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = SbF3.** The reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(III)F3 → A5. This reaction to form a subfluoride (A5 would be Sb2F3) is also possible. SbF3 is a white/colorless solid, so a colorless solution can be made.\n\n4.  **Calculate Molecular Weights and Compare with Options.**\n    We need to determine whether A4 is SbF3 or SbF5. The provided options for the molecular weight range will be the deciding factor.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF3**: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF5**: M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n    Now let's check the given ranges:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 220-240\n\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit any range well. It is close to range D, but outside of it.\n\n    Given the perfect fit for SbF3, it is the only logical choice for A4.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, substance A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF3). Its molecular weight is approximately 178.76 g/mol, which falls in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2 using the Mass Percentage of Fluorine.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), and the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\n    The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 18.998 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    0.3196 = (n * 18.998) / (M_Y + n * 18.998)\n    Let's rearrange to solve for the atomic mass of Y (M_Y):\n    M_Y + n * 18.998 = (n * 18.998) / 0.3196\n    M_Y = (n * 18.998 / 0.3196) - (n * 18.998)\n    M_Y = n * 18.998 * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M_Y ≈ n * 40.45\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer n (oxidation state) that satisfy this relationship. We can test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca at 40.08 g/mol)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (closest is Br at 79.90 g/mol)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb at 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (closest is Dy at 162.50 g/mol)\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Bi at 208.98 g/mol)\n\n    Let's calculate the exact fluorine percentage for the most promising candidate, Antimony (Sb) with n=3.\n    Y = Sb (M_Y = 121.76 g/mol), A2 = SbF3.\n    ɷF in SbF3 = (3 * 18.998) / (121.76 + 3 * 18.998) = 56.994 / 178.754 = 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a relative difference of only about 0.25%. This is a very strong indication that Y is Sb and A2 is SbF3.\n\n2.  **Identify the Other Compounds based on Y=Sb.**\n    *   **A2 = SbF3**.\n    *   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride of antimony. The most common and stable higher fluoride is SbF5. So, **A1 = SbF5**. The reaction is SbF5 → SbF3 + F2.\n    *   **Contradictions**: The problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes at 293 K and \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\". SbF5 is a colorless liquid, is relatively stable at 293 K (decomposes at higher temperatures), and while a strong oxidizer, its reaction with xenon is not as famously spontaneous as PtF6. In complex chemical puzzles, it's common for some qualitative descriptions to be slightly inaccurate or misleading, whereas numerical data is usually precise. Given the excellent numerical fit, we proceed with the Y=Sb hypothesis.\n    *   **A3**: A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and can interact with xenon. Fluorinating antimony can produce SbF3 or SbF5. Since it interacts with xenon (implying strong oxidizing/Lewis acidic properties), **A3 = SbF5**. This is consistent with A1=A3.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: A5 is obtained by adding Y (Sb) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. A4 is one of the five binary fluorides. For antimony, the main two are SbF3 and SbF5.\n\n3.  **Determine A4 by Checking the Answer Options.**\n    We need to find the molecular weight range for A4. Let's calculate the molecular weights of the possible compounds for A4 (SbF3 and SbF5) and see which one fits the given ranges.\n    *   **MW of SbF3**: 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    *   **MW of SbF5**: 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n    Now, let's look at the options:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 220-240\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.754 g/mol) falls squarely into range **A) 160-180**.\n    The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.75 g/mol) does not fit into any of the provided ranges.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, A4 must be SbF3. This is consistent with the clues: SbF3 is a white solid that can form a colorless solution in a suitable solvent (like HF). The reaction SbF3 + Sb → A5 (\"Sb2F3\") is a plausible comproportionation in a hot solution/melt. The resulting sub-fluoride (A5) would be expected to decompose in water into two substances (e.g., Sb metal and an Sb(III) compound) via disproportionation, which also fits the description.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is approximately 179 g/mol, which falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on the detailed step-by-step reasoning and calculations performed:\n\n1.  **Element Identification**: The element Y was identified as Antimony (Sb) based on the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2. A2 was identified as SbF3.\n2.  **Compound Identification**:\n    *   A4 was identified as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\n    *   A5 was identified as Antimony trifluoride (SbF3).\n3.  **Molecular Weight Calculation**:\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 (SbF5) is approximately 216.76 g/mol.\n    *   The molecular weight of A5 (SbF3) is approximately 178.76 g/mol.\n4.  **Conclusion**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. However, its calculated value (216.76 g/mol) does not fit into any of the given options. The molecular weight of A5 (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly into the range C (160-180). This strongly suggests a typographical error in the question, where it should have asked for the molecular weight of A5 instead of A4. Assuming this likely error, the correct choice is the one corresponding to A5.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YF_n), and the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    Where M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    M(Y) = M(F) * n * (1/ɷF - 1)\n    M(Y) = 19.00 * n * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M(Y) = 19.00 * n * (3.1289 - 1)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now, we test integer values for n (the number of fluorine atoms):\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, Ar, K - none form 5+ fluorides)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, Se - BrF, BrF3, BrF5 known.

Krypton's mass is 83.8 g/mol.\n        Let's check the mass percentage for A2 = KrF₂:\n        ɷF(KrF₂) = (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 = 0.3120 or 31.20%.\n        This value is also close to 31.96%, but the match for Sb is significantly better.\n\n3.  **Test the Antimony (Sb) hypothesis against the other clues.**\n    *   Y = Sb, A2 = SbF₃.\n    *   \"A1 decomposes ... into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine.\" This implies A1 is SbF₅ (SbF₅ -> SbF₃ + F₂). However, SbF₅ is very stable and is synthesized from SbF₃ and F₂, it does not decompose this way. This is a major contradiction.\n    *   \"A1 is a bright-red substance.\" SbF₅ is a colorless liquid. This is another major contradiction.\n    *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y\". Sb + F₂ -> SbF₅. So A3 = SbF₅.

A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This means Sb + A4 -> A5 (1:1). If A4 is SbF₅, the known comproportionation reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃, which is not a 1:1 ratio. No other common reaction fits this 1:1 stoichiometry.\n    *   The antimony hypothesis, despite the excellent mass percentage match, leads to multiple strong contradictions.\n\n4.  **Test the Krypton (Kr) hypothesis.**\n    Although the mass % match is not perfect, let's see if the other clues provide a more consistent picture. Such problems can sometimes contain minor numerical errors.\n    *   Y = Kr, A2 = KrF₂.\n    *   \"A1 decomposes ... into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine.\" This means A1 = KrF₄. The reaction KrF₄ -> KrF₂ + F₂ is known to occur as KrF₄ is unstable. This fits.\n    *   \"A1 is a bright-red substance.\" KrF₄ is reported as a white solid. This is a contradiction.\n    *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" KrF₄ would be a very strong oxidizing agent, stronger than KrF₂. Plausible.\n    *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y\". Kr + F₂ -> KrF₂. So A3 = KrF₂. This is correct.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" KrF₂ reacts with xenon (KrF₂ + Xe -> XeF₂ + Kr). This fits.\n    *   \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... A4, A5 can be obtained.\" Let's assume the compounds are not all distinct. If A4=A1=KrF₄, the reaction would be:\n        **Kr + KrF₄ -> 2KrF₂**\n        This reaction is a comproportionation. Crucially, the reactants Kr (Y) and KrF₄ (A4) are in a **1:1 molar ratio**. The product A5 would be KrF₂. This fits the clue perfectly.\n    *   \"Five binary compounds... are known.\" This is a major issue for Krypton, as only KrF₂ is well-established, and KrF₄ is debatable. This seems to be an error in the problem statement.\n    *   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" A5 = KrF₂. Hydrolysis of KrF₂ gives Kr, HF, and O₂ (three substances). This is another contradiction.\n\n5.  **Compare the hypotheses and conclude.**\n    The Antimony (Sb) case has a perfect numerical match but fails on several key chemical reactions and properties. The 1:1 reaction seems impossible to satisfy.\n    The Krypton (Kr) case has a slightly imperfect numerical match and contradicts some descriptive facts (color, number of compounds, hydrolysis products). However, it provides a perfect and elegant explanation for the stoichiometric clues, particularly the 1:1 reaction (Kr + KrF₄). In complex chemistry problems, stoichiometric evidence often outweighs descriptive details which might be simplified or contain errors. The 1:1 reaction is a very strong pointer towards the Krypton hypothesis.\n\n6.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on the more consistent Krypton hypothesis, the compound A4 is KrF₄.\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight.\n    ```python\n    # Molar mass of Krypton (Kr)\n    M_Kr = 83.798  # g/mol\n    # Molar mass of Fluorine (F)\n    M_F = 18.9984 # g/mol\n    # Molecular weight of KrF4\n    M_KrF4 = M_Kr + 4 * M_F\n    print(M_KrF4)\n    ```\n    159.7916\n\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) is approximately 159.8 g/mol.\n    Now, we check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 110-130\n\n    The value 159.8 g/mol falls within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YF_n, where M_Y is the atomic mass of Y, M_F is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * (M_Y + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * M_Y + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 12.9276n\n    M_Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now we can test integer values for n (which represents the oxidation state of Y in A2) to find a plausible atomic mass for Y.\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Ca, K)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br, Se, Kr)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (similar to Sb, Te, I)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (similar to Dy, Tb)\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Pb, Hg)\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidate Elements.**\n    We need to find an element that matches one of these M_Y values and also fits the other chemical descriptions:\n    *   Forms five binary fluorides.\n    *   Has a fluoride (A1) that is a strong oxidizing agent (oxidizes xenon) and decomposes at room temperature (293 K). A1 decomposes to A2 and F2, so A1 has a higher oxidation state than A2.\n\n    Let's test the best candidates from the calculation:\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** For n=2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Kr has M=83.8 g/mol. Let's check if A2=KrF2. The theoretical %F in KrF2 is (2*19)/ (83.8 + 38) = 31.2%. This is reasonably close. However, Kr only forms one well-characterized fluoride (KrF2), not five. This contradicts a key point.\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** For n=3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. The atomic mass of Sb is 121.76 g/mol. This is an excellent match. Let's check the %F in A2 = SbF3.\n        M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n        This value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. This makes Sb the most likely candidate for Y.\n\n3.  **Verify Antimony (Sb) with Other Clues.**\n    Let's assume Y = Sb and A2 = SbF3.\n    *   **A1 decomposes to A2 (SbF3) and F2.** This implies A1 is a higher fluoride, which would be SbF5. The reaction is SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2.\n    *   **A1 oxidizes xenon.** SbF5 is a very strong Lewis acid and fluorinating agent, known to react with and oxidize xenon (e.g., Xe + 2SbF5 → [XeF][Sb2F11]). This fits.\n    *   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y.** Sb + F2 → SbF5. This reaction produces A3, which can also react with xenon. So A3 is also SbF5.\n    *   **Contradictions:** The problem states there are five binary fluorides of Y, but only SbF3 and SbF5 are common. It also states A1 is bright-red and decomposes at 293 K. SbF5 is a colorless liquid that is stable at 293K. These points seem to be flaws in the problem statement, but the numerical match for SbF3 is too strong to ignore.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. Based on our deductions, Y is Sb, and its known fluorides are A2=SbF3 and A1=A3=SbF5. A4 must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony. So, A4 is likely either SbF3 or SbF5.\n\n    Let's analyze the final reaction: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   **If A4 = SbF5:** The reaction is Sb + SbF5 → A5. This is a plausible comproportionation reaction where Sb(0) reduces Sb(V).\n    *   **If A4 = SbF3:** The reaction is Sb + SbF3 → A5. This reaction is not chemically plausible under normal conditions, as you cannot reduce Sb(III) with Sb(0) metal.\n\n    This chemical reasoning suggests A4 should be SbF5. Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n    This value (216.76) does not fall into any of the given ranges. It is close to range C (220-240), but not within it.\n\n    Let's consider the alternative, A4 = SbF3. Its molecular weight is:\n    M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol.\n    This value falls perfectly within range D (160-180).\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    We have a conflict:\n    *   Chemical reasoning points to A4 = SbF5, but its MW doesn't match any option.\n    *   A perfect numerical match exists for A4 = SbF3 with option D, but the associated chemical reaction seems illogical as written.\n\n    In chemistry problems of this nature, a precise numerical fit is often the intended clue, and descriptive parts can sometimes be flawed or simplified. The identification of Y as Sb via the %F in SbF3 is very solid. The fact that the molecular weight of this very same compound, SbF3 (178.76 g/mol), fits perfectly into one of the answer ranges (160-180) is highly unlikely to be a coincidence. Therefore, it is most probable that A4 is intended to be SbF3, despite the problematic description of the final reaction.\n\n    The substance A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol, which is in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the composition of A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFm. The atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (m * 19.00) / (M(Y) + m * 19.00)\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the atomic mass of element Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * m * 19.00 = m * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = m * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = m * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * m\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m\n\n    We need to find an integer 'm' (the number of fluorine atoms) that results in a realistic atomic mass for an element Y that fits the described chemical properties.\n\n2.  **Evaluate chemical properties to constrain Y.**\n    *   **Five binary compounds with fluorine:** This suggests a transition metal, post-transition metal, or a halogen/noble gas with a wide range of oxidation states.\n    *   **A1 is bright-red, decomposes at 293 K (20 °C), and oxidizes xenon:** This points to a highly unstable fluoride of an element in a very high oxidation state. Compounds like PtF6, or fluorides of gold (Au) or certain actinides are known for such properties. A1 decomposing into A2 and F2 (A1 → A2 + F2) implies A1 has a higher fluorine content than A2.\n    *   Let's test potential values for 'm' from the mass calculation:\n        *   m=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.4 g/mol (like Ca, K, Ar): Unlikely chemistry.\n        *   m=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (like Br): Bromine has only 3 common fluorides (BrF, BrF3, BrF5). Doesn't fit.\n        *   m=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (like Sb): SbF5 is the highest fluoride and is not red, nor does it decompose in this manner.\n        *   m=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Lanthanides): Unlikely chemistry.\n        *   m=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol: This is close to Gold (Au, 197.0), Mercury (Hg, 200.6), Thallium (Tl, 204.4), Lead (Pb, 207.2), Bismuth (Bi, 209.0).\n\n3.  **Hypothesize Y = Au (Gold).**\n    Let's check if gold fits the chemical description, even if the mass calculation isn't perfect.\n    *   **Five fluorides:** Yes, AuF, AuF2, AuF3, AuF5, and the (possibly unstable/theoretical) AuF7 are known or have been reported. This fits.\n    *   **A1, A2:** The reaction A1 → A2 + F2 strongly suggests A1=AuF7 and A2=AuF5. AuF7 would be an extremely powerful oxidizer, capable of oxidizing Xenon. High-oxidation state gold compounds can be red. AuF5 is a red solid. This is a very strong fit for the chemical behavior.\n    *   Let's re-check ɷF for A2 = AuF5. M(Au) ≈ 197.0 g/mol. M(AuF5) = 197.0 + 5*19.0 = 292.0 g/mol. ɷF = (5*19)/292 = 95/292 ≈ 32.5%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, and the discrepancy could be due to an error in the problem statement. The chemical evidence for Au is compelling.\n    *   **A3:** A3 is made by fluorinating Au. This could be AuF3 or AuF5. Both are strong Lewis acids and could interact with xenon species (e.g., AuF5 + XeF2 → [XeF][AuF6]). This fits.\n\n4.  **Identify A4 and A5.**\n    With Y=Au, the remaining fluorides for A4 and A5 are AuF, AuF2, and AuF3. Their approximate molecular weights are:\n    *   M(AuF) = 197 + 19 = 216 g/mol\n    *   M(AuF2) = 197 + 38 = 235 g/mol\n    *   M(AuF3) = 197 + 57 = 254 g/mol\n\n    The reaction is: **Y + A4 → A5** (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n    This translates to: **Au + A4 → A5**.\n    The statement \"A5 decomposes in water with the formation of two substances\" is characteristic of disproportionation, which often happens with elements in intermediate oxidation states, like Au(I) or Au(II).\n\n    Let's test the comproportionation reaction: `x Au(0) + y Au(n) → (x+y) Au(m)`.\n    The molar ratio is 1:1, so x=1 and y=1. The reaction is: `Au(0) + AuF_n → 2 AuF_{n/2}`.\n    For the product to be a simple binary fluoride, n/2 must be an integer. This means n must be even.\n\n    *   Let's test `n=2`. A4 = AuF2.\n        *   The reaction becomes: **Au + AuF2 → 2 AuF**.\n        *   The reactants (Au and AuF2) are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This fits the problem description perfectly.\n        *   The product is A5 = AuF.\n        *   Does A5 (AuF) decompose in water? Yes, gold(I) disproportionates: `3AuF → 2Au(s) + AuF3(aq)`. This forms two substances (elemental gold and aqueous gold(III) fluoride). This also fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on our consistent hypothesis, A4 is AuF2.\n    The molecular weight of A4 (AuF2) is M = 197 + 2*19 = 235 g/mol.\n\n6.  **Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Ranges.**\n    We need to find which range contains 235 g/mol.\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 235 falls squarely within the range 220-240.\n\n*(Note: The problem contains some inconsistencies, such as the exact fluorine percentage and the \"colorless\" nature of the A4 solution (Au(II) compounds are typically colored). However, the Gold hypothesis provides the most coherent explanation for the majority of the chemical transformations described, especially the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry and the decomposition of A5.)*\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The primary goal is to determine the chemical identity of substance A4 and calculate its molecular weight to find the correct range among the given options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   There are five binary compounds of element Y and Fluorine (F).\n    *   **A2** is a key substance because we have quantitative data for it: the mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) is 31.96%.\n    *   **A1** is a bright-red substance, decomposes into A2 and F₂, and is a powerful oxidizing agent (oxidizes Xenon).\n    *   **A3** is another fluoride that also oxidizes Xenon and is formed by fluorinating Y.\n    *   **A4** is a fluoride whose hot, colorless, concentrated solution is used in a reaction.\n    *   **A5** is formed by adding element Y to the solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n3.  **Use the Quantitative Data to Identify Element Y:**\n    *   Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where 'n' is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    *   The atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is ~19.00 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\n        ωF = (n × M_F) / (M_Y + n × M_F)\n    *   We are given ωF = 0.3196.

Unlikely to form 5 fluorides and oxidize Xe.\n    *   n = 2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (near Br, Se). Possible, but the chemistry is less fitting.\n    *   n = 3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Antimony is known to form multiple fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅).\n    *   n = 4: M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (near Dy). Unlikely.\n    *   n = 5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (near Pt, Au). Possible, but the mass fit is not as good as for Sb.\n    *   n = 6: M_Y ≈ 242.70 g/mol (near Pu). Possible, but let's prioritize the best mass fit.\n\n5.  **Develop the Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:**\n    *   Let's assume **Y = Sb**. This means n=3, and substance **A2 = SbF₃**.\n    *   Let's verify the mass percentage for SbF₃: M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3(19.00) = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ωF = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (or 31.88%). This is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and F₂. The reaction must be: SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂. Therefore, **A1 = SbF₅**.\n    *   A3 is formed by fluorinating Y: Sb + F₂ → SbF₅. Therefore, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n    *   This fits the clue that both A1 and A3 can oxidize Xenon, as SbF₅ is a powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent that forms adducts with XeF₂.\n    *   *Note:* While the problem states A1 is \"bright-red\" and decomposes at 293 K, and SbF₅ is actually a colorless liquid that is stable, in chemistry problems of this type, a strong quantitative match often outweighs discrepancies in physical descriptions.\n\n6.  **Identify Substance A4 and Calculate its Molecular Weight:**\n    *   We need to identify A4, which is one of the five fluorides of Antimony.

The mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is an excellent match for A2. The molecular weight of SbF₃ is 178.76 g/mol, which fits perfectly into the range 160-180. Therefore, A4 is most likely SbF₃.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the detailed step-by-step reasoning and the calculation confirmed by the code execution:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The mass percentage of fluorine (31.96%) in compound A2 (YF_n) leads to the relationship M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n. Testing integer values for n, we find that for n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol, which strongly suggests the element is Dysprosium (Dy, atomic mass 162.50 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A4:** The reaction for forming A5 is a 1:1 molar reaction between Y and A4: `Y + A4 → A5`. This is a comproportionation reaction. With Y=Dy, the reaction `Dy + DyF4 → 2DyF2` fits this 1:1 stoichiometry. This identifies A4 as DyF4.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   Formula of A4: DyF4\n    *   Atomic mass of Dy: 162.50 g/mol\n    *   Atomic mass of F: 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular weight of A4 = 162.50 + 4 × 19.00 = 238.50 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Select the Correct Range:** The calculated molecular weight of 238.50 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.

This is also very close.\n\n**Step 2: Use other chemical clues to distinguish between candidates.**\n\nLet's evaluate the Antimony (Sb) hypothesis, as it's a more common element in this context than Plutonium.\n*   **Element Y = Sb (Antimony)**\n*   **A2 = SbF₃** (Antimony trifluoride). ɷF = 31.88%, which is a good fit.\n*   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** For Antimony, SbF₃ and SbF₅ are very well known. Mixed-valence compounds like Sb₂F₁₁⁻ (in salts) and polymeric structures exist, and other fluorides have been reported under specific conditions. It is plausible that five compounds are considered \"known\".\n*   **\"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine.\"** The reaction is A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. This means A1 must have a higher fluorine content than SbF₃. The most likely candidate for A1 is **SbF₅** (Antimony pentafluoride). The decomposition would be SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂. This is a known equilibrium, especially at higher temperatures. The problem stating it decomposes at 293K (20°C) implies this equilibrium favors SbF₃ at room temperature, which is reasonable.\n*   **\"A1 (SbF₅) is a bright-red substance.\"** Solid SbF₅ is typically described as colorless, but impurities (like traces of bromine if used in preparation) can give it a yellow or brown color. \"Bright-red\" is a slight discrepancy, but chemical descriptions can vary. However, SbF₅ is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent.\n*   **\"A1 (SbF₅) oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"** SbF₅ reacts with Xenon to form compounds like XeF₂·SbF₅ and XeF₂·2SbF₅. This is a perfect match.\n*   **\"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Sb) with fluorine.\"** Sb + F₂ can produce SbF₃ or SbF₅ depending on conditions. So, A3 could be SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n*   **\"A3 can also interact with xenon.\"** If A3 is SbF₅, this is consistent. If A3 is SbF₃, it does not react with Xenon. So, **A3 is also SbF₅**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and A5.**\n\n*   **\"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** The reaction is Sb + A4 → A5. A4 is a \"colorless concentrated solution\".\n*   This points towards fluoroantimonic acid, H[SbF₆], which is a superacid. It is formed by reacting SbF₅ with HF.\n    HF + SbF₅ → H[SbF₆]\n    So, **A4 is H[SbF₆]**.\n*   The reaction becomes: Sb + H[SbF₆] → A5. This is a reaction in a highly acidic, fluorinating medium. It's likely a redox reaction where Sb⁰ is oxidized. A possible reaction is the formation of a mixed-valence antimony compound.\n*   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"** A plausible product for A5 is the salt of the [Sb₃F₁₄]⁻ anion, with H⁺ as the cation: H[Sb₃F₁₄]. This compound is known to exist.\n    The overall reaction to form A5 would be: 2 Sb + H[SbF₆] + 11 HF → H[Sb₃F₁₄] + 6 H₂ (unlikely) or perhaps involving SbF₅ from the solution. A more plausible reaction involves the SbF₅ used to make the acid:\n    2 Sb + 3 SbF₅ → 5 SbF₃. This is a known comproportionation reaction. If the solution is H[SbF₆], the reaction might be more complex, but the idea of Sb⁰ reducing Sb(V) is sound. A5 could be related to SbF₃ or a complex fluoroantimonate(III). Let's assume A5 is a complex that decomposes in water. For example, fluoroantimonates(III) hydrolyze.\n\nThe identification of **A4 as fluoroantimonic acid, H[SbF₆]**, is the most chemically sound conclusion based on the clues.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\n*   **A4 = H[SbF₆]**\n*   Molar Mass (H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass (Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass (F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n\nM(H[SbF₆]) = 1.008 + 121.76 + 6 * 18.998\nM(H[SbF₆]) = 1.008 + 121.76 + 113.988\nM(H[SbF₆]) = 236.756 g/mol\n\n**Step 5: Match the calculated molecular weight to the given ranges.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 236.756 g/mol. This value falls within the range:\nB) 220-240\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on the detailed reasoning and the output from the code execution, the solution is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The mass percentage of fluorine (31.96%) in compound A2 strongly suggests that A2 is SbF3 (Antimony Trifluoride). The calculated mass percentage of F in SbF3 is approximately 31.88%, which is a very close match. Therefore, element Y is Antimony (Sb).\n\n2.  **Identify Candidate for A4:** The problem describes several binary compounds of Antimony and Fluorine. The most stable and common are SbF3 and SbF5. Therefore, A4 is likely one of these two compounds.\n\n3.  **Calculate Molecular Weight of Candidates:**\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF3 = 121.76 + (3 * 19.00) = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF5 = 121.76 + (5 * 19.00) = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n4.  **Match with Given Ranges:** The question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls.\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls within the range **D) 160-180**.\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n\nThe code execution confirmed this calculation: `Molecular weight of SbF3: 178.754... The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.75) falls into range D: 160-180.`\n\nTherefore, substance A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. Let's assume A2 has the general formula YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, Ar(Y) is the atomic weight of Y, and Ar(F) is the atomic weight of fluorine (approximately 18.998 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for Ar(Y):\n0.3196 = (n * 18.998) / (Ar(Y) + n * 18.998)\nAr(Y) + n * 18.998 = (n * 18.998) / 0.3196\nAr(Y) = (n * 18.998 / 0.3196) - (n * 18.998)\nAr(Y) = n * (59.443 - 18.998)\nAr(Y) ≈ n * 40.445\n\nNow, we test integer values for n to find a corresponding element Y with a close atomic weight.\n\n*   If n = 1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest element is Calcium, Ca, Ar=40.08)\n*   If n = 2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.89 g/mol (Closest is Bromine, Br, Ar=79.90)\n*   If n = 3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.34 g/mol (Closest is Antimony, Sb, Ar=121.76)\n*   If n = 4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.78 g/mol (Closest is Dysprosium, Dy, Ar=162.50)\n*   If n = 5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.23 g/mol (Closest is Mercury, Hg, Ar=200.59)\n*   If n = 6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.67 g/mol (Closest is Plutonium, Pu, Ar=244)\n\nLet's check the properties given in the problem:\n*   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"\n*   \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" This points to Y being an element that forms a very powerful fluorinating agent.\n\nPlutonium (Pu) is a strong candidate. Let's verify the fluorine percentage in PuF₆ (assuming n=6).\nAr(Pu) = 244 g/mol.\nωF in PuF₆ = (6 * 18.998) / (244 + 6 * 18.998) = 113.988 / (244 + 113.988) = 113.988 / 357.988 ≈ 0.3184 or 31.84%. This is very close to the given 31.96%. The small discrepancy can be attributed to using a specific isotope of Plutonium or slight experimental error in the given percentage.\n\nLet's check the other properties for Plutonium:\n*   **Five binary fluorides:** While PuF₃, PuF₄, and PuF₆ are the most common, less stable or intermediate fluorides exist, and the problem statement that \"five are known\" is a plausible premise for a chemistry problem involving plutonium.\n*   **A1 oxidizes Xenon:** A1 decomposes into A2 (PuF₆) and fluorine. This suggests A1 is a higher, unstable fluoride of plutonium. A compound like PuF₈ (though hypothetical or extremely unstable) would be an incredibly strong oxidant, capable of oxidizing xenon. Even PuF₆ itself is a very strong oxidant. The decomposition would be: PuF₈ → PuF₆ + F₂. So, A1 could be PuF₈.\n*   **A3 interacts with Xenon:** A3 is formed by fluorinating Y (Pu). This typically forms the most stable higher fluoride, PuF₆. PuF₆ is known to react with xenon difluoride (XeF₂) to form complexes, so it \"interacts with xenon\".\n\nTherefore, it is highly probable that **Y is Plutonium (Pu)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Compounds A1-A5**\n\n*   **Y**: Plutonium (Pu)\n*   **A2**: PuF₆ (ωF ≈ 31.96%)\n*   **A1**: A higher, unstable fluoride that decomposes to PuF₆ and F₂. Let's assume PuF₈ for the reaction: PuF₈ → PuF₆ + F₂. It is bright-red and oxidizes Xe.\n*   **A3**: The product of fluorinating Pu, which is PuF₆.\n*   **A4 & A5**: The problem states: \"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" The term \"solution\" implies a solvent. For inorganic fluorine chemistry, a common non-aqueous solvent is hydrogen fluoride (HF). The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 ratio suggests a comproportionation reaction where plutonium in different oxidation states reacts. A common reaction in plutonium fluoride chemistry in HF is:\n    Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃\n    This reaction fits the 1:3 stoichiometry. Another possibility involves plutonyl fluoride.\n    However, a simpler reaction fitting the 1:1 stoichiometry is:\n    Pu(VI) + Pu(IV) → 2Pu(V) or Pu(VI) + Pu(0) -> ...\n    A well-known reaction is the preparation of PuF₅:\n    PuF₆ + PuF₄ → 2PuF₅\n    This fits the `A4 + A3 -> 2A5` pattern, but the prompt says `Y + A4 -> A5` (1:1).\n    Let's reconsider the reaction: Pu + A4 -> A5.\n    If A4 is PuF₄, the reaction `Pu + PuF₄` does not proceed in a simple 1:1 manner to a single product.\n    If A4 is PuO₂F₂ (Plutonyl fluoride), which is a colorless solid soluble in HF, the reaction could be:\n    Pu + 3PuO₂F₂ + 8HF → 4PuF₄ + 4H₂O\n    This is not 1:1.\n\n    Let's re-examine the comproportionation `Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃`. Maybe the wording \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a... solution of A4\" does not mean the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1, but that the reactants were mixed in that ratio. This is ambiguous.\n\n    Let's explore another possibility. If Y= Krypton(Kr), A2=KrF₂ (ωF=31.2%). A1 could be KrF₄ which decomposes. However, Kr does not form five fluorides.\n\n    Let's stick with Y=Pu. The set of compounds is likely among the known fluorides PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₅, PuF₆, and the unstable A1 (e.g., PuF₈).\n    A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". PuF₄ is a pinkish-brown solid. PuF₃ is purple. PuF₆ is a reddish-brown solid. None are described as colorless. However, plutonyl fluoride, PuO₂F₂, is a colorless solid and its solutions in HF could be considered colorless. Let's assume A4 is PuO₂F₂.\n    The reaction is Pu + PuO₂F₂ in a 1:1 ratio. This might form PuOF₂ or another mixed-oxidation state species, but the chemistry is complex.\n\n    Let's reconsider the possibility that A4 is one of the binary fluorides, and \"colorless solution\" refers to its solution in HF.\n    - If A4 is PuF₄: PuF₄ is a key intermediate. Its molecular weight is 244 + 4*19 = 320 g/mol.\n    - If A4 is PuF₃: Molecular weight is 244 + 3*19 = 301 g/mol.\n    - If A4 is PuF₅: Molecular weight is 244 + 5*19 = 339 g/mol.\n    - If A4 is PuF₆: Molecular weight is 244 + 6*19 = 358 g/mol.\n\n    None of these molecular weights fall into the provided answer ranges. This suggests a mistake in my identification of Y or A4. Let's revisit the initial calculation.\n\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n * 40.445\n\n    Let's check the elements around the calculated atomic weights again, paying close attention to the properties.\n    - n=3, Ar(Y)≈121.34. Element: Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\n      - ωF in SbF₃ = (3*19)/(121.76 + 3*19) = 57/178.76 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match.\n      - Let's check the properties for Antimony (Y=Sb).\n      - **Five binary fluorides**: This is a known point of contention. SbF₃ and SbF₅ are very well known. Mixed-valence compounds like Sb₂F₁₁ ([SbF₄]⁺[SbF₆]⁻) and polymeric forms exist. It's plausible in a problem context to refer to five species like SbF₃, (SbF₃)n, SbF₅, (SbF₅)n, and Sb₂F₁₁.\n      - **A1 oxidizes Xenon**: Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is an extremely strong Lewis acid and oxidant. It can react with XeF₂. Perhaps a higher fluoride or adduct (A1) exists that decomposes into A2=SbF₃.\n        A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. This would mean A1 is SbF₅. But SbF₅ is stable. The decomposition temperature is 149.5 °C, not 20 °C.\n        This path seems problematic.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` (1:1). It is possible that Y is not an element but a compound. But the problem says \"fluorination of element Y\".\n\nLet's assume our initial identification of Y=Pu was correct and there is an issue with our assumption about A4. What if A4 is not a plutonium compound? The problem says \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A5 is obtained from Y and A4. It decomposes in water. This might suggest A5 is a salt.\nA4 could be a fluoride salt of another element, e.g., CsF, in which Pu compounds are dissolved.\n\nLet's rethink the structure.\n1. A1 -> A2 + F2 (A2 = PuF6) -> A1 = PuF8 (hypothetical) or an adduct.\n2. Y = Pu\n3. A3 = PuF6\n4. Pu + A4 -> A5 (1:1 in HF)\n5. A5 + H2O -> two substances\n\nA common reaction in fluoride chemistry is the formation of complex salts. For example, A4 could be an alkali fluoride like CsF. Plutonium hexafluoride (A3) reacts with CsF:\nPuF₆ + CsF → CsPuF₇\nThis doesn't involve element Y (Pu) as a reactant.\n\nWhat if A4 is XeF₂? It is a colorless solid.\nPu + XeF₂ → PuF₂ + Xe.\nHere A5 is PuF₂, which decomposes in water. MW(XeF₂) = 131.29 + 2*19 = 169.29 g/mol. This falls in range C) 160-180.\nLet's check this hypothesis.\n- A4 = XeF₂ (MW = 169.3 g/mol)\n- A5 = PuF₂ (formed from Pu + XeF₂)\n- A5 decomposes in water: PuF₂ + 2H₂O → Pu(OH)₂ + 2HF. This forms two substances.\n- This seems very plausible. A4 is a colorless solid, it can be used to make a solution. The reaction with an active metal like Pu makes sense. Xenon is involved elsewhere in the problem (oxidized by A1/A3), making its presence as a compound plausible.\n\nTherefore, the most logical candidate for A4 is Xenon Difluoride (XeF₂).\nMolecular Weight of XeF₂ = Ar(Xe) + 2 * Ar(F) = 131.29 + 2 * 18.998 = 131.29 + 37.996 = **169.29 g/mol**.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal check of all points with Y=Pu and A4=XeF₂:\n- Five binary fluorides of Y=Pu: Plausible for a problem statement.\n- A1 (e.g. PuF₈) decomposes at 293K to A2 (PuF₆, ωF≈31.9%) and F₂. Plausible.\n- A1 oxidizes Xe. A very high fluoride like PuF₈ would.\n- A3 (PuF₆) interacts with Xe. True, it reacts with XeF₂.\n- A4 is XeF₂. Its solution can be made.\n- Pu + XeF₂ (1:1) → PuF₂ + Xe. A5 = PuF₂. This works.\n- PuF₂ decomposes in water. True.\n\nThe logic holds together. The molecular weight of A4 (XeF₂) is ~169.3 g/mol.\n\nThe given ranges are:\nA) 110-130\nB) 220-240\nC) 160-180\nD) 140-160\n\nOur calculated value of 169.3 g/mol falls squarely in range C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula is YF_n.\n    The formula for mass fraction is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    Using the molar mass of F ≈ 19.00 g/mol:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    M(Y) = (n * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n * 19.00)\n    M(Y) = 59.45n - 19.00n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer n (the number of fluorine atoms) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, Ar)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br, Se)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Sb, Antimony, M=121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element)\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Hg, Au)\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (very close to Pu-242, Am-243)\n\n    Let's check the most promising candidates by calculating the theoretical mass fraction:\n    *   For Y=Sb (Antimony) and n=3, A2 = SbF3.\n        M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 0.3188 (31.88%). This is very close to 31.96%.\n    *   For Y=Pu (Plutonium, isotope 242) and n=6, A2 = PuF6.\n        M(PuF6) = 242.06 + 6 * 19.00 = 356.06 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (6 * 19.00) / 356.06 = 0.3201 (32.01%). Also very close.\n\n    Both Sb and Pu are strong candidates for element Y.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues for A1 and A3.**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and F2. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of Y (YF_m -> YF_n + F2, where m > n).\n    *   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. Then A1 must be SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid and decomposes at much higher temperatures (>400 °C). This is a major contradiction.\n    *   If Y=Pu, A2=PuF6. Then A1 must be a higher fluoride like PuF8. Such a compound is not known to be stable, but for a problem, its existence might be assumed. Being extremely unstable, decomposition at 293 K would be plausible. Its color is unknown, so \"bright-red\" cannot be immediately refuted. PuF6 itself is reddish-brown.\n    *   Both SbF5 and PuF6 are extremely strong oxidizing agents and would react with Xenon, fitting the description for A1 and A3.\n\n    There are inconsistencies in both scenarios, which is common in complex chemistry problems. However, we have enough information to proceed by analyzing the second part of the problem concerning A4.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    The key information is:\n    *   A5 is obtained by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4.\n    *   The reaction is: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 falls into one of the given ranges.\n\n    The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` where Y is a metallic or metalloid element suggests a redox reaction where A4 is an oxidizing agent. Since the problem's context is fluorine chemistry, A4 is likely a fluoride. A4 must also form a colorless solution.\n\n    Let's consider the xenon fluorides as potential candidates for A4, as they are strong fluorinating oxidizers and are colorless.\n    *   **XeF2**: Molar mass = 131.29 + 2 * 19.00 = 169.29 g/mol.\n    *   **XeF4**: Molar mass = 131.29 + 4 * 19.00 = 207.29 g/mol.\n    *   **XeF6**: Molar mass = 131.29 + 6 * 19.00 = 245.29 g/mol.\n\n    Now, let's compare these molecular weights with the given ranges:\n    *   A) 220-240\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 160-180\n\n    Only XeF2 (169.3 g/mol) fits perfectly into one of the ranges: **D) 160-180**. XeF4 and XeF6 do not fit into any of the ranges. This provides very strong evidence that **A4 is XeF2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Rest of the Clues with A4 = XeF2.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Let's see if the reaction `Y + XeF2 -> A5` (1:1) is chemically sound.\n        A plausible reaction is `Y + XeF2 -> YF2 + Xe`. This is a 1:1 reaction between Y and A4. Substance A5 would be YF2.\n    *   **A5 Decomposition:** The problem states A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n        *   If Y=Sb, A5=SbF2. Antimony(II) fluoride would hydrolyze in water, for example: `SbF2 + H2O -> SbO + 2HF`. This produces two substances. This is consistent.\n        *   If Y=Pu, A5=PuF2. Plutonium(II) fluoride would also hydrolyze. This is also consistent.\n    *   **Conclusion on A4:** The identification of A4 as XeF2 is consistent with the reaction chemistry regardless of whether Y is Sb or Pu, and it is the only plausible candidate whose molecular weight fits the given options.\n\n5.  **Final Answer.**\n    The substance A4 is identified as Xenon difluoride (XeF2). Its molecular weight is approximately 169.3 g/mol. This value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    We are given that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote it YF_n) and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    where M_F is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M_Y is the atomic mass of element Y.\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging for M_Y, we get:\n    M_Y = 19.00 * n * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n    We need to find an integer 'n' (the oxidation state of Y in A2) that results in a realistic atomic mass M_Y for an element that can form five binary fluorides and whose compounds can oxidize xenon.\n\n2.  **Test Potential Elements.**\n    *   If n=6, M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 6 = 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic masses of transuranic elements like Plutonium (Pu, ~244 g/mol) or Americium (Am, 243 g/mol). Let's check Pu. If Y=Pu and n=6, A2 would be PuF6. The theoretical mass % of F in PuF6 is (6*19)/(244+6*19) = 114/358 = 31.84%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%. However, calculating the molecular weights of plutonium fluorides (PuF3: 301, PuF4: 320, PuF5: 339, PuF6: 358 g/mol) shows that none of them fall into the low molecular weight ranges given in the options (A, B, C, D). This rules out Plutonium and other heavy elements.\n    *   If n=3, M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol). Let's check the mass % of F in SbF3. M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol. %F = (3*19)/178.76 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match. Let's keep Sb as a candidate.\n    *   Let's test another candidate from the same region of the periodic table, Iodine (I, M=126.9 g/mol). If Y=I, what would n be? n ≈ M_Y / 40.45 = 126.9 / 40.45 ≈ 3.13. This is very close to n=3. So A2 could be IF3. Let's check the mass % of F in IF3. M(IF3) = 126.9 + 3*19 = 183.9 g/mol. %F = (3*19)/183.9 = 30.99%. This is reasonably close to 31.96% (about 3% relative difference).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Candidates Y=Sb and Y=I using other clues.**\n    The crucial clue is the reaction to form A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    This is a comproportionation reaction where elemental Y reduces A4.\n    *   **If Y=Sb:** A4 must have a higher oxidation state than A5. The main fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5. So, A4 must be SbF5 and A5 must be SbF3. The reaction is Sb + SbF5 → SbF3. The balanced reaction is **2** Sb + **3** SbF5 → 5 SbF3. The molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, not 1:1. This contradicts the problem statement. So, Y is not Sb.\n    *   **If Y=I:** The standard state of iodine is I2. \"Adding Y\" refers to adding I2. The known fluorides are IF, IF3, IF5, IF7. Let's test the reaction I2 + A4 → A5. The reaction **I2 + IF3 → 3 IF** is a known comproportionation reaction where the molar ratio of reactants (I2:IF3) is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    This implies **A4 = IF3** and **A5 = IF**.\n\n4.  **Verify the remaining clues for Y=I.**\n    *   **A4 = IF3**: \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". IF3 is a yellow solid, which contradicts \"colorless\". This is a noted inconsistency.\n    *   **A5 = IF**: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" IF is known to disproportionate in water: 5 IF + 3 H2O → 2 I2 + HIO3 + 5 HF. This produces two iodine-containing substances (I2 and HIO3). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Let's reconsider the \"colorless\" clue. It's possible the clue is flawed, or refers to something else. Let's check other possibilities for A4. What if A4 = IF5? IF5 is a colorless liquid, which fits the description. The reaction would be I2 + IF5 -> A5 (1:1), where A5 would be a mixed-valence species I3F5. This is plausible. So A4 could be IF5.\n\n5.  **Determine A4 by its Molecular Weight.**\n    We have two main candidates for A4: IF3 and IF5. Let's calculate their molecular weights and check the given options.\n    *   M(IF3) = 126.9 + 3 * 19.0 = 183.9 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the ranges (it's close to range B: 160-180, but outside it).\n    *   M(IF5) = 126.9 + 5 * 19.0 = 221.9 g/mol. This value falls perfectly into range **C) 220-240**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The hypothesis that Y=I and A4=IF5 is the most consistent one. It fits the molecular weight range perfectly, and IF5 is a colorless liquid, matching the description of the solution of A4. While there are inconsistencies in the problem description (the color of A1, the slight inaccuracy of the mass % for A2=IF3), the identification of A4=IF5 is strongly supported by its molecular weight and physical properties.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (IF5) is ~222 g/mol. This falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and compound A2 using the given mass percentage.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) being 31.96%.\nThe formula for A2 can be written as YF_n.\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\nWhere M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * n = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = (19.00 - 6.0724) * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow, we test small integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible molar mass M(Y) that corresponds to a known element.\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (This is close to Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (This is close to Bromine, but its fluorides don't match the problem description well).\n*   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol).\n*   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No common element matches).\n*   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Close to Mercury or Thallium, but their fluoride chemistry is not extensive enough).\n*   If n = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (This is very close to Plutonium, Pu, with an atomic mass around 244 g/mol).\n\nLet's verify the two best candidates, Sb and Pu.\n*   For Y=Sb, A2 = SbF3. M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (31.88%). This is very close to the given 31.96%.\n*   For Y=Pu, A2 = PuF6. M(PuF6) = 244 + 6 * 19.00 = 358 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (6 * 19.00) / 358 = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%). This is also very close.\n\nHowever, many of the qualitative descriptions in the problem (e.g., \"colorless concentrated solution of A4\") fit the chemistry of antimony (whose fluorides are colorless) better than that of plutonium (whose compounds are characteristically colored). Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF5, is also a known agent that can oxidize xenon. While there are inconsistencies in the problem statement for any choice, the numerical evidence for Sb is slightly stronger, and the qualitative clues also point towards it. So, we will proceed with the hypothesis that **Y = Sb**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the possible compounds A4.**\nIf Y is Antimony (Sb), its common binary fluorides are Antimony(III) fluoride (SbF3) and Antimony(V) fluoride (SbF5). Therefore, substance A4 must be one of these two compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weights of the possible compounds for A4.**\n*   Molecular Weight of SbF3: M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n*   Molecular Weight of SbF5: M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the calculated molecular weights with the given options.**\nThe question asks to indicate the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls.\nThe options are:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nLet's check our calculated values:\n*   The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls within the range **160-180 g/mol**.\n*   The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges. It is close to range B, but it is not within it.\n\nBased on this, A4 must be SbF3. The molecular weight of A4 falls in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n*(Note: The problem contains several statements that are contradictory or factually incorrect, regardless of the choice of element Y. However, by focusing on the quantitative data provided—the mass percentage and the final options for molecular weight—we can arrive at the most plausible intended answer.)*\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the mass percentage of A2.**\n    Let the chemical formula of A2 be YFₓ, where Y is the unknown element and x is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is given as 31.96% or 0.3196.\n    The formula for the mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (x * Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + x * Molar Mass of F)\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\n    Let's rearrange the formula to solve for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19x) = 19x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724x = 19x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19x - 6.0724x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276x\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    Now we test integer values for x (which represents the oxidation state of Y) to find a plausible element.\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Calcium, Argon). Calcium fluoride is CaF₂, not CaF. No noble gas fluoride fits.\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, Selenium). Bromine fluorides are known, but the properties don't match well.\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Antimony, Sb). SbF₃ has ɷF = (3\\*19)/(121.76+57) ≈ 31.88%. This is a close match.\n    *   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Dysprosium, Dy). DyF₄ has ɷF = (4\\*19)/(162.5+76) ≈ 31.86%. This is also a very close match.\n    *   If x = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Bismuth, Bi). BiF₅ has ɷF = (5\\*19)/(208.98+95) ≈ 31.25%. This is not a good match.\n\n    We have two strong candidates: Antimony (Sb) and Dysprosium (Dy).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates using the other chemical properties.**\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: Y = Antimony (Sb)**\n        A2 would be SbF₃. The problem states that A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine (A1 -> SbF₃ + F₂). This means A1 would have a higher oxidation state, likely SbF₅. However, A1 is described as bright-red, while SbF₅ is a colorless liquid. This is a contradiction. Therefore, Y is unlikely to be Antimony.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: Y = Dysprosium (Dy)**\n        A2 would be DyF₄. This is a known, though unstable, fluoride of dysprosium.\n        *   **A1:** Decomposes to A2 (DyF₄) and F₂. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride, like a hypothetical DyF₅ or DyF₆. A bright-red, highly unstable, powerfully oxidizing compound is plausible for a high-oxidation state lanthanide fluoride. It oxidizing xenon fits this picture.\n        *   **A3:** Obtained by fluorinating Dy, also interacts with xenon. DyF₄ fits this description as it is a strong oxidizer.\n        *   **A4 & A5:** The key reaction is `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio. For Y=Dy, this is `Dy + A4 -> A5`. This stoichiometry strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction, where an element in different oxidation states reacts to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state. The known oxidation states of Dysprosium are +2, +3, and +4.\n        The reaction `Dy(0) + Dy(IV)F₄ -> 2 Dy(II)F₂` perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio of reactants (Y and A4) and produces a single substance (A5).\n        Thus, it is highly probable that **A4 = DyF₄** and **A5 = DyF₂**.\n        *   **A5 Check:** The problem states that A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. DyF₂ contains Dy(II), which is a powerful reducing agent. It would react with water, for example: `2 DyF₂ + 2 H₂O -> 2 DyF₃ + H₂`. This produces two substances (Dysprosium(III) fluoride and hydrogen gas), which is consistent with the problem description.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, substance A4 is Dysprosium tetrafluoride (DyF₄).\n    *   Molar Mass of Dysprosium (Dy) ≈ 162.5 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (DyF₄) = M(Dy) + 4 * M(F) = 162.5 + 4 * 19.0 = 162.5 + 76.0 = 238.5 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 238.5 g/mol. We now check which of the given ranges this value falls into:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The value 238.5 g/mol is within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, n is the number of fluorine atoms, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (approx. 19.00 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWe are given ɷF = 31.96% = 0.3196. We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\nM(Y) = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\nWe need to find an element Y and an integer n that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for n:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (fits Ca, K, Sc - these do not typically form five binary fluorides or fit the other chemical properties).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (fits Br, Se - Bromine has 3 common fluorides, Selenium has 3).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits).\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (somewhat close to Bi, Hg).\n*   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (fits Plutonium, Pu=244 g/mol).\n\nLet's check the most promising candidates, Sb and Pu, with a more precise calculation.\n\n**Candidate 1: Antimony (Sb)**\nIf Y = Sb and n = 3, then A2 = SbF3.\nM(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\nɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 18.998 / 178.754) * 100% = 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n\n**Candidate 2: Plutonium (Pu)**\nIf Y = Pu and n = 6, then A2 = PuF6.\nM(PuF6) = 244 + 6 * 18.998 = 357.988 g/mol.\nɷF(PuF6) = (6 * 18.998 / 357.988) * 100% = 31.84%. This is also very close.\n\nHowever, when we check the molecular weights of possible compounds against the given answer ranges, plutonium fluorides (PuF3 ≈ 301, PuF4 ≈ 320, PuF6 ≈ 358) do not fit at all. This strongly suggests Y = Antimony (Sb).\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct the scenario with Y = Antimony (Sb).**\n\n*   **Y = Sb**. The problem states five binary compounds are known. The two major ones are SbF3 and SbF5. Other, less stable or polymeric species may be considered to reach five for the context of this problem.\n*   **A2 = SbF3**. This is based on the excellent match of the fluorine mass percentage.\n*   **A1**: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine\". This implies the reaction A1 -> SbF3 + F2. For this to happen, A1 must be a higher fluoride than SbF3, which would be SbF5. So, **A1 = SbF5**. There is a known contradiction here: SbF5 is a colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid, and it's thermally stable. We must assume these properties are either incorrect or refer to an obscure, reactive form within the problem's context.\n*   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\". The fluorination of Sb can yield SbF3 or SbF5. The ability to interact with xenon (a hallmark of very strong Lewis acids or oxidizing agents) points definitively to **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. A4 must be one of the antimony fluorides, likely SbF3 or SbF5, as they are the main ones. Both are colorless.\n\n**Step 3: Determine A4 by calculating molecular weights and comparing with the given ranges.**\n\nWe need to find the molecular weight of A4. The most plausible candidates for A4 are SbF3 and SbF5. Let's calculate their molecular weights.\n*   **Molar Mass of SbF3**: M = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   **Molar Mass of SbF5**: M = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nNow, let's compare these values with the given answer ranges:\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\n*   The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range **A) 160-180**.\n*   The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well in any range. It is close to range D, but outside of it.\n\nThis provides strong evidence that **A4 is SbF3**.\n\nThe final parts of the problem describe the formation of A5 (Sb + SbF3 -> A5) and its subsequent decomposition in water. This describes a comproportionation reaction to form a subfluoride (A5), which would then disproportionate upon hydrolysis. This is chemically complex but does not contradict the identification of A4 based on its molecular weight.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n    We are given that compound A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF = 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × n × 19.00 = n × 19.00\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = n × 19.00 × (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = n × 19.00 × 0.6804\n    M(Y) ≈ n × (12.9276 / 0.3196)\n    M(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\n    We now test integer values for n, which corresponds to the oxidation state of element Y.\n    *   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Bromine, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't align).\n    *   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol. This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No suitable element).\n    *   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Close to Hg or Tl, but less likely based on subsequent clues).\n\n    Let's verify our choice. If Y = Sb and n = 3, then A2 is SbF₃.\n    Let's calculate the precise mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ (using M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol and M(F) = 18.998 g/mol):\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n    ɷF = (3 × 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compounds A1 and A3**\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 must be a fluoride of antimony with a higher oxidation state. The most stable and common higher fluoride is Antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅. So, **A1 = SbF₅**.\n    *   The problem states A1 oxidizes xenon. SbF₅ is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, known to react with xenon. This further supports A1 = SbF₅.\n    *   A3 is obtained by direct fluorination of element Y (Sb) and it also reacts with xenon. Fluorination of antimony can yield SbF₃ or SbF₅. Since A3 reacts with xenon, it must be the strong oxidizer, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5**\n    *   A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. Let's consider the hydrolysis of SbF₃ (our compound A2).\n        SbF₃ + H₂O → SbOF↓ + 2HF(aq)\n        This reaction produces two distinct substances: antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). This perfectly matches the description. Thus, it is highly likely that **A5 = SbF₃**.\n    *   Now, let's look at the formation of A5. It is obtained by adding element Y (Sb) to a solution of A4.\n        Reaction: Sb + A4 → A5 (which is SbF₃)\n        The reaction is: Sb⁰ + A4 → Sb⁺³F₃.\n    *   This is a comproportionation reaction. Antimony in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) is oxidized to +3. For this to happen, A4 must contain antimony in a higher oxidation state that gets reduced to +3. The only common higher fluoride is SbF₅. Therefore, **A4 = SbF₅**.\n    *   The chemical reaction is: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. While the problem states a 1:1 molar ratio, this is likely an error in the problem statement, as is common in complex descriptive problems. The chemical transformation itself is the crucial clue.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n    We have confidently identified A4 as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). Now we calculate its molecular weight.\n    M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n    M(F) = 18.998 g/mol\n    Molecular Weight of A4 (SbF₅) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F) = 121.76 + 5 × 18.998 = 121.76 + 94.99 = **216.75 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range**\n    We need to find the range in which the molecular weight of 216.75 g/mol falls.\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The calculated value of 216.75 g/mol does not fit exactly into any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to range C. The difference between our calculated value and the lower bound of range C is only 220 - 216.75 = 3.25. This small discrepancy suggests that C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the composition of substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YFz) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    Let My be the molar mass of element Y and Mf be the molar mass of fluorine (19.00 g/mol).\n    The formula for the mass percentage is: ɷF = (z * Mf) / (My + z * Mf)\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    0.3196 = (z * 19.00) / (My + z * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * My + 0.3196 * 19.00 * z = 19.00 * z\n    0.3196 * My + 6.0724 * z = 19.00 * z\n    0.3196 * My = 12.9276 * z\n    My = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * z\n    My ≈ 40.45 * z\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer z (the number of fluorine atoms) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for z:\n    *   z=1: My ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This corresponds to Argon or Calcium, which are not known to form the described range of fluorides.\n    *   z=2: My ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (79.9 g/mol) or Selenium (79.0 g/mol). Bromine is a halogen itself, and its fluorides don't match the description. Selenium forms SeF4 and SeF6, not five compounds.\n    *   z=3: My ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol. This is a very strong candidate. Let's assume **Y=Sb** and **A2=SbF3**.\n    *   z=4: My ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is close to Terbium (158.9 g/mol) or Dysprosium (162.5 g/mol).\n    *   z=5: My ≈ 202.25 g/mol. This is near Gold (197.0), Mercury (200.6), or Bismuth (209.0).\n    *   z=6: My ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This matches the isotope Plutonium-242. However, solutions of plutonium compounds are known to be colored, which contradicts a later clue (\"colorless concentrated solution of A4\").\n\n2.  **Verify the mass percentage for A2=SbF3.**\n    MW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188, or 31.88%.\n    This value (31.88%) is very close to the given value of 31.96%, confirming that Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 is a highly probable identification.\n\n3.  **Identify the other compounds based on Y=Sb.**\n    The known binary fluorides of antimony are SbF3 and SbF5. The problem states five compounds are known, which is a discrepancy. However, given the strong numerical match for Sb, we'll proceed by assuming the problem may be flawed in this descriptive detail or counts polymeric forms.\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2(SbF3) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride, so **A1=SbF5**. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" does not match the known properties of SbF5 (colorless, stable liquid/solid). This is another likely flaw in the problem statement.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y(Sb) and reacts with Xenon. This can be SbF5. SbF5 is a powerful Lewis acid and reacts with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF2 + SbF5 → [XeF]+[SbF6]−). So, **A3=SbF5**.\n\n4.  **Identify substance A4.**\n    The problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   A4 is a fluoride of Antimony, so it is either SbF3 or SbF5.\n    *   Both SbF3 and SbF5 can form colorless solutions (e.g., in anhydrous HF).\n    *   The question is to find the molecular weight range of A4. Let's calculate the MW for both possibilities and check against the options.\n        *   **MW(SbF3)** = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n        *   **MW(SbF5)** = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Check the molecular weights against the given ranges.**\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 220-240\n    *   D) 160-180\n\n    *   The MW of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely in range **D) 160-180**.\n    *   The MW of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit any of the ranges.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the strong numerical evidence, Y is Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF3. The only fluoride of antimony whose molecular weight fits one of the given ranges is SbF3. Therefore, **A4 must be SbF3**.\n    The reaction described (Sb + SbF3 → A5) is chemically problematic, as is the description of A1. However, given the multiple-choice format, the numerical coherence between the mass percentage of A2 and the molecular weight of A4 provides the only logical path to a unique answer among the options.\n\n    The molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is 178.76 g/mol, which lies in the range 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe step-by-step reasoning has been completed, and the calculations were verified by the python script.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y**: Based on the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF=31.96%) in compound A2 (YFₙ), we set up the equation M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n. Testing integer values for n, n=3 gives M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol, which is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, M ≈ 121.76 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Identify A2**: With Y=Sb and n=3, compound A2 is Antimony trifluoride, SbF₃. The code output confirms the mass fraction of fluorine in SbF₃ is ~31.88%, which is very close to the given value of 31.96%.\n\n3.  **Identify A1 and A3**: A1 decomposes to A2 (SbF₃) and F₂, implying it's a higher fluoride. A1 also oxidizes Xenon. Both properties point to A1 being Antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅. Since A3 is also formed by fluorinating Sb and reacts with Xenon, A3 is also SbF₅.\n\n4.  **Identify A4**: A4 is a binary fluoride of Antimony, so the main candidates are SbF₃ and SbF₅. We need to find its molecular weight range.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF₃ = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF₅ = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match with Options**: We compare these molecular weights with the given ranges:\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 160-180\n\nThe molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls within the range 160-180. The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.75 g/mol) does not fit any range. Therefore, A4 must be SbF₃.\n\nThe question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls. Since A4 is SbF₃ with a molecular weight of approximately 178.8 g/mol, it falls into the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the information about compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YFₓ) with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). We can set up an equation to find the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) in terms of x, the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic mass of fluorine (M(F)) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\nSolving for M(Y):\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00x) = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724x = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276x\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nWe need to find an integer `x` for which `40.45 * x` corresponds to the molar mass of a known element.\n\n*   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest is Calcium, Ca=40.08)\n*   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (Closest is Bromine, Br=79.90)\n*   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Closest is Antimony, Sb=121.76)\n*   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (Closest is Dysprosium, Dy=162.50)\n*   If x = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Closest is Bismuth, Bi=208.98 or Mercury, Hg=200.59)\n*   If x = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.70 g/mol (Closest is Plutonium, Pu=244 or Americium, Am=243)\n\n**Step 2: Use other clues to identify Element Y and its fluorides.**\n\nWe have several other important pieces of information:\n1.  **Five binary compounds** of Y and F are known.\n2.  **A1 is bright-red**, decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and F₂, and oxidizes xenon (Xe) under normal conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidates for Y from Step 1:\n*   **Bromine (Br)**: Forms BrF, BrF₃, BrF₅ (3 compounds, not 5). Rule out.\n*   **Antimony (Sb)**: Forms SbF₃, SbF₅ (2 compounds, not 5). Rule out.\n*   **Plutonium (Pu)**: A good candidate from the mass calculation (M(Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol for x=6). PuF₆ is a strong oxidizing agent (can oxidize Xe) and is reddish-brown (\"bright-red\" is plausible). It decomposes to PuF₄ and F₂. However, only three binary fluorides of Pu are well-known (PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₆), not five.\n*   Let's check the element that is most famous for having five binary fluorides: **Uranium (U)**. The known binary fluorides are UF₃, UF₄, U₂F₉ (or UF₄.₅), UF₅, and UF₆. This fits the \"five compounds\" clue perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Verify if Y = Uranium fits the scenario.**\n\n*   **A2 = UF₆**: Let's check the mass fraction of F in UF₆. M(U) ≈ 238 g/mol.\n    ɷF(UF₆) = (6 * 19) / (238 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 352 = 0.3238 or 32.38%.\n    This is very close to the given 31.96%. The small discrepancy (~1.3% relative error) is common in such problems due to rounding of atomic masses. So, we can confidently identify **A2 as UF₆**.\n\n*   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (UF₆) and F₂. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride than UF₆. No stable binary uranium fluoride above UF₆ is known. However, the problem describes A1 as highly unstable (\"decomposes at 293 K\"). Also, A1 is \"bright-red\" and oxidizes Xe under \"normal conditions\". This description perfectly matches **Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**.\n    *   KrF₂ is one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known and readily oxidizes Xe.\n    *   It decomposes slowly at room temperature (293 K).\n    *   Some reports describe solid KrF₂ as having a reddish appearance at low temperatures.\n    The reaction is a complex fluorination, not a simple decomposition:\n    U + 3 KrF₂ → UF₆ + 3 Kr\n    Although A1 (KrF₂) is not a compound of Y, it is the reagent used to produce A2 (UF₆). The wording \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine\" might be a slightly simplified or misleading description of a complex reaction where KrF₂ acts as a fluorine source to create UF₆. Given the other constraints, this is the most logical interpretation.\n\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Y with fluorine, and it can interact with Xenon.\n    Y + F₂ → A3. A3 interacts with Xe.\n    U + 3F₂ → UF₆. As established, UF₆ (A2) can react with Xe, so A3 could be UF₆. This aligns.\n\n**Step 4: Identify A4 and A5.**\n\n*   We are given the reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** (in a 1:1 molar ratio, in a hot concentrated solution).\n*   In our case: **U + A4 → A5**\n*   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n\nLet's consider the possible identities of A4 and A5 from the known chemistry of uranium fluorides. A common reaction in aqueous uranium chemistry involves the disproportionation of U(V) compounds or comproportionation reactions.\nA key reaction involves the uranyl ion, (UO₂)²⁺. Let's consider A4 to be an aqueous acid of the uranyl ion. The most common is Uranyl fluoride, UO₂F₂ dissolved in hydrofluoric acid (HF). Uranyl fluoride itself is a colorless substance in solution.\nSo, let's assume **A4 is UO₂F₂**.\n\nThe reaction is:\nU + UO₂F₂ (+ other reagents, likely HF) → A5\n\nA known comproportionation reaction is:\nU(s) + UO₂²⁺(aq) + 4H⁺(aq) → 2U⁴⁺(aq) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nIf we use hydrofluoric acid, the product U⁴⁺ will precipitate as UF₄ (uranium tetrafluoride).\nLet's check the stoichiometry:\nU + UO₂F₂ + 4HF → 2UF₄ + 2H₂O\nThis is a balanced reaction. Here, Y (U) and A4 (UO₂F₂) react in a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction.\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe solution likely contains more than just A4. Let's assume A4 is a uranium compound where uranium is in a +6 oxidation state, like UF₆ or UO₂F₂. The element Y is uranium in oxidation state 0. They react to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state. A5 decomposes in water. This is characteristic of U(V) compounds.\n\nA plausible reaction involves forming a U(V) complex:\nU(0) + UF₆ (in HF solution) → Formation of U(V) species.\nHowever, a more direct comproportionation is:\nU(0) + 3UF₆ → 4UF₄(V) -> this is incorrect.\nU(IV) + U(VI) -> 2U(V). Example: UF₄ + UF₆ -> 2UF₅\nThis doesn't involve element Y (Uranium metal).\n\nLet's go back to the aqueous chemistry involving uranyl ions.\nPerhaps A4 is nitric acid, HNO₃, a colorless concentrated solution. Uranyl nitrate UO₂(NO₃)₂ is formed, which is colorless to pale yellow. This doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's stick with the most plausible candidate for an aqueous uranium(VI) solution: **UO₂F₂ in HF**. The stoichiometry might be complex. The key information is that **A4 is a colorless solution containing a uranium(VI) compound**. UO₂F₂ is the most logical choice.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n\nWe have identified A4 as Uranyl Fluoride, UO₂F₂.\nLet's calculate its molecular weight:\nM(U) ≈ 238.03 g/mol\nM(O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\nM(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight (MW) of UO₂F₂ = M(U) + 2 * M(O) + 2 * M(F)\nMW = 238.03 + 2 * 16.00 + 2 * 19.00\nMW = 238.03 + 32.00 + 38.00\nMW = **308.03 g/mol**\n\nThis falls into none of the given ranges. Let me re-check my deductions. Everything points strongly to Uranium. The A4 identification seems the most likely weak point.\n\nLet's revisit the core, confirmed facts: Y=U, A2=UF₆.\nWhat else could A4 be? \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". Y is added to it.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nU + A4 -> A5\n\nMaybe A4 is a non-uranium compound? This is unlikely, given the context. The problem revolves around the compounds of Y.\nLet's rethink the reaction.\nA5 decomposes in water into two substances.\nWhat if A4 is a U(IV) compound, and it gets reduced? Unlikely.\nWhat if the reaction is not aqueous? \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This could mean a non-aqueous solvent.\nFor example, UF₆ can be dissolved in anhydrous HF. This solution is colorless.\nReaction: U + UF₆ (in HF) -> A5.\nThis reaction does not proceed in a simple 1:1 stoichiometry to a single product.\n\nThere might be an error in my reasoning or the problem statement has a twist. Let's reconsider all fluorides of uranium as A4.\n- UF₃: black/purple solid.\n- UF₄: green solid.\n- U₂F₉: black solid.\n- UF₅: blue/gray solid.\n- UF₆: colorless solid, sublimes. A solution in HF is colorless.\n- UO₂F₂: colorless in solution.\nIf \"solution of A4\" implies that A4 is the solute, both UF₆ and UO₂F₂ are candidates.\nMW(UF₆) = 352.03 g/mol.\nMW(UO₂F₂) = 308.03 g/mol.\nNeither fit the ranges perfectly.\n\nLet's re-examine the given answer ranges:\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nCould Y be a different element? The \"five fluorides\" points overwhelmingly to Uranium. The mass calculation for A2 fits UF₆ well. The properties of A1 are tricky but can be reconciled. It's highly probable that Y=Uranium.\n\nLet's think of another compound for A4. What if the description \"colorless concentrated solution\" is key. A solution of Uranium(IV) fluoride, UF₄, in certain complexing agents can be colorless. But UF₄ itself is a green solid.\n\nThere must be a compound of Uranium whose mass is in one of those ranges.\nLet's check Uranium oxides, chlorides, etc.\n- UO₃: 238 + 3*16 = 286\n- UO₂: 238 + 2*16 = 270\n- UCl₄: 238 + 4*35.5 = 238 + 142 = 380\n- UCl₆: 238 + 6*35.5 = 238 + 213 = 451\n\nThere is another possibility. The \"Y\" in the final reaction \"Y+A4->A5\" might not be the element Uranium, but one of its compounds, like UF₄. This contradicts the problem stating \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio...\".\n\nLet's reconsider the mass of Y. What if the given ɷF=31.96% for A2=YFₓ is exact?\nFrom M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x:\n- x=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8\n- x=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3\n- x=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 (closest is Pu)\n\nLet's try Y = Neptunium (Np, M=237). Np is between U and Pu.\nɷF(NpF₆) = (6*19)/(237+114) = 114/351 = 32.47%. Still very close to ɷF(UF₆).\nNp also has multiple fluorides (NpF₃, NpF₄, NpF₆). Not five.\n\nThe evidence for Y=Uranium remains the strongest. Let's assume A4 is a simple, common compound that has been missed.\nLet's look for a Uranium compound with MW in the range 220-240.\nThis would have to be U + (something with negative mass) or a very light adduct. This is impossible.\n\nLet's rethink \"binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\". What if Y is not a metal? What if Y=Iodine?\nIodine (I, M=126.9). Forms IF, IF₃, IF₅, IF₇. Four compounds, close to five.\nLet's check mass fractions. A2=IFₓ, ɷF=31.96%\nM(I)=126.9. M(Y)= (x*19/0.3196) - 19x = 40.45x\n126.9 = 40.45x -> x=3.13. Close to x=3.\nLet's check ɷF(IF₃) = (3*19)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 = 31.0%. Close to 31.96%.\nSo, maybe Y=Iodine and A2=IF₃.\nA1 decomposes to A2(IF₃) + F₂ -> A1=IF₅.\nLet's check properties of IF₅: Colorless liquid. Doesn't fit \"bright-red\".\nSo Y is not Iodine.\n\nThe entire logical chain leads back to Uranium. There must be an interpretation of A4 that gives a MW in one of the ranges.\nLet's try one more time. Is there any other Uranium compound? What about Uranium(IV) borohydride U(BH₄)₄? MW = 238 + 4*(10.8+4) = 238 + 59.2 = 297.2. No.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: U(metal) + A4 -> A5.\nMaybe A4 is an oxoacid?\nH₂SO₄? HNO₃? HClO₄? These are all colorless.\nU + HNO₃ -> UO₂(NO₃)₂. A4 would be HNO₃, MW=63. Not in range.\nU + HClO₄ -> .... complex. MW(HClO₄) = 100.5.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and A4 is **Uranium trioxide, UO₃**.\nMW = 238 + 3*16 = 286. Still not in range.\nHow about **Uranium(IV) oxide, UO₂**? MW = 238 + 32 = 270.\nMaybe the question meant \"atomic weight of Y\"? M(U)=238, which is in the range 220-240. But it asks for MW of A4.\n\nLet's assume the question and ranges are correct and my identification of Y is wrong, despite the strong evidence.\nLet A4's MW be `M`.\n- A) M ∈ [140, 160].\n- B) M ∈ [110, 130].\n- C) M ∈ [220, 240].\n- D) M ∈ [160, 180].\n\nLet's try Y=Tellurium (Te, M=127.6). It forms TeF₄, TeF₆, and Te₂F₁₀. Not five.\nCheck ɷF for TeF₄: (4*19)/(127.6+76) = 76/203.6 = 37.3%.\nCheck ɷF for TeF₆: (6*19)/(127.6+114) = 114/241.6 = 47.2%. Not a match.\n\nThe weight of evidence for Y=U is too strong to ignore. Let's reconsider the molecular weight calculation.\nMaybe A4 is UOCl₂? MW = 238 + 16 + 2*35.5 = 254+71 = 325. No.\nUranium(IV) chloride, UCl₄? MW = 380. No.\nUF₄? MW = 238 + 4*19 = 314. No.\nWhat if Y is Pu? M=244. PuF₄ MW=320.\nPuO₂ MW = 244 + 32 = 276.\n\nLet's take a leap of faith based on the strong evidence for Y=Uranium. M(U) ≈ 238 g/mol. The question asks for the molecular weight of A4. If A4 is somehow element Y itself, then its atomic weight is 238, which lies in the range 220-240. But A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\", which cannot be a solid metal. However, sometimes in abstract problems, terms are used loosely. For example, if A4 was meant to be the elementary substance Y, U-238, its molar mass fits range C.\nLet's see if this interpretation makes any sense.\nY + Y -> A5? This is nonsensical.\n\nLet's go back to the most likely candidate: UF₄. Maybe my calculation is wrong. M(U) is 238.0289. M(F) is 18.9984. UF₄ = 238.0289 + 4*18.9984 = 314.02. This is not in any range.\n\nLet's review the prompt. This appears to be a problem from a chemistry olympiad or a similar high-level competition. These problems are usually self-consistent. The convergence on Y=Uranium is very strong. Let's trust this and see if A4 can be found. The reaction U + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio) is the only piece of information about A4. A known reaction is UF₄ + UF₆ -> 2UF₅. This is a 1:1 reaction. Could Y be UF₄ and A4 be UF₆? This redefines Y mid-problem. That's not right.\n\nThere is a possibility that Y is not a single element but represents a group, but the term \"element Y\" contradicts this.\n\nLet's assume Y = Pu. Then A2 could be PuF₆. ɷF = (6*19)/(244+114) = 114/358 = 31.84%. This is an excellent match for 31.96%.\nSo, **Y = Plutonium (Pu)**.\nA1 decomposes to A2 (PuF₆) and F₂. Again, this suggests A1 is a higher fluoride, which isn't known. Or A1=PuF₆ and it decomposes to PuF₄+F₂. This would make A2=PuF₄. ɷF(PuF₄) = (4*19)/(244+76) = 76/320 = 23.75%. This is not 31.96%.\nSo, A2 must be PuF₆. This means A1 decomposes to PuF₆ + F₂. The only way this works is if it's not a simple decomposition, similar to the KrF₂ + U -> UF₆ + Kr scenario.\n\nLet's proceed with Y=Pu, A2=PuF₆.\n- Five binary compounds of Pu and F? No, only three are known. This is a major contradiction.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, the Uranium hypothesis with the five fluorides seems more robust, even with the small mass fraction discrepancy for UF₆. The most likely source of error is either in the description of the reaction for A4 or A4 itself is an unusual compound. Let's reconsider the molecular weight of Uranium itself: 238 g/mol. It falls in range C. If A4 is a placeholder name for the Y substance used as a reagent, this might be the intended answer, however strange the phrasing.\nIf A4 = UF₆, MW = 352.\nIf A4 = UO₂F₂, MW = 308.\nIf A4 = UF₄, MW = 314.\nIf A4 = UF₅, MW = 333.\nNone of these fit the provided options.\n\nThere must be another compound. What about uranium peroxide, UO₄·2H₂O? This compound is pale yellow. MW = 238 + 4*16 + 2*18 = 302 + 36 = 338.\nThere is no clear path to a compound that fits one of the molecular weight ranges. Let's reconsider the mass calculation. Perhaps x=4? M(Y) = 161.8. No element fits well.\n\nLet's assume the question implies Y is Iodine, since it is a well-known element forming many interhalogen compounds.\nY=I, A2=IF₃. A1=IF₅.\nI + A4 -> A5 (1:1). A5 decomposes in water. A4 is colorless.\nA possible reaction: I₂ + 5F₂ -> 2IF₅.\nA3 is obtained by fluorination: I₂ + F₂ -> 2IF. A3=IF. It can interact with Xe to form complexes.\nSo far, plausible except for the color of A1(IF₅) being colorless, not red.\nWhat could A4 be? Let's check iodine compounds.\nHI: MW=128 (in range B). HIO₃: MW=176 (in range D). HIO₄: MW=192 (not in range).\nReaction: I + HIO₃ -> ? In a 1:1 molar ratio, this could be the comproportionation reaction: 5I⁻ + IO₃⁻ + 6H⁺ -> 3I₂ + 3H₂O. Not Y + A4.\nMaybe I₂ + I₂O₅ -> I₂O₃+I₂O₂ ?\n\nThis path is not yielding a clear result and has contradictions. The Uranium path is the most coherent despite the issues with A4's identity. The atomic mass of Uranium (238 g/mol) falls in range C (220-240). Given the high probability that Y is Uranium and the ambiguity/potential error in the description of A4 and its reaction, it is a strong possibility that the question is indirectly asking for a property of Y itself. If A4 is a simple compound of Y, its mass would be M(Y) + other atoms, so M(A4) > M(Y) = 238. Thus A4 should be >238. None of the ranges A, B, D work. Range C is the only one that is even close to the scale of M(Y). If we assume A4 = UO₂ (Uranium dioxide), its mass is 270 g/mol, outside of C.\n\nLet's go with the Pu=Y hypothesis again, as the mass calculation is a better fit. Y=Pu, A2=PuF₆. We must ignore the \"five fluorides\" rule. A1 oxidizes Xe, reddish -> PuF₆. Okay. A3 fluorination product that interacts with Xe -> PuF₆. A5 from Pu + A4. A4 is a colorless solution. PuF₄ is pinkish. Plutonyl solutions (PuO₂²⁺) are pink-orange. Only Pu³⁺ is blue/violet. It's hard to find a colorless solution for A4. But if we ignore that, maybe A4=PuO₂? MW=276. Out of range. Maybe A4 = PuCl₃? MW = 244 + 3*35.5 = 349.5. No.\n\nThe most plausible scenario remains Y=U. The discrepancy in F% is small. The five fluorides rule is unique. The difficulty is in A4. If we are forced to choose an answer, and knowing Y=U, the only mass range that is \"in the ballpark\" for a heavy element like Uranium is C. If we hypothesize that A4 is an obscure or misdescribed compound, whose mass happens to fall in that range, this is a possible path. There is no simple, common uranium compound that fits the mass range. But the identity of Y=Uranium is the most solid conclusion from the premises. Based on this, it's a process of elimination on the MW ranges. A compound of U will be heavy. A, B, and D are too light. A compound of U could plausibly be in range C, for example, if it were something like UF₂ (hypothetical), MW=238+38=276, still outside. Or UO (hypothetical), MW=238+16=254. Again outside. The range C contains the atomic mass of Y itself. This might be a hint.\n\nLet's choose C, based on the high likelihood that Y is Uranium, and range C is the only plausible range for the mass of a heavy element compound (or the element itself).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that compound A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YF_n) and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    Let M_Y be the molar mass of element Y and M_F be the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * 19.00 * n = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = (19.00 - 6.0724) * n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 12.9276 * n\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We need to find an integer `n` that results in a realistic atomic mass M_Y for an element Y that can form multiple fluorides.\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but its fluorides don't match the %F).\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, but its chemistry doesn't fit, as we'll see).\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (several heavy elements are nearby, but the fit is less precise).\n    *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Plutonium, but its fluoride chemistry creates contradictions with the problem statement).\n\n    Let's verify the %F for A2 = SbF3.\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    %F = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 * 100% = 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a difference of only 0.08%.\n    So, we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** (Antimony) and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A3.**\n    A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Sb) with fluorine. It can also interact with xenon.\n    The reaction Sb + F2 (excess) -> SbF5. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is a very powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent. It is known to react with xenon or xenon fluorides to form complex salts like [XeF]+[SbF6]−.\n    Thus, **A3 = SbF5**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the remaining compounds and reactions.**\n    We have five compounds: A1, A2(SbF3), A3(SbF5), A4, A5.\n    The properties of A1 (bright-red, decomposes to SbF3 and F2 at room temperature) are problematic as SbF5 is colorless and stable. However, this information might be a distractor or refer to an obscure compound not needed to find A4. Let's proceed by focusing on the reaction involving A4.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound A4.**\n    The key information is: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n    Let's substitute what we know:\n    *   Y = Sb\n    *   Reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n    *   A4 is a binary fluoride of Antimony.\n    *   A5 disproportionates in water (this is implied by forming two substances from a single one, suggesting a compound with an unstable oxidation state).\n\n    We must identify A4. Let's consider the possible binary fluorides of antimony for A4 from the given options for its molecular weight.\n    *   A4 could be SbF3. Molar mass of SbF3 is ~178.76 g/mol. This falls perfectly within the range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   A4 could be SbF5. Molar mass of SbF5 is ~216.75 g/mol. This value is close to, but outside, the range A) 220-240.\n\n    Let's test the chemical plausibility of A4 being SbF3.\n    *   If A4 = SbF3, the reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(III)F3 -> A5 (1:1).\n    *   This is a reaction between an element in its 0 oxidation state and its +3 oxidation state. This could plausibly form a sub-valent or mixed-valence compound. Given the 1:1 stoichiometry, A5 would have the formula Sb2F3.\n    *   A compound like Sb2F3 would have an average oxidation state of +1.5 for Sb. Such compounds are expected to be unstable in water and disproportionate. For example:\n        `Sb2F3 + H2O -> Sb(s) + Sb(OH)3 + HF`\n        This reaction produces Antimony metal (Sb) and an Antimony(III) compound, which are \"two substances\". This fits the description perfectly.\n\n    Now, let's test the plausibility of A4 being SbF5.\n    *   If A4 = SbF5, the reaction is Sb(0) + Sb(V)F5 -> A5.\n    *   This is a classic comproportionation reaction. The known reaction is `Sb + 2SbF5 -> 3SbF3`. This is a 1:2 molar ratio, not the 1:1 ratio stated in the problem. This contradicts the problem's conditions.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The only option that is chemically consistent with all the reaction details (1:1 ratio, decomposition of A5) is that A4 is SbF3. The molecular weight of SbF3 is approximately 178.76 g/mol.\n\n    This value falls in the range **160-180**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nFive binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y are known. The key properties described, particularly for substance A1 (\"bright-red\", \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\"), strongly suggest that A1 is platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆), and therefore element Y is Platinum (Pt). Neil Bartlett's famous experiment in 1962 demonstrated that PtF₆, a deep-red solid, can oxidize xenon.\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis with the other clues:\n1.  **Element Y = Platinum (Pt)**. Platinum is known to form several binary fluorides, including PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆, so the existence of five compounds is plausible.\n\n2.  **Substance A1 = PtF₆**. It is a red solid and a powerful oxidizing agent capable of reacting with xenon. It is thermally unstable and decomposes upon heating. This perfectly matches the description of A1.\n\n3.  **Decomposition of A1**. \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2... and fluorine.\" The reaction is PtF₆ → A2 + F₂. A2 must be a lower fluoride of platinum, such as PtF₅ or PtF₄. The given mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (31.96%) does not perfectly match PtF₅ (32.7%) or PtF₄ (28.0%), suggesting a possible error in the problem's data. However, the qualitative chemical properties are a stronger guide. Let's assume A2 is PtF₅.\n\n4.  **Reaction to form A5**. \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   Y = Pt\n    *   The reaction is: Pt + A4 → A5 (with a 1:1 molar ratio between Pt and A4).\n    *   This describes a comproportionation reaction, where Pt in oxidation state 0 reacts with a platinum fluoride (A4, with Pt in a positive oxidation state) to form a platinum fluoride with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n    *   Let's test possible identities for A4, which must be a platinum fluoride. The reaction `Pt(0) + Pt(II)F₂ → 2Pt(I)F` or `Pt(0) + Pt(IV)F₄ → 2Pt(II)F₂` both have a 1:1 molar ratio between the reactants (Pt and the platinum fluoride A4).\n\n5.  **Calculate Molecular Weight of A4**. We need to find which candidate for A4 has a molecular weight that fits one of the given ranges.\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = PtF₄**. The reaction is `Pt + PtF₄ → 2PtF₂`. Here A5 is PtF₂.\n        Molar Mass (PtF₄) = M(Pt) + 4 * M(F) = 195.08 + 4 * 19.00 = 271.08 g/mol. This value does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = PtF₂**. The reaction is `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`. Here A5 is PtF.\n        Molar Mass (PtF₂) = M(Pt) + 2 * M(F) = 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = 233.08 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\nThis confirms that A4 is likely PtF₂. The other clues are consistent with this assignment: A5 would be PtF, which is a known but unstable compound that would readily decompose in water as stated.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) is 233.08 g/mol, which is in the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that for compound A2, the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\nThe formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\nwhere M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to find a relationship between M(Y) and the stoichiometric coefficient n:\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * n = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = (19.00 - 6.0724) * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\nM(Y) / n = 12.9276 / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45\n\nThis means the ratio of the atomic mass of element Y to the number of fluorine atoms in compound A2 is approximately 40.45.\n\nLet's test some plausible integer values for n against known elements:\n*   n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca or Ar, unlikely candidates).\n*   n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br).\n*   n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.3 g/mol (close to Sb).\n*   n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Tb or Dy).\n*   n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.2 g/mol (close to Hg, Tl, or Bi).\n*   n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Pu or Am).\n\nThe problem states that \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" This is a very strong clue. We can search for elements known to form this many fluorides. Uranium (U) is a prime candidate, forming UF3, UF4, U2F9, UF5, and UF6. Let's check if Uranium fits the mass ratio.\n*   For Y=U (M=238.03 g/mol), the ratio M(Y)/n would require n = 238.03 / 40.45 ≈ 5.88. This is very close to 6.\nSo, we can hypothesize that **Y is Uranium (U)** and **A2 is Uranium Hexafluoride (UF6)**.\n\nLet's verify the other clues with Y=Uranium:\n*   **\"A1 is a bright-red substance\"**: The known uranium fluorides are not bright red (UF4 is green, UF5 is pale blue/gray, UF6 is colorless). This is a discrepancy. However, the rest of the clues might point strongly to Uranium, suggesting this might be an error in the problem description or a reference to an unusual state.\n*   **\"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (UF6) and fluorine\"**: This would mean `A1 -> UF6 + F2`. A1 would have to be a fluoride with a higher oxidation state than +6 (e.g., UF7), which is not a known stable compound. This is another major issue with the Uranium hypothesis based on this specific reaction.\n\nHowever, let's reconsider the mass calculation for another very close candidate. Plutonium (Pu, M ≈ 244 g/mol).\n*   For Y=Pu, n = 244 / 40.45 ≈ 6.03. This is an even better fit for n=6. Thus A2 could be PuF6. Let's calculate the theoretical ɷF for PuF6: M(PuF6) = 244 + 6*19 = 358 g/mol. ɷF = (114/358)*100% = 31.84%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n\nNow, let's check clues for Plutonium (Pu):\n*   **Five binary compounds**: Only PuF3, PuF4, and PuF6 are well-established. This contradicts the clue.\n*   **A1 color**: PuF6 is reddish-brown, which is much closer to \"bright-red\" than any uranium fluoride.\n*   **A1 decomposition**: The problem states `A1 -> A2 + F2`. If we assume A1=PuF6 (it is known to be unstable), it decomposes via `PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2`. This would make A2 = PuF4. The mass percentage of F in PuF4 is 23.75%, which does not match 31.96%.\n*   The conflict between the number of compounds and the chemical properties is significant. Given that the number of compounds is a very specific piece of data, and the mass percent calculation for UF6 is reasonably close, we will proceed with the **Y=Uranium** hypothesis, acknowledging the inconsistencies, which might be intentional misdirection or errors in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Compounds A1, A3, A4, A5**\n\nLet's assume Y = Uranium. The five compounds are UF3, UF4, U2F9, UF5, UF6.\n*   **A2 = UF6** (from Step 1).\n*   **A1**: Decomposes to A2 (UF6) + F2. As discussed, this is chemically problematic. For the sake of the puzzle, we move on. \"A1 oxidizes xenon\". Higher fluorides are strong oxidizers.\n*   **A3**: \"Can also interact with xenon\" and \"is obtained by fluorination of element Y\". Direct fluorination of Uranium metal can produce UF4, UF5, or UF6 depending on conditions. All are strong fluorinating agents.\n*   **A5**: Obtained via `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a comproportionation reaction: `U + UF_n -> 2UF_{n/2}`. For A5 to be one of the known binary fluorides (UFx), `n` must be an even integer and `x = n/2`.\n    *   If A4 = UF6 (n=6), then the reaction is `U + UF6 -> A5`. The product would be UF3.5 on average (`U2F7`), which isn't one of the five listed compounds. However, the reaction `U + 2UF6 -> 3UF4` is known but is not 1:1.\n    *   If **A4 = UF4** (n=4), the reaction is `U + UF4 -> A5`. This is a known reaction: `U + 3UF4 -> 4UF3` at high temperature, again not 1:1. However, if we interpret the 1:1 ratio as producing a compound with the average oxidation state, `U(0) + U(IV)F4 -> \"U(II)F2\"`. `UF2` is not a standard stable fluoride of Uranium.\n    *   Let's reconsider the products. If **A4 = UF6**, what if A5 is UF4? The balanced reaction is `U + 2UF6 -> 3UF4`. This is not 1:1. What if A5 is UF5? The reaction is `U + 4UF6 -> 5UF5`, also not 1:1.\n    *   Let's assume there is a simple reaction pathway not immediately obvious. The phrase \"in a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" is key. UF6 solutions (e.g., in HF) are generally colorless to pale yellow, and it is a powerful reagent. UF4 is a green solid and not readily soluble to form a concentrated solution. Therefore, **A4 is most likely UF6**.\n*   **A4 = UF6** (Uranium Hexafluoride).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on our deduction that A4 is UF6:\n*   Atomic mass of Uranium (U) ≈ 238.03 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular weight of UF6 = M(U) + 6 * M(F)\n*   Molecular weight of UF6 ≈ 238.03 + 6 * 19.00 = 238.03 + 114 = **352.03 g/mol**\n\nThis value, 352.03 g/mol, does not fall into any of the provided ranges (A, B, C, D). This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or a flawed premise. Let's revisit the prompt critically.\n\nPerhaps element Y is not Uranium. Let's re-examine the clue:\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe key might be \"colorless solution\".\nWhich element Y has fluorides that form colorless solutions, and one of them (A4) can react with Y?\nLet's consider **Y = Xenon (Xe)**.\nKnown binary fluorides: XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. (This contradicts the \"five compounds\" rule).\nProperties:\n*   All are colorless solids.\n*   They can be dissolved in anhydrous HF to form colorless solutions.\n*   The reaction `Xe + XeF4 -> 2XeF2` occurs at 400°C. This is a 1:1 molar reaction (`Y + A4 -> A5`).\nThis fits the clue perfectly. Let's assume A4=XeF4 and A5=XeF2.\nNow we must check if this fits the rest of the puzzle.\n*   **A2**: ɷF = 31.96%. M(Xe)/n = 131.29 / n ≈ 40.45 -> n ≈ 3.25. This doesn't fit neatly with XeF2, XeF4, or XeF6. This is a major contradiction.\n\n**Conclusion Re-evaluation**\n\nThere are contradictions in the problem statement, which is common in complex chemistry puzzles. The \"five binary compounds\" points very strongly to Uranium. The mass percentage calculation points to A2 being UF6 (or PuF6). The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` is difficult to reconcile with Uranium chemistry in a simple 1:1 ratio. The color of A1 (bright-red) and the colorless solution of A4 are also contradictory for Uranium fluorides (UF4 is green, UF6 is colorless solid but its solutions are not always colorless, and higher fluorides are reactive).\n\nLet's assume the question has an error and the answer lies with the most likely candidate despite contradictions. The Xenon hypothesis fails on the mass percentage. The Plutonium hypothesis fails on the number of compounds and the decomposition reaction's products. The Platinum hypothesis fails on the number of compounds and the colorless solution.\n\nThe Uranium hypothesis, despite its flaws, is the only one that satisfies the \"five binary compounds\" rule and has a plausible mass percentage fit. The most likely candidate for A4 (a substance that can be in solution and react with its parent element) within the uranium fluoride family would be the highest fluoride, UF6, used as a powerful reagent. Let's recalculate the molecular weight of UF6 and see if it's close to any range, perhaps using different isotopic masses. No, the standard atomic weight should be used. 352.03 g/mol is the value.\n\nThere seems to be a significant error in the problem statement or the provided options, as 352 g/mol is far from any of them. Let's rethink the `Y+A4 -> A5` reaction. What if it happens in a specific solvent where a complex is formed? For example, in BrF3, U metal reacts with the solvent.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem from a completely different angle. Maybe the element is **Tellurium (Te)**.\nFluorides: TeF4, Te2F10, TeF6. TeF6 is very stable. TeF4 can form a complex [TeF3]+. Not five compounds. Let's check mass ratio: M(Te)/n = 127.6/n = 40.45 -> n=3.15. No.\n\nGiven the irreconcilable contradictions, there must be a non-obvious interpretation or a faulty premise in the question. However, in such puzzles, one often has to choose the 'least wrong' path. The Uranium path, while having issues with color and reaction stoichiometry, is anchored by the \"five compounds\" clue. If we must identify A4, it would be one of the five Uranium fluorides. UF4 (MW = 314) and UF6 (MW = 352) are the most common. UF6 being a strong oxidizing agent used in solutions makes it a slightly better candidate for A4. Since 352 is far from the options, maybe A4 is not UF6. What if A4 is UF4? MW=314 g/mol. Still not in range. What about UF5? MW=333 g/mol. U2F9? MW=587 g/mol. UF3? MW=295 g/mol. None fit.\n\nThis suggests the element Y is incorrect. Let's go back to the python script output, which suggested an excellent candidate: Krypton.\n*   Y = Krypton (Kr). M = 83.8 g/mol.\n*   M/n = 83.8 / 2 = 41.9. This is close to 40.45.\n*   Let's check the mass percent in KrF2. M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 38 = 121.8 g/mol. ɷF = 38/121.8 = 31.2%. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\nLet's analyze Krypton based on the clues.\n1.  **Five compounds?** No, only KrF2 is well-established. KrF4 is debated. Contradiction.\n2.  **A1**: Red substance. No krypton fluoride is red. They are colorless. Contradiction.\n3.  **A1 decomp to A2+F2**: Maybe KrF4 (A1) -> KrF2 (A2) + F2.\n4.  **A1/A3 oxidizes Xe**: KrF2 is a very strong oxidizer, stronger than XeF2. It can oxidize xenon.\n5.  **A3 from Y+F2**: Kr + F2 -> KrF2. So A3 could be KrF2.\n6.  **Y+A4 -> A5**: Xe + A4 -> A5. Does not make sense with Y=Kr.\n\nThere is no element that cleanly fits all clues. The question is likely flawed. However, if forced to choose based on the given answer choices, let's work backward.\nAssume the answer is B) 220-240. What compound A4 has a MW in this range?\nIt must be a fluoride YF_n.\nIf n=4, M(YF4)=M(Y)+76 is in [220, 240]. M(Y) is in [144, 164]. Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy fit. DyF4 exists.\nIf n=5, M(YF5)=M(Y)+95 is in [220, 240]. M(Y) is in [125, 145]. Te, I, Xe, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd fit. PrF5, NdF5 are not standard.\nIf n=6, M(YF6)=M(Y)+114 is in [220, 240]. M(Y) is in [106, 126]. Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te, I. Only TeF6 is common.\nLet's check A4=TeF6. M(TeF6)=127.6+114=241.6 g/mol. This is in range B.\nLet's see if Y=Te works. Five compounds? No. M/n for A2 = 127.6/n = 40.45 -> n=3.15, not an integer.\n\nGiven the profound inconsistencies, a direct logical path to the answer is impossible. The question is flawed. There is no other recourse.\n\nFinal Attempt with a \"trick\": The description of the formation of A5 involves `Y + A4 -> A5`. This suggests a comproportionation. A parallel might be `I- + I2 -> I3-`. If Y=Iodine, Fluorides are IF, IF3, IF5, IF7. Four compounds, close to five. A4 could be IF5 (MW=221.9), which falls in range B. Let's check Y=Iodine.\n*   A2 = IFn. M(I)/n = 126.9/n = 40.45 -> n=3.13. So A2 is IF3.\n*   ɷF in IF3 = (3*19)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 = 30.99%. This is very close to 31.96%!\n*   So, Y=I, A2=IF3.\n*   A1 decomposes to A2(IF3)+F2. `A1 -> IF3 + F2`. So A1 must be a higher fluoride, like IF5 or IF7. Reaction: `IF5 -> IF3 + F2`. This happens at high temp. `IF7 -> IF5 + F2` is also known. A1 must be one of these. Neither is \"bright-red\".\n*   A3 from I2 + F2 -> A3. Can be IF5 or IF7.\n*   A4 is needed. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". IF5 is a colorless liquid at RT. IF7 is a colorless gas. So A4 is likely IF5.\n*   Let's check the molecular weight of A4=IF5. M(IF5) = 126.9 + 5*19 = 126.9 + 95 = **221.9 g/mol**.\n*   This molecular weight falls squarely in the range **B) 220-240**.\nThis fits almost all clues much better than any other element, with the main exception being the \"five compounds\" (Iodine has four) and the color of A1. This is the most consistent solution.\n\nFinal check of reaction: `Y + A4 -> A5`. `I2 + IF5 -> ?` (1:1 molar ratio of I to IF5). `I2` is two I atoms. This is `2I + IF5`. Unclear stoichiometry. However, it's possible the \"Y\" in the equation refers to an I atom, not I2 molecule.\n\nDespite minor flaws, the Iodine hypothesis is overwhelmingly the most coherent.\n\n**A4 = IF5, MW = 221.9 g/mol.**\n\nThis falls in the range **220-240**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n    Let the element be Y and its molar mass be M(Y). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\n    The mass fraction of fluorine (ωF) is given as 31.96% or 0.3196.\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (n * 19.00) = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (19.00 * 0.6804) / 0.3196\n    M(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\n    We can now test integer values of n to find a plausible element Y.\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, 40.08 g/mol). Calcium chemistry does not fit the problem's description (e.g., oxidizing xenon).\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, 79.9 g/mol, or Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb, 121.76 g/mol).\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (closest is Dy, 162.5 g/mol). Dysprosium chemistry does not fit.\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Hg, 200.6 g/mol, or Tl, 204.4 g/mol). Neither fits the reactive fluoride chemistry.\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (closest is Pu, 244 g/mol, or Am, 243 g/mol). Plutonium forms PuF6 and is a strong oxidizing agent.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates for Element Y.**\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu, n=6):** If Y=Pu, then A2 = PuF6.\n        Let's check the mass percentage: M(PuF6) = 244 + 6*19 = 358 g/mol. ωF = (6*19)/358 = 114/358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%). This is very close to the given 31.96%.\n        The problem states A1 oxidizes xenon, which PuF6 does. So, this is a strong candidate. However, we will see that none of Pu's fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6) have a molecular weight that falls into any of the given answer ranges. This rules out Plutonium.\n        *   MW(PuF3) ≈ 301 g/mol\n        *   MW(PuF4) ≈ 320 g/mol\n        *   MW(PuF6) ≈ 358 g/mol\n    *   **Antimony (Sb, n=3):** If Y=Sb, then A2 = SbF3.\n        Let's check the mass percentage: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol. ωF = (3*19)/178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (31.88%). This fit is also very good. Antimony forms SbF3 and SbF5. SbF5 is a strong oxidizer. A1 would be SbF5, but SbF5 is colorless, not \"bright-red\". A4 could be SbF3 (MW ≈ 179) or SbF5 (MW ≈ 217). SbF3's MW falls in range C. However, the reaction Sb + SbF3 -> A5 (1:1) has no plausible product, as there are no stable antimony fluorides with an oxidation state between 0 and +3. This rules out Antimony.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr, n=2):** If Y=Kr, then A2 = KrF2.\n        Let's check the mass percentage: M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8 g/mol. ωF = (2*19)/121.8 ≈ 0.312 (31.2%). This fit is less accurate but still plausible for a contest problem. Let's examine the chemical properties.\n\n3.  **Construct the chemical scenario with Y = Krypton.**\n    *   **Element Y:** Krypton (Kr).\n    *   **Compounds:** Known binary fluorides are mainly KrF2 and KrF4. The problem's \"five compounds\" is likely an exaggeration or includes unstable/ionic species, a common feature in such puzzles.\n    *   **A1:** \"decomposes... into A2 and fluorine\". If A2 is KrF2, then A1 must be KrF4. The reaction is KrF4 → KrF2 + F2. KrF4 does decompose when warmed. The \"bright-red\" description is a known inconsistency in this problem; KrF4 is a colorless solid. We assume it's a flaw in the problem statement.\n    *   **A2:** KrF2.\n    *   **A3:** \"obtained by fluorination of element Y... interacts with xenon\". The reaction Kr + F2 gives KrF2. KrF2 reacts with Xe. So, A3 = KrF2.\n    *   **The key reaction:** \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes a comproportionation reaction. If we take A4 = KrF4, the reaction is:\n        Kr + KrF4 → 2 KrF2\n        This reaction has a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants (Kr and KrF4) and produces A5 = KrF2. This provides a very logical and elegant solution to this part of the puzzle.\n    *   **A4:** KrF4.\n    *   **A5:** KrF2.\n    *   **Decomposition of A5 in water:** \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" The reaction of KrF2 with water gives Kr, O2, and HF (three substances). This is another factual inconsistency in the problem statement, but it doesn't prevent the identification of A4.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n    Based on our deduction, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF4).\n    *   Molar mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.8 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of A4 (KrF4) = M(Kr) + 4 * M(F) = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0 = 83.8 + 76 = 159.8 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 159.8 g/mol. We check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160 (159.8 is in this range)\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 110-130\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 falls into the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula for a binary fluoride is YFₓ.\n\nThe mass percentage of fluorine can be expressed as:\nɷF = (x * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + x * Ar(F))\n\nLet Ar(F) be approximately 19.00 g/mol and Ar(Y) be the atomic weight of element Y.\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (Ar(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for Ar(Y):\n0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * x = 19.00 * x\n0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 19.00 * x - 6.0724 * x\n0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 12.9276 * x\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nWe can test integer values for x (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible atomic weight for element Y.\n*   If x = 1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 (close to Ca, Ar, K - unlikely candidates)\n*   If x = 2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 (close to Br, Se - Bromine only forms 3 stable fluorides)\n*   If x = 3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 (close to Sb, but it only forms 2 fluorides)\n*   If x = 4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 (close to Dy, Tb)\n*   If x = 5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 (close to Hg, Tl)\n*   If x = 6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 (close to Am)\n*   If x = 7, Ar(Y) ≈ 283.15\n\nLet's use a more precise atomic mass for Fluorine (18.998 g/mol) and check against a table of elements for a better match. The element must also satisfy other conditions: forming five binary fluorides and having strongly oxidizing higher fluorides.\n\nA known element that fits these criteria remarkably well is Rhenium (Re).\nLet's test this hypothesis.\nIf Y = Rhenium (Re), its atomic weight Ar(Re) is 186.21 g/mol.\nLet's see which fluoride of Rhenium gives a fluorine mass percentage close to 31.96%.\n186.21 ≈ 40.45 * x  => x ≈ 186.21 / 40.45 ≈ 4.6. This is very close to x=5.\n\nLet's assume A2 is ReF₅.\n*   Formula: ReF₅\n*   Molar Mass: 186.21 + 5 * 18.998 = 186.21 + 94.99 = 281.2 g/mol\n*   Mass % of F: (94.99 / 281.2) * 100% = 33.78%\nThis value (33.78%) is not close enough to 31.96%.\n\nLet's re-examine the list. Let's assume A2 is ReF₆.\n*   Formula: ReF₆\n*   Molar Mass: 186.21 + 6 * 18.998 = 186.21 + 113.988 = 300.198 g/mol\n*   Mass % of F: (113.988 / 300.198) * 100% = 37.97%\nThis is also not a match.\n\nLet's try ReF₄.\n*   Formula: ReF₄\n*   Molar Mass: 186.21 + 4 * 18.998 = 186.21 + 75.992 = 262.202 g/mol\n*   Mass % of F: (75.992 / 262.202) * 100% = 28.98%\nThis is also not a match.\n\nThere might be an error in the problem's percentage, or we are on the wrong track. Let's reconsider another candidate from our list.\nIf x = 6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7. This is very close to Americium (Am, 243).\nLet's test if A2 = AmF₆.\n*   Mass % of F in AmF₆ = (6 * 19) / (243 + 6*19) = 114 / 357 = 31.93%.\nThis is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n\nLet's check if Americium fits the other clues:\n1.  **Five binary compounds with fluorine**: Americium is known to form AmF₂, AmF₃, AmF₄, and possibly AmF₅ and AmF₆, though the higher oxidation states are less stable. The existence of five compounds is plausible.\n2.  **A1 is bright-red, decomposes, and oxidizes Xenon**: The decomposition is A1 -> A2 + F₂. Since A2 = AmF₆, A1 must be a higher fluoride. Such a compound (e.g., AmF₇ or AmF₈) is unknown and highly unlikely. More probably, there's a typo in the question and A1 is the higher fluoride which decomposes to A2. Let's assume the decomposition is: A1 (e.g. AmF₄) -> A2 (e.g. AmF₃) + ½ F₂. But this contradicts A2 being AmF₆.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem's text. Perhaps the compound A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, but A2 is not the direct product, but one of the resulting species. The decomposition of a bright-red higher fluoride of a transition metal (like ReF₇) could be complex.\n\nLet's assume Y=Rhenium despite the mass percentage discrepancy, as its chemical properties are a strong fit. Rhenium forms ReF₄, ReF₅, ReF₆, and ReF₇. The existence of five fluorides is often cited.\n*   **A1**: The highest oxide, ReF₇, is yellow. This doesn't match \"bright-red\".\n*   **A3**: This is another fluoride that interacts with Xenon. ReF₆ reacts with Xe to form [XeF][ReF₆]. This fits.\n\nLet's try **Krypton (Kr)** as element Y.\n*   Ar(Kr) = 83.8 g/mol. From our formula, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 for x=2.\n*   If A2 = KrF₂, Mass % F = (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 38) = 38 / 121.8 = 31.2%. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\n*   **Five binary compounds**: This is false for Krypton. Only KrF₂ and KrF₄ (unstable) are known.\n*   **A1 oxidizes Xenon**: Krypton compounds like KrF₂ are exceptionally strong oxidizers and will oxidize xenon.\n*   **A1 bright-red**: KrF₂ is a white solid.\nThis hypothesis fails on multiple points.\n\nLet's assume the given percentage is correct and re-evaluate our calculation which led to Americium.\n*   Y = Am\n*   A2 = AmF₆\n*   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into AmF₆ and F₂. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride like AmF₈, which is highly speculative. However, Am(VI) is a very strong oxidant.\n\nLet's consider the last piece of information.\n*   Y + A4 -> A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n*   A4 is a colorless concentrated solution.\n*   A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n\nIf Y=Am, the reaction is: Am + A4 -> A5.\nA4 is a fluoride of Americium. Let's assume A4 is AmF₄ in a solvent. Adding Am metal would reduce it: Am + 3AmF₄ -> 4AmF₃. The ratio is not 1:1.\nThe statement \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" suggests A4 is dissolved in something. An aqueous solution is unlikely for reactive fluorides. A common solvent for fluorination chemistry is anhydrous HF (aHF).\n\nConsider A4 to be an acid. A common acid formed from these types of fluorides is a fluoroacid, like H₂[YFₙ₊₂].\nIf A4 = H₂[AmF₈], this acid is known (formed from AmF₆).\nAm + H₂[AmF₈] -> ??? This reaction is not straightforward.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"five compounds\" clue. This points strongly to Rhenium (Re) or a similar transition metal. Let's assume the mass % was a typo and should have been closer to that of ReF₄ (28.98%) or ReF₅ (33.78%). Or that the decomposition product is complex.\n\nLet's work backward from the final reaction, assuming Y=Re.\nRe + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nA4 is likely an oxyfluoride acid of Rhenium dissolved in water (\"concentrated solution\", which can be aqueous). A5 decomposes in water. This is consistent with many Re compounds.\nA common, stable, colorless Rhenium species in water is the perrhenate ion, [ReO₄]⁻, forming perrhenic acid HReO₄.\nLet's assume **A4 is perrhenic acid, HReO₄**. It is commercially available as a colorless aqueous solution.\n\nThe reaction is:\nRe + HReO₄ -> A5\nThis is a comproportionation reaction.\nRe(0) + Re(VII) -> A5\nThe oxidation state of Re in A5 would be intermediate. For a 1:1 reaction, the product would have an average oxidation state that might not be an integer or could be a mixture. However, in many comproportionation reactions, a stable intermediate state is formed, and the stoichiometry is balanced accordingly.\nA known stable oxide of Rhenium is ReO₂ (Rhenium(IV) dioxide). Let's see if the reaction can form this:\nRe + 2HReO₄ → 3ReO₂ + H₂O\nThis does not have a 1:1 molar ratio of Re to HReO₄.\n\nAnother possibility involves the solvent. \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" could imply a non-aqueous solvent, but if we consider it as aqueous HReO₄, it is a good candidate for A4.\n\nLet's assume A4 is HReO₄.\nMolecular Weight of HReO₄ = 1.008 (H) + 186.21 (Re) + 4 * 16.00 (O)\nMW = 1.008 + 186.21 + 64.00 = 251.218 g/mol.\nThis falls into the range 220-240 if we consider some rounding.\n\nLet's check if this is consistent.\n*   **Y = Re**. Forms many fluorides (ReF₄, ReF₅, ReF₆, ReF₇), fitting \"five compounds\".\n*   **A3 interacts with Xe**: ReF₆ reacts with Xe. A3=ReF₆.\n*   **A1 is bright-red, decomposes, strong oxidant**: This points to something like ReF₇ (yellow, not red) or an oxyfluoride. The properties of all five compounds are not fully specified, but Rhenium has highly oxidizing fluorides. Let's assume this clue points to a less common Re compound.\n*   **A2 has ɷF=31,96%**: This is the main conflicting point. No simple fluoride of Rhenium matches this. However, given the strong fit of all other clues for Y=Re and A4=HReO₄, it is plausible there is an error in this number in the problem statement.\n*   **A4 is HReO₄**: A stable compound, forms colorless aqueous solutions.\n*   **A5 formation**: Reaction between Re and HReO₄.\n*   **A5 decomposition in water**: If A5 is ReO₂, it is stable in water. However, the reaction could yield another species like Re₂O₅, which would hydrolyze. The reaction `Re + 2HReO4 → 3ReO2 + H2O` shows it's plausible.\n\nGiven the options, the molecular weight of HReO₄ (251.2 g/mol) is outside all ranges. Let me re-calculate.\nMW = 1.008 + 186.21 + 64.00 = 251.218. Let's re-read the options.\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 160-180\nD) 220-240\nMy result 251.2 is closest to D, but still outside.\n\nLet's reconsider A4. \"a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A4 itself is the solute. A4 could be a solid that is dissolved. If A4 is a binary fluoride, which one is soluble and colorless? None are particularly soluble in water without reaction.\n\nWhat if Y is not Rhenium? What if the Americium hypothesis (Y=Am, A2=AmF₆) is correct, and the reaction `Am + A4 -> A5` is the key?\nLet's assume A4 is an Americium compound. Perhaps a fluoroacid like H[AmF₅] or H₂[AmF₆]?\nMW(H[AmF₅]) = 1 + 243 + 5*19 = 339 g/mol.\nMW(H₂[AmF₆]) = 2 + 243 + 6*19 = 359 g/mol.\nThese are too high.\n\nLet's go back to the HReO₄ hypothesis. Is there a mistake in my calculation or assumptions?\nMW(HReO₄) = 251.2 g/mol.\nRange D is 220-240. The value is off by ~11.\nWhat if A4 is not an acid, but an oxide? The most common oxide is Re₂O₇.\nMW(Re₂O₇) = 2*186.21 + 7*16 = 372.42 + 112 = 484.42 g/mol. Too high. Re₂O₇ is a colorless solid. Its solution in water is HReO₄. So \"solution of A4\" could mean aqueous solution of Re₂O₇, which is HReO₄.\n\nThere must be a simpler explanation. Let's look at the candidates again.\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x.\nIf x=3, Ar(Y)=121.3. Close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\nLet's check Sb. Fluorides: SbF₃, SbF₅. Only two. Fails.\nIf x=4, Ar(Y)=161.8. Close to Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5). Unlikely lanthanide chemistry.\nIf Y=Iodine, Ar(I)=126.9. %F in IF₃ is 31.0%. It's close.\nIf Y=I, what is A4? An iodine compound forming a colorless solution. Periodic acid (HIO₄ or H₅IO₆).\nMW(HIO₄) = 1+127+64 = 192 g/mol. Not in ranges.\nMW(H₅IO₆) = 5+127+96 = 228 g/mol. This falls in range D (220-240).\nLet's check this. A4 = H₅IO₆.\nReaction: I + H₅IO₆ -> A5 (1:1). `I + H5IO6 -> ?` This reaction is not standard.\nAlso, IF₅ and IF₇ are colorless, not \"bright-red\". So Iodine is unlikely.\n\nThe Rhenium/HReO₄ hypothesis seems the most chemically sound, despite the conflict with the mass percentage and the final molecular weight being slightly out of range. Perhaps A4 is not HReO₄, but a different compound related to Rhenium.\nWhat if A4 is Rhenium heptafluoride, ReF₇? It's a low-melting solid (48°C), could be used in a \"hot... solution\".\nMW(ReF₇) = 186.21 + 7*19 = 319.2 g/mol. Too high.\n\nGiven the high consistency of the Rhenium hypothesis for most clues and the fact that H₅IO₆ has a MW in the correct range but fails on other clues, there might be an error in the problem data. However, if we must choose, the H₅IO₆ path gives a MW that perfectly fits an answer choice. Let's re-evaluate iodine.\nY = I. Five fluorides? Let's assume yes for the sake of the problem. A1 is bright-red? Maybe an impure sample or an unknown compound. Let's ignore this clue. A1 oxidizes Xe? IF₇ can react with Xe sources, but doesn't directly oxidize Xe metal easily.\nThis path seems weak.\n\nLet's trust the H₅IO₆ molecular weight. It's 228 g/mol. This falls squarely in the 220-240 range. Despite the chemical inconsistencies with Iodine, this numerical match is very strong. Often in such problems, one path leads to a perfect numerical fit.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for A2 can be written as YF_n.\n    The mass percentage formula is: ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n    Using the atomic weight of Fluorine (Ar(F) ≈ 19 g/mol):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (Ar(Y) + n * 19)\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for the atomic weight of Y (Ar(Y)):\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 19n - 6.0724n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 12.9276n\n    Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now, we test integer values for 'n' (the oxidation state of Y) to find a matching element:\n    *   n=1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 (No suitable element)\n    *   n=2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 (Close to Bromine, Ar(Br)=79.9)\n    *   n=3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 (Very close to Antimony, Ar(Sb)=121.76)\n    *   n=4: Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 (No suitable element)\n    *   n=5: Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 (No good match)\n    *   n=6: Ar(Y) ≈ 242.6 (Close to Plutonium, Ar(Pu)=244)\n\n    Let's check the candidates by calculating the theoretical mass percentage:\n    *   For BrF2: %F = (2 * 19) / (79.9 + 38) = 32.23%\n    *   For SbF3: %F = (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 57) = 31.89%\n    *   For PuF6: %F = (6 * 19) / (244 + 114) = 31.84%\n\n    Both Antimony (Sb) and Plutonium (Pu) give a mass percentage very close to the given 31.96%. However, the descriptions of the reactions will help us distinguish between them.\n\n2.  **Analyze the decomposition of A1.**\n    The problem states: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 ... and fluorine.\"\n    This means the reaction is: A1 → A2 + F₂.\n    This implies that A1 has a higher fluorine-to-Y ratio than A2.\n\n    *   **If Y=Pu**, the mass percentage calculation suggested A2=PuF6. If so, A1 would have to be PuF_x where x>6, which is not a known compound. Thus, the Plutonium hypothesis fails here.\n    *   **If Y=Sb**, the mass percentage calculation suggests A2=SbF3. Therefore, A1 must be a higher fluoride. The other common fluoride of antimony is SbF5. The reaction would be SbF5 → SbF3 + F₂. This is chemically plausible, although the problem's description of A1's properties (bright-red, decomposes at 293K) does not match SbF5 (colorless liquid, stable). We will proceed with Y=Sb as it's the most consistent choice based on the numerical data, acknowledging a likely inaccuracy in the descriptive text of A1.\n\n3.  **Identify the other substances.**\n    *   Y = Antimony (Sb)\n    *   A2 = Antimony trifluoride (SbF3)\n    *   A1 = Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) (based on the decomposition reaction)\n    *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\" (Sb + F₂ → SbF₃ or SbF₅).\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" SbF5 is a very strong Lewis acid and is known to form adducts with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF₂·SbF₅). SbF3 is much less reactive in this regard. Thus, A3 = SbF5.\n\n4.  **Analyze the final reaction to identify A4.**\n    \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    The reaction is: Y + A4 → A5, which is Sb + A4 → A5.\n    This describes the use of elemental antimony (oxidation state 0) to react with one of its fluorides (A4) to produce another fluoride (A5). This is a comproportionation reaction, where the elemental antimony must reduce the antimony in A4 to a lower oxidation state in A5.\n    This means A4 must be the higher-oxidation-state fluoride, SbF5, and A5 must be the lower-oxidation-state fluoride, SbF3.\n    The reaction is: Sb + SbF5 → SbF3\n    Let's check for consistency:\n    *   A4 is dissolved in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". SbF5 is a colorless liquid/solid that can be used in solutions. This fits.\n    *   A5 would be SbF3. This is consistent with A2 also being SbF3.\n    The balanced chemical reaction is `2 Sb + 3 SbF5 → 5 SbF3`. The 1:1 molar ratio given in the problem is incorrect, which is a common feature in complex chemistry problems to test understanding of the underlying principles over stoichiometric details.\n    Based on this analysis, A4 must be Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\n\n5.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n    We need to find the molecular weight of A4 = SbF5.\n    Atomic weight of Antimony (Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol.\n    Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    Molecular Weight (M) of SbF5 = Ar(Sb) + 5 * Ar(F)\n    M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n    Now we check the given ranges:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 110-130\n\n    The calculated molecular weight of 216.76 g/mol does not fall into any of these ranges. Let's re-examine our assignments. What if the reduction goes the other way? `A4 + SbF3 -> SbF5`? No, you cannot add elemental Sb to SbF3 to get SbF5.\n\n    Let's reconsider the reaction `2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3`.\n    I assumed A4=SbF5 and A5=SbF3.\n    What if A4 = SbF3 and A5=SbF5? The reaction would be `Sb + SbF3 -> SbF5`. This is an oxidation of both Sb species, which is not possible without an external oxidizing agent.\n\n    There seems to be an error in the problem statement or the options. Let's re-evaluate the initial mass calculation.\n    Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    Let's suppose n=4 is correct and Y is not a common element. Ar(Y) = 161.8. Let's call it 'X'.\n    A2 = XF4. M(XF4) = 161.8 + 4*19 = 237.8. %F = 76/237.8 = 31.96%. Perfect match.\n    So, Y is an element with Ar ≈ 161.8. Looking at the periodic table, Dysprosium (Dy) has Ar=162.5.\n    Let's test Y = Dy.\n    A2 = DyF4. M = 162.5 + 4*19 = 238.5. %F = 76/238.5 = 31.86%. Very good match.\n    Let's follow this hypothesis.\n    *   Y = Dysprosium (Dy).\n    *   Known fluorides are DyF2, DyF3. DyF4 is known but unstable.\n    *   A2 = DyF4.\n    *   A1 -> DyF4 + F2. This would mean A1 is DyF5, which is unknown. The lanthanides don't typically reach +5.\n\n    Let's go back to the most chemically sound deduction: Y=Sb, A2=SbF3, A4=SbF5. The MW is ~217 g/mol. This is very close to range B (220-240). It's possible the ranges are slightly off or based on approximations. However, there is a better explanation.\n\n    Let's re-read the final reaction clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    It is possible I have misidentified A4 and A5. Let's swap them.\n    Reaction: Sb + A5 → A4 (1:1 ratio)\n    Let's assume A5 is the reactant and A4 is the product. But the sentence says \"adding Y ... to a ... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\". This structure implies A4 is the reactant and A5 is the product.\n\n    Given the high confidence in Y=Sb and A2=SbF3, and the chemical logic that leads to A4=SbF5, there must be an error in the question's provided ranges. The calculated value for M(SbF5) is 216.76 g/mol. Let's re-examine the options. It is possible that A4 is actually SbF3. Let's test this possibility.\n\n    If A4 = SbF3, what would the reaction be? `Sb + SbF3 -> ?`. This doesn't seem right.\n    However, if we are forced to choose an answer from the options, let's look at the MW of the other compound, SbF3.\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    This value, 178.76 g/mol, falls perfectly into range A (160-180).\n\n    Now, we must find a chemical justification for A4 being SbF3. This requires re-interpreting the last clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    Could the reaction be an oxidation? Perhaps using a different reagent mentioned implicitly? Or maybe it's not a redox reaction.\n    Example: `SbCl3 + 3HF -> SbF3 + 3HCl`. This is a synthesis, but doesn't match the prompt `Y + A4 -> A5`.\n    What if the solution is not inert? For example, if A4 (SbF3) is dissolved in BrF3 (a fluorinating solvent) and Sb is added? The chemistry gets too speculative.\n\n    Let's assume there is a significant error in the last clue's description and that our identification of the compounds is correct: the two main compounds are SbF3 and SbF5. One of them is A4.\n    M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol (fits range A)\n    M(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol (does not fit any range)\n    Given that one of the options must be correct, the only possibility is that A4 is SbF3. This implies there is a severe error in the problem's description of the reaction used to make A5, but that the identity of A4 is SbF3. The problem is flawed, but a choice must be made based on the plausible chemical species derived.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Element Y = Sb is the best fit for the mass percentage.\n*   This means the compounds are fluorides of antimony.\n*   The primary candidates for A4 are SbF3 and SbF5.\n*   M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol, which is in the range 160-180.\n*   M(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol, which is not in any of the provided ranges.\n*   Therefore, despite the confusing final clue, A4 must be SbF3 for its molecular weight to match one of the options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y\nThe problem describes a series of reactions involving five binary fluorides of an element Y. A key piece of information is that substance A2, a fluoride of Y, has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ (assuming a single atom of Y, which is common for simple binary compounds).\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWhere M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\nRearranging for M(Y):\nM(Y) * 0.3196 = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\nM(Y) = n * (19.00 * 0.6804 / 0.3196)\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\nWe also know that some of these fluorides (A1, A3) are extremely strong oxidizing agents, capable of reacting with Xenon. This points to elements that can achieve very high oxidation states, such as the later actinides or some p-block/d-block elements. High oxidation states are common for fluorides. Let's test plausible integer values for n, the oxidation state of Y in A2.\n\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 (Ca, Sc). Not known for such reactive fluorides.\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 (Br, Se). Selenium is a possibility.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 (Sb). Antimony forms SbF₃, SbF₅.\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 (Dy, Tb). Lanthanides, can reach +4 state.\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 (Au, Hg, Bi). Bismuth forms BiF₅.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7. This is very close to the molar masses of late actinides like Americium (Am, 243 g/mol) and Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n\nActinides like Pu and Am are well-known for forming multiple, highly reactive fluorides, including hexafluorides (YF₆). This is a very strong match.\nLet's verify with Y = Americium (Am, M=243 g/mol) and A2 = AmF₆ (n=6).\nɷF(AmF₆) = (6 * 19) / (243 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 357 ≈ 0.3193 = 31.93%.\nThis is extremely close to the given 31.96%. Thus, it's highly probable that **Y is Americium (Am)** and **A2 is Americium Hexafluoride (AmF₆)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify A1, A3, and A5\n*   **A1**: Decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (AmF₆) and fluorine. This means A1 is a higher, unstable fluoride, like a hypothetical AmF₇ or AmF₈. Its properties (bright-red, unstable, oxidizes xenon) are consistent with a \"super-fluoride\".\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Y (Am) and it also reacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of americium can produce its highest stable fluoride, AmF₆. AmF₆ is an extremely strong oxidizing agent and would react with xenon. So, **A3 is also AmF₆**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The core reaction is: Y + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio). The reaction takes place in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". Since Y (Am) is an element (a metal), it will act as a reducing agent. A4 must be an oxidizing agent. The fact that the solution of A4 is colorless and the context of Xenon reactivity strongly suggest that A4 could be a fluoride of a noble gas, like krypton or xenon, which are colorless solids that can form colorless solutions in anhydrous HF.\n\n### Step 3: Identify A4 by analyzing the reaction\nThe reaction is **Am + A4 → A5** with a **1:1 molar ratio**. This implies a direct relationship between the number of electrons lost by one atom of Americium and the number of electrons gained by one molecule of A4.\nAm → Amⁿ⁺ + n e⁻\nA4 + n e⁻ → Products\n\nLet's test potential candidates for A4 that fit the description and the MW ranges.\n\n*   **Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**: MW = 121.8 g/mol (Range B).\n    *   Reaction: Kr(II) + 2e⁻ → Kr(0). This requires n=2.\n    *   So, Am + KrF₂ → AmF₂ + Kr. The product is Am(II). This is a possible oxidation state.\n    *   However, KrF₂ is unstable and decomposes upon heating. The reaction in a \"hot\" solution makes this choice unlikely.\n\n*   **Xenon difluoride (XeF₂)**: MW = 169.3 g/mol (**Range A**).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(II) + 2e⁻ → Xe(0). This requires n=2.\n    *   So, Am + XeF₂ → AmF₂ + Xe. The product is Am(II). This is chemically plausible, although Am(III) is more stable. The product A5 would be AmF₂, which is known to decompose in water. This is a strong candidate.\n\n*   **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**: MW = 207.3 g/mol (Not in any range).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(IV) + 4e⁻ → Xe(0). This requires n=4.\n    *   So, Am + XeF₄ → AmF₄ + Xe. The product is Am(IV), a known oxidation state. Chemically, this is very sound. However, its molecular weight does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n\n*   **Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆)**: MW = 245.3 g/mol (Very close to, but outside of Range D: 220-240).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(VI) + 6e⁻ → Xe(0). This requires n=6.\n    *   So, Am + XeF₆ → AmF₆ + Xe. The product is Am(VI), which matches A2 and A3. This is chemically plausible. The only issue is the molecular weight being slightly outside the given range.\n\n*   **Iodine pentafluoride (IF₅)**: MW = 221.9 g/mol (**Range D**).\n    *   Reaction: I(V) + 2e⁻ → I(III) (as IF₃). This requires n=2.\n    *   So, Am + IF₅ → AmF₂ + IF₃. The product is Am(II). This is plausible. A5 would be a mixture of AmF₂ and IF₃, both of which decompose in water.\n    *   However, the problem has strong thematic links to Xenon chemistry, making an iodine compound a less likely answer.\n\n### Step 4: Final Evaluation and Conclusion\nWe are left with two primary candidates that fit a range and have plausible (if not perfect) chemistry:\n1.  **A4 = XeF₂** (MW 169.3 g/mol, in Range A). Thematic link is strong.\n2.  **A4 = IF₅** (MW 221.9 g/mol, in Range D). No thematic link.\n\nThe problem's repeated mention of xenon (A1 oxidizes Xe, A3 interacts with Xe) is a significant hint that the chemistry is centered around species of this type. This makes XeF₂ a far more probable candidate for A4 than IF₅ or any other non-xenon compound. The reaction Am + XeF₂ → AmF₂ + Xe is stoichiometrically balanced in a 1:1 ratio. While Am(III) is generally more stable, the formation of Am(II) under specific conditions is not impossible, and for the sake of the puzzle's constraints, it is a valid pathway.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that A4 is XeF₂.\nThe molecular weight of XeF₂ is M(Xe) + 2 * M(F) ≈ 131.3 + 2 * 19.0 = 169.3 g/mol.\nThis value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that compound A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, and `n` is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    We can plug in the given values and rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y) in terms of `n`:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00 * n) = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * n = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now, we test plausible integer values for `n` (the valency or number of fluorine atoms) to find a corresponding element Y.\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ca, but Ca does not fit the described chemistry of forming five fluorides).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br, or Krypton, Kr, but this is less likely given the other clues).\n    *   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol. Antimony is known to form multiple fluorides and fits the description of an element \"Y\".\n    *   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No common element fits this well).\n\n    The best fit is Y = Antimony (Sb) and n = 3. This means **A2 is SbF3**. Let's verify the fluorine mass percentage in SbF3 using more precise molar masses (M(Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol, M(F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol).\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 18.998) / (121.76 + 3 * 18.998) = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that Y is Sb and A2 is SbF3.\n\n2.  **Identify Other Compounds.**\n    *   The five binary compounds are fluorides of antimony. The two most stable and common are SbF3 (antimony trifluoride) and SbF5 (antimony pentafluoride).\n    *   A1 and A3 are described as oxidizing agents for xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is a very powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent capable of reacting with xenon. Therefore, it is highly likely that **A3 = SbF5**.\n    *   We are looking for the molecular weight range of A4. The most logical candidates for A4 are the two stable fluorides: SbF3 or SbF5. The other \"compounds\" mentioned are likely complexes or less stable species (A1, A5).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of Potential Candidates for A4.**\n    Let's calculate the molecular weight for both SbF3 and SbF5 and see which one fits the given options.\n    *   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF3**\n        Molecular Weight (MW) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\n        MW(SbF3) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF5**\n        Molecular Weight (MW) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\n        MW(SbF5) = 121.76 g/mol + 5 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 95.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n4.  **Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Ranges.**\n    Now, we check which of these calculated molecular weights falls into the answer choices:\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 110-130\n\n    *   The MW of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit into any range. It is close to range A, but outside of it.\n    *   The MW of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range **B) 160-180**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the strong quantitative evidence, compound A4 must be SbF3. The description of the reaction involving A4 (`Sb + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 ratio) is confusing and chemically unusual for SbF3, but in puzzle-like problems, the quantitative data is often the most reliable clue. The calculation of the molecular weight provides a clear and unambiguous answer.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is approximately 179 g/mol, which lies in the range 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nMy apologies, the previous code failed because the `periodictable` library is not available. I can perform the calculation manually without needing a special library.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The most critical clue is the composition of substance A2. A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's denote the formula of A2 as YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, Ar(Y) is the atomic weight of Y, and Ar(F) is the atomic weight of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for Ar(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (Ar(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * (Ar(Y) + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 12.9276n\n    Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\n    Now we test integer values for `n` to find a plausible element from the periodic table:\n    *   If n=1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca, 40.08 g/mol), but a Group 2 metal fluoride does not fit the described chemistry (oxidizing xenon, etc.).\n    *   If n=2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol), but its chemistry is also not a perfect match for the higher oxidation states required.\n    *   If n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol). Antimony is a p-block element known to form multiple fluorides and exhibit the kind of reactivity described. Let's verify this.\n    *   If Y = Sb and n = 3, then A2 = SbF3. The mass percentage of F in SbF3 is:\n        ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Compounds:**\n    *   **Y = Sb (Antimony)**\n    *   **A2 = SbF3 (Antimony trifluoride)**\n    *   The problem mentions five binary fluorides. The most common are SbF3 and SbF5.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Sb) and it reacts with xenon. This points to the highest fluoride, which is a powerful Lewis acid. **A3 = SbF5 (Antimony pentafluoride)**. SbF5 is known to react with XeF2 to form salts like [XeF][SbF6].\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and F2 at room temperature. This suggests a less stable, higher fluoride than SbF3. This might be a more exotic fluoride or a slight inaccuracy in the problem description, but it doesn't hinder solving for A4.\n\n3.  **Determine A4:** The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. A4 is one of the binary compounds of Sb and F. The most likely candidates are the stable ones: SbF3 and SbF5.\n\n    Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF3:**\n        MW(SbF3) = Ar(Sb) + 3 * Ar(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 57 = **178.76 g/mol**\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF5:**\n        MW(SbF5) = Ar(Sb) + 5 * Ar(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95 = **216.76 g/mol**\n\n4.  **Match with the Given Ranges:**\n    *   A) 140-160\n    *   B) 110-130\n    *   C) 160-180\n    *   D) 220-240\n\n    The calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly into the range **160-180**.\n    The calculated molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the ranges.\n\n    Therefore, the substance A4 must be SbF3.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nI will solve this step-by-step, analyzing each piece of information provided in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the formula YFm. The mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) is given as 31.96%. We can use this to find a relationship between the atomic mass of Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (m).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))\n\nUsing the atomic mass of fluorine, M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol, and the given percentage:\n0.3196 = (m * 19.00) / (M(Y) + m * 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) + 19.00m = (m * 19.00) / 0.3196\nM(Y) + 19.00m ≈ 59.45m\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45m\n\nNow, we can test integer values for 'm' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find plausible atomic masses for element Y.\n*   If m = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium)\n*   If m = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine)\n*   If m = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, M=121.76 g/mol)\n*   If m = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, Dy, M=162.50 g/mol)\n*   If m = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Gold or Mercury)\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical fluorine percentage for the most likely candidates:\n*   For Y = Sb (Antimony) and m = 3 (compound SbF3):\n    ωF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96% (a relative difference of only 0.25%).\n*   For Y = Dy (Dysprosium) and m = 4 (compound DyF4):\n    ωF(DyF4) = (4 * 19.00) / (162.50 + 4 * 19.00) = 76 / 238.50 ≈ 0.31865 or 31.87%. This is also extremely close.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the chemical properties to identify Y.**\n\nLet's compare the chemical properties of Antimony and Dysprosium with the problem description.\n*   **A1 oxidizes xenon:** This implies A1 is a very strong oxidizing agent, typically a high-valent fluoride. Antimony forms SbF5, which is a very strong Lewis acid and can participate in reactions that oxidize xenon (e.g., forming salts like [XeF][Sb2F11]). A hypothetical higher fluoride of antimony (A1) would be an even stronger oxidizer. Dysprosium is an electropositive lanthanide metal and is not known to form compounds that can oxidize xenon. This strongly favors **Y = Sb**.\n*   **Other clues:** While other clues like \"five binary compounds\" and \"bright-red substance A1\" do not perfectly match the known chemistry of antimony (only SbF3 and SbF5 are common, and both are colorless/white), these are more likely to be idealized or erroneous statements in a complex problem than the core chemical reactivity and mass percentage data. For instance, A1 could be a hypothetical unstable, colored higher fluoride that decomposes to A2.\n\nBased on the combination of the mass percentage calculation and chemical properties, we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** (Antimony) and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the other substances, particularly A4.**\n\nWith Y = Sb, we can deduce the identities of the other compounds.\n*   **A2 = SbF3**.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y and interacts with xenon:** The exhaustive fluorination of antimony yields antimony pentafluoride, SbF5. SbF5 is a known interactor with xenon. So, **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine:** This means A1 must be a higher fluoride than SbF3. The most logical candidate is SbF5, though the decomposition conditions given are unusual.\n*   **A4 is used in a reaction with element Y:** The reaction is described as \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\". This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state (Y) reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state (A4) to form a product in an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n\nThe most well-known comproportionation reaction for antimony is:\n2 Sb(0) + 3 SbF5(+5) → 5 SbF3(+3)\n\nFor this type of reaction to occur, A4 must be the compound with Y in the higher oxidation state. Therefore, **A4 must be SbF5**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\nNow we calculate the molecular weight of A4, which we have identified as SbF5.\n*   Atomic mass of Antimony (Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Fluorine (F) = 19.00 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight (MW) of SbF5 = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\nMW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00\nMW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 95.00\n**MW(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol**\n\nNow we check which of the given ranges this molecular weight falls into.\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 216.76 g/mol does not fall neatly into any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to the lower boundary of range D (220-240). In the context of multiple-choice questions with potential for slight rounding or non-ideal ranges, 216.76 g/mol is unambiguously associated with range D. No other plausible identification of A4 leads to a molecular weight close to any of the other ranges. For instance, if A4 were SbF3, its MW would be 178.76 g/mol (Range B), but this contradicts the chemical logic of the comproportionation reaction. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that A4 is SbF5, and its molecular weight belongs in the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the data for substance A2.**\n    A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the formula YFm. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given as 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    `ɷF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))`\n    Where M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\n    Let's rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    `0.3196 = (m * 19.00) / (M(Y) + m * 19.00)`\n    `0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00m) = 19.00m`\n    `0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724m = 19.00m`\n    `0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276m`\n    `M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * m`\n    `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m`\n\n    Now, we need to find an element Y and an integer `m` (a plausible oxidation state) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for `m`:\n    *   m = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to K, Ca, Sc). None of these fit the later chemical descriptions (e.g., forming 5 fluorides, oxidizing xenon).\n    *   m = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br, Se, Kr). These were considered and ruled out based on other properties described in the problem.\n    *   m = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This molar mass is very close to that of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   m = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (similar to Tb, Dy). These are lanthanides, less likely to fit the overall description.\n    *   m = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi). Bismuth was checked and ruled out.\n\n2.  **Confirm Y is Antimony (Sb).**\n    Let's assume Y is Sb and `m=3`. This means A2 is antimony trifluoride (SbF3). Let's calculate the theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF3 to verify our assumption.\n    *   M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n    *   M(F) = 18.998 g/mol (using a more precise value)\n    *   M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n    *   ɷF = (3 * 18.998 / 178.754) * 100% = 31.88%\n    This calculated value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem statement. Thus, we can confidently identify **Y as Sb** and **A2 as SbF3**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4.**\n    The problem states that A4 is another binary compound of fluorine with element Y (Sb). The most common and stable binary fluorides of antimony are antimony trifluoride (SbF3) and antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). Therefore, A4 is likely one of these two compounds.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weights of the possible compounds for A4.**\n    *   **If A4 = SbF3**: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   **If A4 = SbF5**: M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Compare the calculated molecular weights with the given ranges.**\n    The question asks to identify the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls.\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 140-160\n\n    Comparing our calculated values:\n    *   M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol, which falls squarely within range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   M(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol, which does not fall into any of the given ranges. It is close to range A, but outside of it.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The molecular weight of SbF3 is a perfect match for one of the answer choices. This provides strong evidence that **A4 is SbF3**. The other chemical details in the problem (the color of A1, the stoichiometry of the reaction to form A5) appear to be either contradictory, erroneous, or require knowledge of very obscure chemistry. However, they are not needed to solve the central question, which relies on the numerical data provided for A2 and the molar mass ranges given in the options. Based on the molar mass calculation, A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic weight of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The mass fraction is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the atomic weight of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (12.9276) / 0.3196\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.5 g/mol (Calcium, but doesn't fit other criteria).\n    *   n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, but only has 3 main fluorides).\n    *   n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (Antimony, but only has 2 main fluorides).\n    *   n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Dysprosium/Terbium, do not have 5 fluorides or fit the reactivity).\n    *   n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol (Mercury/Thallium/Lead, do not fit the criteria).\n    *   n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Plutonium/Americium, actinides). Pu fits the reactivity but leads to contradictions.\n\n    Let's check non-metal halogens. Iodine (I) has an atomic weight of 126.9 g/mol.\n    If Y = I, then 126.9 ≈ 40.45 * n, which gives n ≈ 3.13. This suggests that n=3 is a very strong possibility.\n    Let's check if A2 = IF3.\n    The theoretical mass fraction of fluorine in IF3 is:\n    M(IF3) = 126.9 + 3 * 19.0 = 183.9 g/mol\n    ɷF(IF3) = (3 * 19.0) / 183.9 = 57.0 / 183.9 ≈ 0.3100 or 31.00%.\n    This value is very close to the given 31.96%. Chemistry problems from competitions can sometimes have slight inaccuracies in the provided data. This is the most plausible identification. So, we'll proceed with Y = Iodine (I) and A2 = IF3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of the Other Compounds.**\n    *   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Iodine) are known.\"** The main iodine fluorides are IF, IF3, IF5, and IF7. To reach five, one might count unstable species or dimers like I2F6. We'll assume this condition is met.\n    *   **\"A1 is a bright-red substance...\"**: This clue is problematic, as the common higher iodine fluorides (IF5, IF7) are colorless. This may be a red herring or an error in the problem statement. We can solve for A4 without a definitive identification of A1.\n    *   **\"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\"**: This is a key clue for identifying A4. A4 is one of the iodine fluorides. Let's look at their properties:\n        *   IF: Unstable solid, decomposes. Cannot form a hot concentrated solution.\n        *   IF3: Yellow solid, decomposes above -28°C. Cannot form a hot concentrated solution.\n        *   IF5: A stable, colorless liquid (m.p. 9.4 °C, b.p. 104.5 °C). It can exist as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" (it can be the solution itself). This is a perfect match.\n        *   IF7: A colorless gas at room temperature. Cannot form a hot concentrated solution.\n    Based on physical properties, **A4 must be IF5**.\n\n3.  **Confirm the Identification of A4 with the Reaction Clues.**\n    *   **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"**\n        *   Element Y is Iodine, which exists as I2. So, we add I2 to A4 (which we identified as IF5).\n        *   The reaction is: `I2 + IF5 -> A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio.\n        *   This could be the formation of a stable adduct, A5 = I2·IF5. This satisfies the 1:1 stoichiometry.\n    *   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"**\n        *   A5 (I2·IF5) would react with water. Iodine fluorides hydrolyze to form hydrofluoric acid (HF) and an iodine oxyacid (like HIO3). The iodine (I2) may remain. For example: `I2 + IF5 + 3H2O -> I2 + 5HF + HIO3`. In any case, it decomposes into multiple substances, fitting the clue.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Our identification leads to A4 being iodine pentafluoride (IF5).\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(A4) = M(IF5) = M(I) + 5 * M(F)\n    M(IF5) = 126.9 g/mol + 5 * 19.0 g/mol = 126.9 + 95.0 = 221.9 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 221.9 g/mol. We now check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 221.9 g/mol falls within the range 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the chemical formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms (which also represents the oxidation state of Y in this compound).\n\n    *   The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   The mass fraction formula is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    *   Substituting the given values: 0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n        *   0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\n        *   M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\n        *   M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can now test integer values for `n` to find a corresponding element Y with a matching molar mass. We will execute a short python script to check this relationship against the known elements.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_element(tolerance=1.0):\n        elements = {\n            \"H\": 1.008, \"He\": 4.0026, \"Li\": 6.94, \"Be\": 9.0122, \"B\": 10.81, \"C\": 12.011, \"N\": 14.007, \"O\": 15.999, \"F\": 18.998, \"Ne\": 20.180,\n            \"Na\": 22.990, \"Mg\": 24.305, \"Al\": 26.982, \"Si\": 28.085, \"P\": 30.974, \"S\": 32.06, \"Cl\": 35.45, \"Ar\": 39.948, \"K\": 39.098, \"Ca\": 40.078,\n            \"Sc\": 44.956, \"Ti\": 47.867, \"V\": 50.942, \"Cr\": 51.996, \"Mn\": 54.938, \"Fe\": 55.845, \"Co\": 58.933, \"Ni\": 58.693, \"Cu\": 63.546, \"Zn\": 65.38,\n            \"Ga\": 69.723, \"Ge\": 72.63, \"As\": 74.922, \"Se\": 78.971, \"Br\": 79.904, \"Kr\": 83.798, \"Rb\": 85.468, \"Sr\": 87.62, \"Y\": 88.906, \"Zr\": 91.224,\n            \"Nb\": 92.906, \"Mo\": 95.96, \"Tc\": 98, \"Ru\": 101.07, \"Rh\": 102.91, \"Pd\": 106.42, \"Ag\": 107.87, \"Cd\": 112.41, \"In\": 114.82, \"Sn\": 118.71,\n            \"Sb\": 121.76, \"Te\": 127.60, \"I\": 126.90, \"Xe\": 131.29, \"Cs\": 132.91, \"Ba\": 137.33, \"La\": 138.91, \"Ce\": 140.12, \"Pr\": 140.91, \"Nd\": 144.24,\n            \"Pm\": 145, \"Sm\": 150.36, \"Eu\": 151.96, \"Gd\": 157.25, \"Tb\": 158.93, \"Dy\": 162.50, \"Ho\": 164.93, \"Er\": 167.26, \"Tm\": 168.93, \"Yb\": 173.05,\n            \"Lu\": 174.97, \"Hf\": 178.49, \"Ta\": 180.95, \"W\": 183.84, \"Re\": 186.21, \"Os\": 190.23, \"Ir\": 192.22, \"Pt\": 195.08, \"Au\": 196.97, \"Hg\": 200.59,\n            \"Tl\": 204.38, \"Pb\": 207.2, \"Bi\": 208.98, \"Po\": 209, \"At\": 210, \"Rn\": 222, \"Fr\": 223, \"Ra\": 226, \"Ac\": 227, \"Th\": 232.04, \"Pa\": 231.04,\n            \"U\": 238.03, \"Np\": 237, \"Pu\": 244, \"Am\": 243, \"Cm\": 247, \"Bk\": 247, \"Cf\": 251, \"Es\": 252, \"Fm\": 257, \"Md\": 258, \"No\": 259, \"Lr\": 266\n        }\n        results = []\n        for n_val in range(1, 8):\n            M_Y = 40.45 * n_val\n            for symbol, mass in elements.items():\n                if abs(mass - M_Y) < tolerance:\n                    results.append((n_val, symbol, mass, M_Y))\n        print(\"Possible elements (n, Symbol, Actual Mass, Calculated Mass):\")\n        for r in results:\n            print(f\"n={r[0]}: {r[1]} (M={r[2]:.2f}).

While it wasn't on this specific list due to slight mass difference and tolerance, let's test it:\n    *   If Y = Kr (Krypton, M = 83.80 g/mol), for n=2, our formula gives M(Y) = 40.45 * 2 = 80.90 g/mol. This is reasonably close to Kr.\n    *   So, A2 = KrF₂. Let's verify the fluorine mass percentage in KrF₂:\n        M(KrF₂) = 83.80 + 2 * 19.00 = 121.80 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (2 * 19.00) / 121.80 = 38 / 121.80 = 0.3120 or 31.20%. This value is very close to the given 31.96%. The discrepancy is likely due to rounding of atomic masses or experimental data precision. Thus, Y is Krypton (Kr).\n\n2.  **Identify the Five Compounds A1-A5.**\n    Now that Y = Kr, let's use the other clues.\n    *   **A1** is a bright-red substance that decomposes to A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine at 293 K. The only known krypton fluoride higher than KrF₂ is KrF₄. It is also extremely unstable and would decompose as `KrF₄ -> KrF₂ + F₂`. While KrF₄'s color is debated (sometimes reported as red or colorless), its properties fit the description perfectly. Thus, **A1 = KrF₄**.\n    *   **A2** is **KrF₂**, as determined above.\n    *   **A1 (KrF₄) oxidizes xenon**. This is chemically correct; KrF₄ is a stronger oxidizing/fluorinating agent than Xe and would react with it.\n    *   **A3 can also interact with xenon**. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Kr with F₂. This sounds like KrF₂ or KrF₄. Since KrF₂ also reacts with Xe to form XeF₂ and Kr, A3 is likely KrF₂. But we have already identified A2 as KrF₂. For there to be five *different* compounds, A3 must be distinct. It is possible A3 refers to the same compound (KrF₂) used in a different context, but it's more likely a fifth compound. However, the known binary krypton fluorides are primarily KrF₂ and the highly unstable KrF₄. Other compounds like KrF are radical species. It is most plausible from the description that the primary compounds in the narrative are **KrF₄** and **KrF₂**.\n    *   Let's focus on A4 and A5, as A4 is the target of the question.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and A5.**\n    \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n    This describes the synthesis of a krypton-containing compound. Krypton clathrates are known compounds where Kr is trapped in a crystal lattice of another substance. One of the most common is the hydroquinone clathrate.\n    *   **A4**: Hydroquinone, C₆H₄(OH)₂. It forms colorless solutions.\n    *   Reaction: 3 C₆H₄(OH)₂ (A4) + Kr (Y) → [C₆H₄(OH)₂]₃·Kr (A5)\n        This is a typical formation of a clathrate, though the ratio is 3:1 hydroquinone to krypton. The \"1:1 molar ratio\" in the problem statement might refer to the ratio of reactants *added* rather than the stoichiometric ratio in the final product, which is common lab practice.\n    *   **A5**: Krypton-hydroquinone clathrate, [C₆H₄(OH)₂]₃·Kr.\n    *   **Decomposition in water**: When the clathrate A5 is dissolved in water, the weak van der Waals forces holding the cage together break, releasing the trapped krypton gas and dissolving the hydroquinone. So, the two substances formed are Krypton (Kr) and an aqueous solution of Hydroquinone (C₆H₄(OH)₂). This matches the description.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on our identification, A4 is hydroquinone.\n    *   Formula: C₆H₄(OH)₂\n    *   M(C) ≈ 12.01 g/mol\n    *   M(H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n    *   M(O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight (MW) = (6 * 12.01) + (6 * 1.01) + (2 * 16.00) = 72.06 + 6.06 + 32.00 = 110.12 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the Result with the Given Ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 110.12 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the range given in option D.\n    *   A) 140-160\n    *   B) 160-180\n    *   C) 220-240\n    *   D) 110-130\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 is in the range of 110-130 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe user's question is a multi-step chemistry puzzle. Let's break down the information to identify the unknown substances, particularly A4.\n\n**1. Analyzing the clues**\n\n*   **Element Y:** Forms at least five binary fluorides. This suggests Y could be a halogen (like I, Br), a chalcogen (Se, Te), a pnictogen (P, As, Sb), or a transition metal (like Ru, Rh, Pt, U).\n*   **A2 Composition:** The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The mass percentage is given by:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.0) / (M(Y) + n * 19.0)\n    Solving for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n * (1 - 0.3196) = 19n * 0.6804\n    M(Y) ≈ n * (12.9276 / 0.3196) ≈ n * 40.45 g/mol\n*   **A1 Properties:** It's a bright-red substance, decomposes at room temperature (293 K) into A2 and fluorine gas (A1 → A2 + F₂), and is a powerful enough oxidant to react with Xenon. The decomposition to A2 and F₂ implies that the oxidation state of Y in A1 is higher than in A2.\n*   **A3 Properties:** Can be formed by direct fluorination of Y and also reacts with Xenon. This suggests A3 is a high-oxidation-state fluoride.\n*   **A4 and A5 Formation:** A5 is formed by reacting Y and A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. `Y + A4 → A5`. This is a classic comproportionation reaction, where an element in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with a compound of the same element in a high oxidation state (A4) to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n*   **A4 Properties:** It forms a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". The \"colorless\" property is a very strong hint, often ruling out transition metal compounds which are typically colored. This points towards main-group elements.\n\n**2. Identifying Element Y and the Compounds**\n\nLet's test some candidate elements for Y using the M(Y) ≈ n * 40.45 relationship derived from the composition of A2.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Y = Antimony (Sb)**, M(Sb) ≈ 121.8 g/mol.\n    If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 3 * 40.45 = 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony's mass. So, A2 could be **SbF₃**. Let's verify the mass percent for SbF₃: (3*19)/(121.8+3*19) ≈ 31.88%. This is a good match.\n    *   Let's check other clues. If Y=Sb, A4 would be a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅. SbF₅ is a strong oxidant (reacts with Xe) and is colorless. This fits well. The reaction to form A5 would be `Sb + SbF₅ → A5`. However, the well-known comproportionation reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. This is not a 1:1 molar ratio, contradicting a key clue.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of A4=SbF₅. MW ≈ 121.8 + 5*19 = 216.8 g/mol. This value is not in any of the provided ranges (A, B, C, D). So, Sb is unlikely.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Y = Iodine (I)**, M(I) ≈ 126.9 g/mol.\n    If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is reasonably close. Let's assume A2 is **IF₃**. The theoretical ɷF for IF₃ is (3*19)/(126.9+3*19) ≈ 30.99%. This is somewhat off from 31.96%, but given the other constraints, let's proceed.\n    *   Let's check the crucial A4/A5 reaction. The problem states a 1:1 molar ratio: `Y + A4 → A5`. Let's assume this means one atom of Iodine reacts with one molecule of an iodine fluoride. A chemically plausible comproportionation is:\n        I + IF₅ → 2IF₃ (Oxidation states: 0, +5 → +3)\n    *   This implies: **A4 = IF₅** and **A5 = IF₃**.\n    *   Let's check the clues for A4=IF₅. Is it colorless? Yes, IF₅ is a colorless liquid. Can it form a hot concentrated solution? Yes. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the molecular weight of **A4 = IF₅**.\n        MW(IF₅) = M(I) + 5 * M(F) = 126.9 + 5 * 19.0 = 126.9 + 95 = **221.9 g/mol**.\n    *   Let's look at the answer options:\n        A) 140-160\n        B) 160-180\n        C) 220-240\n        D) 110-130\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of 221.9 g/mol falls squarely in the range **220-240**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite some ambiguities in the description of compound A1 (no common iodine fluoride is bright red), the evidence pointing to Y=Iodine and A4=IF₅ is very strong and is the only hypothesis that leads to a molecular weight consistent with the given options. The colorless nature of the A4 solution and the resulting molecular weight are the decisive factors.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the properties of compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that compound A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 is a higher fluoride of element Y than A2. The mass percentage (ɷF) of fluorine in A2 is given as 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\nThe molar mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is calculated as:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWe are given ɷF = 0.3196. Let's set up the equation to find the molar mass of Y (M(Y)).\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19n) = 19n\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n - 6.0724n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow, we test integer values for n (the number of fluorine atoms, representing the oxidation state) to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y.\n\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but Ca chemistry doesn't fit the problem's description).\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine, but BrF₂ is not the formula for a stable binary compound that would be a decomposition product).\n*   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Antimony, Sb=121.76, but SbF₃ is white and antimony fluorides are not known to oxidize xenon).\n*   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (no element fits well).\n*   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (very close to **Gold (Au)**, with an atomic mass of 196.97 g/mol).\n*   If n = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.70 g/mol (close to Americium/Plutonium, but as we'll see, Gold is a much better fit for all clues).\n\nLet's assume Y is Gold (Au). Then n=5, and A2 is **AuF₅**.\nLet's verify the mass percentage for AuF₅:\nM(AuF₅) = 196.97 + 5 * 19.00 = 196.97 + 95 = 291.97 g/mol.\nɷF = (95 / 291.97) * 100% ≈ 32.54%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, with the small discrepancy likely due to rounding in the problem data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the five binary compounds of Gold and Fluorine.**\n\nNow we verify the other clues based on Y being Gold.\n*   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n    Gold indeed has five known binary fluorides: AuF, Au₃F₅, AuF₃, AuF₅, and the dimeric form of gold(V) fluoride, Au₂F₁₀. These are our compounds A1-A5 in some order.\n*   **A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K and oxidizes xenon.**\n    The dimer **Au₂F₁₀** (also written as (AuF₅)₂) fits this description. It is a powerful oxidizing and fluorinating agent, stronger than AuF₅, and is known to be able to oxidize xenon. It is described as dark red. A1 -> A2 + F2 implies A1 has a higher fluorine content or reactivity than A2. Au₂F₁₀ is a good candidate for A1, and AuF₅ for A2. The low decomposition temperature fits the profile of a highly reactive substance. (Though A1 could also be AuF₅ and A2 be AuF₃). However, identifying A1 precisely is not needed to find A4.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Gold).**\n    Fluorination of gold powder with fluorine gas typically produces **AuF₃** or **AuF₅** depending on conditions (temperature and pressure).\n*   **\"A5 can be obtained by adding Y (Au) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.\"**\n    This describes a comproportionation reaction. We are mixing Au (oxidation state 0) with a gold fluoride A4 (oxidation state +n) to get A5 (oxidation state +m, where 0 < m < n). The 1:1 molar ratio is a key clue for the reaction:\n    Au⁰ + AuⁿFₙ → 2 Au^(n/2)F(n/2) (balanced for Gold).\n    Let's check the possible oxidation states of gold fluorides: +1, +5/3 (+1.67), +3, +5.\n    If A4 is **AuF₃** (Gold(III) fluoride), the reaction would be:\n    Au + AuF₃ → ... The product's oxidation state should be between 0 and +3. **AuF** (Gold(I) fluoride) has a gold oxidation state of +1. The balanced reaction is:\n    2Au + AuF₃ → 3AuF\n    This does not match the 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n    Let's try another possibility for A4. What if A4 is a solution of a complex acid? Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is the solvent in which these reactions are often carried out. Gold fluorides react with HF. Specifically, AuF₃ reacts with HF to form fluoroauric acid, **HAuF₄**.\n    *   HAuF₄ is a strong acid and exists in HF solutions. The solution is colorless, which matches the description \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n    *   Let's test the reaction of Au with HAuF₄ in a 1:1 molar ratio:\n        Au + HAuF₄ → ...\n        Here we mix Au(0) with Au(III). Comproportionation could lead to Au(I). Let's try to form a stable Au(I) complex, which could be our substance A5. A plausible reaction in HF is:\n        Au(s) + HAuF₄(solv) + 2HF(solv) → 2HAuF₂(solv)\n        In this reaction, we mix 1 mole of Au with 1 mole of the Au(III) compound (HAuF₄), matching the 1:1 molar ratio described. The product, HAuF₂, is our substance A5. This compound is known and contains Au(I).\n    *   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"** A5 is HAuF₂. Au(I) compounds are prone to disproportionation in water. A likely reaction is:\n        3HAuF₂(aq) → HAuF₄(aq) + 2Au(s) + 2HF(aq)\n        This reaction produces two main substances containing the elements from A5 (gold): fluoroauric acid (HAuF₄) and solid gold (Au). This matches the final clue.\n\nTherefore, the compound A4 is **HAuF₄ (Fluoroauric acid)**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nNow, we calculate the molecular weight of HAuF₄.\nM(HAuF₄) = M(H) + M(Au) + 4 * M(F)\nM(HAuF₄) = 1.008 + 196.97 + 4 * 19.00\nM(HAuF₄) = 1.008 + 196.97 + 76.00\nM(HAuF₄) = 273.978 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Determine the correct range.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is ~274 g/mol. This falls outside the given options A, B, and C.\nA) 160-180\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 220-240\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy. Let's re-examine the core assumption about the reaction for A5.\n\nThe reaction `Au(s) + AuF₃(s) --(heat)--> ?` is a solid-state reaction. The most likely product would be an intermediate fluoride, Au₃F₅ (AuF₂Au₂F₃). However, the prompt says `a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4`. This strongly implies A4 is a species in solution, not a solid binary fluoride. The HAuF₄ hypothesis remains the most chemically sound interpretation of the clues.\n\nCould A4 be something else? Perhaps A4 is AuF₅ itself dissolved in a non-reactive solvent, and the reaction `Au + AuF₅` occurs. This is less likely, as finding a \"colorless\" solvent that dissolves AuF₅ without reacting is difficult, and the reaction products are not straightforward.\n\nLet's assume our identification of Y=Gold is correct and the logic points to A4=HAuF₄. This gives a molar mass of ~274 g/mol. Let's reconsider the options. It's possible there's an error in the question or the options provided. However, let's look for an alternative that might fit an option.\n\nIf A4 were **AuF₃** (molar mass = 196.97 + 3*19 = 253.97 g/mol). This is still outside all ranges except potentially D if there's some leeway.\nIf the reaction was `2Au + AuF₃ -> 3AuF`, A4=AuF₃. MW=254. Still no fit.\n\nIf Y was **Platinum (Pt)** (MW=195.08 g/mol):\nA2=PtF_n with ɷF = 31.96%.\nLet's check n for Pt: 0.3196 = (19n) / (195.08 + 19n) -> 62.33 + 6.07n = 19n -> 62.33 = 12.93n -> n=4.8. So A2=PtF₅?\nLet's check PtF₅: MW=195.08 + 5*19 = 290.08. ɷF = 95/290.08 = 32.75%. This is also a good fit.\nHowever, platinum is not known to form five binary fluorides (typically PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆ are cited). This makes Pt a weaker candidate than Au. If we proceed with Pt, A4 would likely be H₂PtF₆. M(H₂PtF₆) = 2 + 195 + 6*19 = 311 g/mol. This is also outside all options.\n\nGiven the strong chemical evidence pointing towards Y=Au and A4=HAuF₄, and the calculated molecular weight of ~274 g/mol, it appears there may be an error in the provided options. If forced to choose the \"closest\" range without exceeding it, one might be tempted by D, but the number is too high. If the substance A4 was AuF₃ (MW ~254 g/mol), it's also not in any range.\n\nThere must be an interpretation we are missing, or the question's data is flawed. Let's revisit the prompt's data on A2. `ɷF=31.96%`. Our calculation led to M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nWhat if A4 is A2? The problem doesn't forbid it. If A4=A2=AuF₅, then MW=292. No fit.\n\nLet's trust our initial calculation and reasoning. Y=Au, A4=HAuF₄, MW=274 g/mol. The options provided seem incorrect.\nLet's re-read the question carefully. \"Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.\"\n\nLet's hypothesize A4 is **AuF₃** (MW = 253.97 g/mol). Let's see if the reaction can work. `Au + AuF₃ -> ...` in 1:1 ratio. This does not lead to a known stable gold fluoride. So A4 is unlikely to be AuF₃.\n\nThe conclusion remains that A4 is most likely HAuF₄, with a MW of ~274 g/mol. None of the options contains this value. Let's re-examine the options and my calculation.\nH = 1, Au = 197, F = 19. M = 1 + 197 + 4*19 = 198 + 76 = 274. The calculation is correct.\n\nThere is no way to reconcile the chemical evidence with the provided options.\nIf we assume option D is correct (220-240), what substance could it be?\nLet's search for gold fluorides or related species in that range.\n- AuF: 197+19 = 216 g/mol. If A4=AuF, could the reaction `Au + AuF -> ` in a 1:1 ratio make sense? No.\n- HAuF₂ (A5 from our derivation): 1+197+2*19 = 236 g/mol. This is in the range 220-240. But A4 cannot be HAuF₂, as it is the product A5.\n\nThis indicates a probable error in the question, either A4 and A5 are swapped in the description, or the range is for A5, not A4. If the question asked for the MW of A5 (which we identified as HAuF₂), the answer would be ~236 g/mol, falling perfectly into range D.\n\nGiven the context of a multiple-choice question, this type of error is common. The logic identifying A5 as HAuF₂ is sound. The logic identifying A4 as HAuF₄ is also sound. The numbers just don't match the options for A4, but they do for A5. Let's assume the question mistakenly asks for the range for A4 when it meant A5.\nMW(A5) = MW(HAuF₂) ≈ 236 g/mol. This is within the range of 220-240.\n\nHowever, we must answer the question as written. No sound chemical reasoning leads to A4 having a MW in any of the provided ranges, with the most likely candidate (HAuF₄, MW≈274) and the next most likely (AuF₃, MW≈254) both falling outside all options. This implies the question is flawed. Without a valid path to any of the answers, no selection can be made with confidence. But if forced to select the least wrong answer based on a plausible typo: the molecular weight of the *product* A5 (HAuF₂) is ~236 g/mol, which fits in range D. This seems like the intended answer, assuming a typo in the question's target molecule.\n\nThere is no logical path to select D for substance A4. Given the constraint to provide an answer, and the high likelihood of a flawed question, this is an intractable problem. But if a choice must be made, it's a guess based on the question intending to ask for A5. This is a very weak basis for an answer. Let's step back and consider if AuF₃ could be HAuF₄ if some waters of hydration were present, but that complicates things. Let's just go with the most likely scenario, a typo. MW(A5) = 236 g/mol, so the intended answer is likely D. But this is for A5, not A4. Let's mark D with this strong caveat.\n\nLet me try to find a scenario where MW(A4) is in the 220-240 range. The only possibility would be that A4 is A5's precursor from a different reaction, and A5 is something else. But the 1:1 reaction of Au + A4 -> A5 is a very strong clue for comproportionation, and the HAuF₄ -> HAuF₂ pathway is very compelling. The logic seems to much stronger than the provided options.\n\nLet me select the option based on a probable typo in the question, as it's the only way to reach a provided choice.\n- **Identify A5**: HAuF₂, M=236 g/mol.\n- **Identify A4**: HAuF₄, M=274 g/mol.\n- The question asks for the range for A4.\n- The options are A) 160-180, B) 140-160, C) 110-130, D) 220-240.\n- Range D contains the molecular weight of A5.\n- Let's assume the question meant to ask for A5.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a fluorine content (ωF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of this binary fluoride be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 18.998 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = (n * M(F) * (1 - ωF)) / ωF\nM(Y) = (n * 18.998 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45 g/mol\n\nWe can now test integer values for n to find plausible molar masses for Y and check them against the periodic table:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca, 40.08) or Scandium (Sc, 44.96).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.90) or Krypton (Kr, 83.80).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is close to Terbium (Tb, 158.9) or Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5).\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol. This is near Mercury (Hg, 200.6), Thallium (Tl, 204.4) or Lead (Pb, 207.2).\n*   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, common isotopes 239-244) or Americium (Am, 243).\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical fluorine percentage for the most likely candidates:\n*   **KrF2** (n=2, Y=Kr): M(KrF2) = 83.80 + 2*18.998 = 121.8 g/mol. ωF = (38.0/121.8) = 31.2%. This is a reasonable match.\n*   **SbF3** (n=3, Y=Sb): M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*18.998 = 178.75 g/mol. ωF = (57.0/178.75) = 31.89%. This is a very close match.\n*   **PuF6** (n=6, Y=Pu). Using Pu-244 isotope: M(PuF6) = 244 + 6*19 = 358 g/mol. ωF = (114/358) = 31.84%. Using Pu-242 isotope: M(PuF6) = 242.06 + 6*18.998 = 356.05 g/mol. ωF = (113.99/356.05) = 32.01%. This is also an extremely close match.\n\n**Step 2: Use the other chemical properties to identify Y and its fluorides.**\n\nThe problem provides several clues:\n*   A bright-red substance **A1** decomposes at room temperature (293 K) into **A2** and fluorine gas (F2).\n*   **A1** and **A3** are strong oxidizing agents that can react with xenon.\n*   **Y** forms five known binary fluorides.\n\nLet's evaluate our candidates based on these clues:\n*   **Candidate Kr**: Five fluorides of Krypton are not known (only KrF2 is well-established). Also, for A1 to decompose into A2 (KrF2) and F2, A1 must be KrF4. KrF4 is believed to be a colorless solid, not \"bright-red\". So Krypton is unlikely.\n*   **Candidate Sb**: Antimony mainly forms SbF3 and SbF5. The existence of five distinct binary compounds is not well-established. For A1 to decompose to A2 (SbF3) and F2, A1 must be a higher fluoride like SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid and is stable at room temperature, it does not decompose at 293 K. This contradicts the description of A1. So Antimony is unlikely.\n*   **Candidate Pu**: Plutonium is known to form at least five binary fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, Pu2F9). PuF6 is a strong oxidizing agent (reacts with Xe) and is described as a reddish-brown solid which is a plausible match for \"bright-red\". Crucially, PuF6 is thermally unstable and decomposes at room temperature into PuF4 and F2 gas (PuF6 → PuF4 + F2).\n\nThis set of properties provides a strong match for:\n*   **Y = Plutonium (Pu)**\n*   **A1 = Plutonium hexafluoride (PuF6)**\n*   **A2 = Plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4)**\n*   **A3 = PuF6** (it is also a strong oxidizing agent and is formed by fluorinating Pu).\n\nThere is a conflict: The decomposition A1(PuF6) → A2(PuF4) fits perfectly, but the mass percentage given for A2 (31.96%) matches A1(PuF6), not A2(PuF4) which has ωF ≈ 24%. This is likely a common type of error in chemical problems where a property is misattributed. Given that all other chemical facts point strongly to the PuF6/PuF4 identification, we will proceed assuming the mass percentage was meant for A1, not A2.\n\n**Step 3: Identify substance A4.**\n\nWe now need to identify A4 based on the final clue: \"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes the reaction: Pu + A4 → A5 (1:1 mole ratio)\n\nA4 is another binary fluoride of plutonium. The known fluorides are PuF3, PuF4, PuF6. (We also know PuF5 and Pu2F9 exist).\n*   A1 and A3 are PuF6, so A4 is not PuF6.\n*   A2 is PuF4, so A4 is not PuF4.\n*   This leaves **A4 = PuF3**.\n\nLet's check if the reaction makes sense with A4 = PuF3. The problem statement describes adding elemental Pu to a solution of A4. The 1:1 molar ratio suggests a reaction where Pu metal reduces a higher oxidation state fluoride. However, adding Pu(0) to PuF3 (Pu in +3 state) would not involve a simple 1:1 comproportionation to form a stable intermediate fluoride.\nLet's reconsider the wording \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4\". This could describe the preparation of a mixed-valence compound. Indeed, the compound known as Pu2F9 is more accurately represented as [Pu(III)F2]n[Pu(V)F7]n or a similar structure, but it is formed from PuF3 and PuF6.\n\nThere seems to be ambiguity or a simplification in the reaction description. However, following the process of elimination based on identifying A1, A2, and A3, the most logical remaining candidate for A4 is **PuF3**.\n\nThe question is about the solution of A4 being \"colorless\". Plutonium ions are famous for having colored solutions (Pu(III) is blue/violet, Pu(IV) is yellow-brown). A colorless solution is unexpected. This is another significant inconsistency in the problem statement. However, given the options, we must select the most plausible path. Eliminating the already identified fluorides is the most logical step.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nAssuming A4 is PuF3:\n*   Molar mass of Pu (using the most common isotope for calculation, Pu-239): 239.05 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of F: 18.998 g/mol.\n*   Molecular weight of PuF3 = M(Pu) + 3 * M(F) = 239.05 + 3 * 18.998 = 239.05 + 56.994 = **296.044 g/mol**.\n\nUsing the isotope Pu-244 gives M(PuF3) = 244 + 57 = 301 g/mol. Regardless of the isotope, the molecular weight is near 300.\n\nLet's re-examine the question. Perhaps my assignment of A1/A2 is wrong and A4 is something else.\nWhat if A2=SbF3 is correct, and all the properties of A1 are wrong?\nY = Sb, A2=SbF3, A1=SbF5, A3=SbF5. Then A4 could be... there are only two fluorides. A4 and A5 would have to be SbF3 and SbF5.\nIf A4 = SbF5, the reaction is Sb + SbF5 (1:1). Sb(0) + Sb(+5) -> No simple 1:1 product.\nIf A4 = SbF3, the reaction is Sb + SbF3 (1:1). Sb(0) + Sb(+3) -> No simple 1:1 product.\nThe antimony hypothesis leads to dead ends.\n\nLet's return to the most likely, though flawed, Plutonium hypothesis:\nY=Pu, A1=PuF6, A2=PuF4, A3=PuF6.\nThe remaining major fluorides are PuF3 and PuF5. Let's consider A4 could be either.\nMW(PuF3) ≈ 296-301 g/mol.\nMW(PuF5) = 244 + 5*19 = 339 g/mol.\n\nThe provided answer choices are:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 160-180\nD) 220-240\n\nNone of the molecular weights for PuF3 or PuF5 fit into these ranges. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or a severe error in the problem as interpreted.\n\nLet's re-read everything one last time. There must be another interpretation.\nMaybe the element Y is something different, and my initial scan was incomplete. What if the description of A1 being \"bright-red\" and decomposing at RT is the key? This strongly points away from SbF5 and KrF4. It fits PuF6 very well. Let's trust this clue above all others. If A1 is PuF6, then Y=Pu.\nIf Y=Pu, the binary fluorides are PuF3, PuF4, PuF6...\nLet's assume the molecular weights in the options (A,B,C,D) must be correct for A4.\nIf MW(A4) is in range D (220-240), could it be a Pu compound? No. The lightest is PuF3 (~296).\nThis means Y cannot be Pu. This is a total contradiction.\n\nLet's reconsider Sb. Y=Sb. A2=SbF3 (MW ≈ 178.8, %F=31.89%).\nLet's assume the descriptions of A1 are wrong, but A2=SbF3 is correct because the math is the tightest fit.\nA1 would be SbF5. A3 would be SbF5. A4 would have to be either SbF3 or SbF5.\nMW(SbF3) = 178.8 g/mol. This falls in range C (160-180).\nMW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5*19 = 216.76 g/mol.\nThe reaction Sb + A4 -> A5 (1:1). Still problematic.\n\nWhat about Chlorine? ClF, ClF3, ClF5. Only 3 fluorides.\nA2=ClF_n, %F=31.96.\nLet's check: %F in ClF3 = (3*19)/(35.5+57) = 57/92.5 = 61.6%. No.\nWhat about Bromine again? Y=Br, A2 = ???. The %F doesn't match any stable fluoride.\n\nLet's go back to Sb. Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. MW(A2)=178.8. Let's assume A1=SbF5 despite the wrong color and stability. Let A4 be SbF5. MW(SbF5)=216.76. Doesn't fit the ranges well. Let A4 be SbF3. MW=178.8, fits range C.\nLet's test this scenario: **A4 = SbF3**.\nThe reaction is: Sb + SbF3 (in 1:1 ratio) -> A5.\nThis reaction doesn't seem to lead to a known antimony fluoride, A5.\nThe puzzle is deeply flawed. However, in such contest problems, sometimes one must choose the \"least wrong\" path. The match between SbF3 and the mass percentage for A2 is numerically excellent (31.89% vs 31.96%).\nLet's assume:\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A2 = SbF3 (from mass%)\n*   A1 = SbF5 (highest fluoride, strong oxidizer/superacid reacts with Xe) -> ignore color/stability problems.\n*   A3 = SbF5 (same logic)\n*   The known fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5. Let's assume others like SbF4 exist to meet the \"five fluorides\" criteria.\n*   A4 and A5 are SbF3 and SbF5.\n*   \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". SbF5 is a liquid, SbF3 is a solid. It could be a solution of SbF3 in liquid SbF5 or another solvent. Both SbF3 and SbF5 are colorless.\n*   If **A4 = SbF5**, MW=216.8 g/mol. Closest range is D (220-240). Let's check reaction: Sb + SbF5 -> A5 (1:1). Comproportionation could lead to SbF3. Let's balance: 2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3. The ratio is not 1:1.\n*   If **A4 = SbF3**, MW=178.8 g/mol. This falls squarely in range **C (160-180)**. Let's check reaction: Sb + SbF3 -> A5 (1:1). Not a standard reaction.\n\nLet's try one final radical idea. Let's re-read this: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" What if A4 is Y itself dissolved in something, and A5 is the fluoride? This is not how the sentence is structured. A4 is clearly a distinct substance from Y.\n\nGiven the irreconcilable contradictions in the Plutonium path (molecular weight ranges) and the chemical reaction problems in the Antimony path, let's focus only on the molecular weights. The calculation for A2 yielded SbF3 as a very strong candidate. The MW of SbF3 is 178.8. If we assume A4 is SbF3, it fits range C. The MW of SbF5 is 216.8. If A4 is SbF5, it is closest to range D. The description of A4 having a \"colorless concentrated solution\" might favor the liquid SbF5 over the solid SbF3. If A4 = SbF5, its molecular weight is 216.8 g/mol. This is close to the range 220-240.\n\nHowever, let's revisit the prompt with another element: Rhenium (Re). M=186.2 g/mol. Known fluorides: ReF4, ReF5, ReF6, ReF7.\nA2 = ReF_n, %F=31.96. If n=4, M(Y) = 161.8 (No). If n=5, M(Y) = 202.25 (No).\nIf we test ReF6: %F = (6*19)/(186.2 + 114) = 114/300.2 = 38%. No.\n\nLet's go back to Y=Sb and A2=SbF3. MW(SbF3) = 178.8 (in range C). A4=SbF3 is a possibility.\nLet's try Y=Sb and A2=SbF5? %F in SbF5 = (5*19)/(121.8+95) = 95/216.8 = 43.8%. No.\n\nThe most consistent numerical data point is A2=SbF3. If we assume one of the other fluorides must be A4, the only other common option is SbF5 (MW=216.8 g/mol). This falls just outside range D, but is closest to it. What if we are looking for the MW of A3? No, it asks for A4.\n\nLet's assume A4=SbF5 and there's some slight inaccuracy in the provided ranges. MW=216.8 is closest to D.\n\nBut there is another possibility. Let's check what A5 might be. What if Y+A4=A5 means Pu + PuF6 -> PuF4 + PuF3 ... this is getting too speculative.\n\nLet's retry Y=Au (Gold), M=197. n=5, M(Y)=202. %F in AuF5 = 32.5%. Close-ish.\nA1=AuF7? (red solid, unstable) decomposes to AuF5+F2. A2=AuF5. %F=32.5% is close to 31.96%. Five fluorides not known. A1(AuF7) oxidizes Xe. This is a plausible path.\nY=Au. A1=AuF7. A2=AuF5. A3=AuF7.\nA4 must be another gold fluoride. AuF3 is known. MW(AuF3)=197 + 3*19 = 254. This is not in any range.\n\nGiven the severe inconsistencies, let's reconsider Y=Sb. A2=SbF3. A4 is likely SbF5 or SbF3. MW(SbF3) = 178.8 (Range C). MW(SbF5)=216.8 (Closest to D). Let's think about the last sentence. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\nIf Y=Sb, A4=SbF5, the reaction with Sb to give A5 is unclear. But let's check the hydrolysis of antimony fluorides. SbF5 + 2H2O -> SbO2F + 4HF. (Two substances). SbF3 + H2O -> SbOF + 2HF (Two substances). So this doesn't help distinguish.\n\nLet's assume A4 = SbF5 (as a liquid, it can be a \"concentrated solution\" of itself). MW=216.8 g/mol.\nThe range 220-240 is very close. This is a plausible, though not perfect, choice.\n\nFinal Check: Let's assume A4 falls in range B (140-160).\nCould A4 be TeF6? M(TeF6) = 127.6 + 6*19 = 241.6. No.\nCould A4 be MoF6? M(MoF6) = 96 + 114 = 210. No.\nWhat compound could have MW 140-160? BrF5 = 175 (No). IF3=184 (No).\nThe element Y must be heavy for its fluorides to reach these molecular weights. The Y=Sb path seems the most likely intended solution despite its flaws. And if so, A4 is likely SbF5 (the other major fluoride), placing its molecular weight near range D.\n\nLet's reconsider the ranges and my calculation for SbF5. M(SbF5)=216.76. Range D is 220-240. The difference is 3.24. This is a small discrepancy. Let's assume this is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YF_n) with a fluorine weight percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can establish a relationship between the molar mass of Y (M_Y) and the number of fluorine atoms (n).\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 18.9984 g/mol.\n    The formula for weight percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    0.3196 = (n * 18.9984) / (M_Y + n * 18.9984)\n    By rearranging the formula, we can solve for M_Y:\n    M_Y = (n * 18.9984 / 0.3196) - (n * 18.9984)\n    M_Y = (59.444 * n) - (18.9984 * n)\n    M_Y ≈ 40.446 * n\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer n (a plausible oxidation state) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to K, Ca)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Br)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.3 g/mol (Very close to Antimony, Sb, with M = 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Close to Dy)\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.2 g/mol (Between Au and Tl/Pb)\n    *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Close to Pu, Am)\n\n    Let's verify the fluorine percentage for the most likely candidate, Antimony (Sb) with n=3.\n    A2 would be SbF3.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 18.9984) / (121.760 + 3 * 18.9984) * 100%\n    ɷF(SbF3) = 56.9952 / 178.7552 * 100% = 31.88%\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a relative difference of only 0.25%. This is the best fit among all plausible elements. So we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compounds A1 and A3.**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (room temperature) into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine (F2). The reaction is `A1 -> SbF3 + F2`. For this reaction to be balanced, A1 must have a higher fluorine-to-antimony ratio than SbF3. The most common and stable higher fluoride of antimony is SbF5. So, the reaction would be `SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2`. This makes **A1 = SbF5**.\n    *   There are some inconsistencies: SbF5 is a colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid, and its decomposition to SbF3 requires high temperatures (~400 °C), not 293 K. These are likely inaccuracies in the problem statement, which is common in complex chemistry puzzles.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. SbF5 is a very strong oxidizing agent and Lewis acid, known to react with xenon (e.g., `XeF2 + 2SbF5 -> [XeF][Sb2F11]`). This property strongly supports A1 being SbF5.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Sb) and also interacts with xenon. This also points to the strongest oxidizing agent, so **A3 = SbF5**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5.**\n    *   The problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   Here, Y = Sb. So the reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5` with `n(Sb) : n(A4) = 1:1`.\n    *   A4 is a binary fluoride of antimony. The two main candidates are SbF3 and SbF5.\n    *   This type of reaction, involving an element and its compound to form a compound of intermediate oxidation state, is a comproportionation. Let's analyze the possibilities.\n        *   If A4 = SbF5, the reaction would be `2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3`. This is a known reaction, but the molar ratio of reactants is `Sb : SbF5 = 2:3`, which is not the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n        *   If A4 = SbF3, the reaction is `Sb + SbF3 -> A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio. This fits the stoichiometry perfectly. A5 would be a subfluoride like `Sb2F3` or more simply represented as `SbF`.\n    *   Let's check other properties. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". If **A4 = SbF3**, it is a colorless (or white) solid and is soluble in solvents like HF, so a colorless solution is plausible.\n    *   The final clue is that A5 decomposes in water into two substances. A subfluoride like SbF (antimony in +1 oxidation state) would be unstable in water and would disproportionate into elemental antimony (Sb, oxidation state 0) and an antimony(III) compound (e.g., Sb2O3 or SbF3). This fits the description.\n    *   Therefore, the most consistent identification is **A4 = SbF3**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    We have identified A4 as antimony trifluoride (SbF3). Let's calculate its molecular weight.\n    M_Y = M_Sb = 121.76 g/mol\n    M_F = 18.998 g/mol\n    MW(A4) = MW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 ≈ 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol. We check which of the given ranges contains this value.\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 110-130\n    The value 178.76 falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown element Y and the compounds A1 through A5.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    Let the formula of the binary compound A2 be YF_n.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    We are given ɷF = 31.96% = 0.3196. The molar mass of Fluorine, M(F), is approximately 18.998 g/mol.\n    0.3196 = (n * 18.998) / (M(Y) + n * 18.998)\n    Rearranging for the molar mass of element Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 18.998 = n * 18.998\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 18.998 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 18.998 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (18.998 * 0.6804 / 0.3196)\n    M(Y) ≈ n * 40.4 g/mol\n\n    Now we can test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms):\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.4 g/mol. This corresponds to Calcium (Ca) or Argon (Ar). These elements do not fit the described chemistry (e.g., forming five fluorides, powerful oxidizing agents).\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.8 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol) and Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.2 g/mol. This is close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.4 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu-242 isotope).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates for Y based on other clues.**\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** If A2 = SbF₃, the calculated ɷF is (3*19)/(121.8+57) = 31.88%. This is a very close match. However, Sb only forms two well-known binary fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. Also, its fluorides are colorless, but A1 is described as \"bright-red\".\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** If A2 = PuF₆ (with  Pu-242 isotope, M=242.05), the calculated ɷF is (6*19)/(242.05+114) = 32.01%. This is an excellent match. The problem is the decomposition \"A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine\". This means A1 has a higher fluorine content than A2. If A2=PuF₆, A1 would need to be PuFₙ with n>6, which is unknown and highly unlikely.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Let's check this candidate. If Y=Kr, then A2 is likely KrF₂.\n        Let's calculate the mass percentage of F in KrF₂: M(Kr) = 83.8 g/mol.\n        ɷF(KrF₂) = (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 = 0.3120 = 31.20%.\n        This value is reasonably close to the given 31.96% (a relative difference of about 2.4%). Given the complexities, this might be an acceptable discrepancy.\n\n3.  **Test the Krypton (Y=Kr) hypothesis with all the given information.**\n    *   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" This is a known inconsistency in this classic problem. Krypton mainly forms KrF₂ and the highly unstable KrF₄. We will assume this is an inaccuracy in the problem statement.\n    *   \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine.\" If A2=KrF₂, the decomposition A1 → A2 + F₂ suggests A1 = KrF₄. KrF₄ is known to be unstable and decompose into KrF₂ and F₂. However, KrF₄ is a white solid, not \"bright-red\". This is another known inaccuracy in this problem.\n    *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" KrF₄ is an exceptionally strong oxidizing agent, much stronger than XeF₄, and can oxidize Xenon. This fits.\n    *   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\" Direct fluorination of Krypton gives Krypton difluoride (Kr + F₂ → KrF₂). So, A3 = KrF₂.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" KrF₂ is a strong fluorinating agent and can react with other substances, which can in turn react with Xenon. For example, it reacts with Lewis acids like SbF₅ to form salts like [KrF]⁺[SbF₆]⁻, which are powerful xenon oxidizers. This fits.\n\n4.  **Identify substance A4.**\n    So far, the hypothesis Y=Kr seems the most plausible despite inaccuracies in the description.\n    A1=KrF₄, A2=KrF₂, A3=KrF₂, Y=Kr.\n    The final piece of information is: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    This translates to: Kr(g) + A4(solution) → A5.\n    A4 must be a substance that can react with elemental Krypton in a 1:1 ratio. Since Krypton is very unreactive, A4 must be a very powerful oxidizing agent itself and likely a strong Lewis acid. The solution is colorless. We are looking for the molecular weight of A4.\n    Let's examine the options for the molecular weight of A4.\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 110-130\n\n    We need a colorless substance that is a powerful oxidizer, likely a fluoride, with a molecular weight in one of these ranges.\n    Let's check for suitable compounds in range A (160-180 g/mol):\n    *   **XeF₂ (Xenon difluoride):** Molar mass = 131.29 + 2 * 18.998 = 169.29 g/mol. This falls perfectly within the range [160-180]. XeF₂ is a colorless solid that forms colorless solutions in anhydrous HF.\n    *   **AsF₅ (Arsenic pentafluoride):** Molar mass = 74.92 + 5 * 18.998 = 169.91 g/mol. This also falls perfectly within the range. It is a colorless gas but can be used in solution (e.g., in HF).\n\n    Both XeF₂ and AsF₅ are powerful oxidizing agents/Lewis acids and have molecular weights fitting the range A. While the reaction Kr + XeF₂ → KrXeF₂ is speculative, it provides a logical path to the answer. The problem is constructed such that these considerations lead to a specific answer range.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The chain of deduction, despite some inconsistencies in the problem's descriptive text (color, number of compounds), strongly points towards Y=Krypton. This identification then allows us to identify plausible candidates for substance A4 (such as XeF₂ or AsF₅), whose molecular weights (≈169 g/mol) fall squarely into the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nBased on the chemical information and calculations, we can deduce the identities of the compounds and answer the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Compound A2**: We are given that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), and the mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) is 31.96%.\n    *   Let the atomic mass of Y be M_Y and the atomic mass of fluorine be M_F (≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n    *   Let the chemical formula of A2 be YF_n.\n    *   The formula for mass percentage is: `ωF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)`\n    *   Substituting the values: `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + 19.00n)`\n    *   Rearranging to solve for M_Y: `M_Y = (19.00n / 0.3196) - 19.00n` which simplifies to `M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n`.\n    *   We test integer values for `n`:\n        *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 (Ca, Ar - unlikely)\n        *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 (Se, Br - possible)\n        *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35. This value is extremely close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   Let's verify this by calculating the mass percentage of fluorine in SbF3:\n        *   Molar mass of SbF3 = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n        *   ωF = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    *   This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y = Sb (Antimony)** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A4**: The problem states that A4 is one of five binary compounds of Antimony and Fluorine. The most common antimony fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5.\n\n3.  **Calculate Molecular Weights**: Let's calculate the molecular weights (MW) of the two most likely candidates for A4.\n    *   **MW of SbF3**: 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = **178.754 g/mol**\n    *   **MW of SbF5**: 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = **216.75 g/mol**\n\n4.  **Match with Given Options**: Now, we compare these molecular weights to the ranges provided in the options:\n    *   A) 220-240\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 160-180\n\n    The calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.754 g/mol) fits perfectly within the range **D) 160-180**. The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.75 g/mol) does not fit any of the ranges provided.\n\nTherefore, compound A4 must be SbF3. The question asks for the range in which its molecular weight falls.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and Fluorine (F), with a formula YFₙ. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and 'n' is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\n    Let's rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (19.00 × n) / (M(Y) + 19.00 × n)\n    0.3196 × (M(Y) + 19n) = 19n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 12.9276n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    Now we test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass M(Y):\n    *   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to Calcium, Ca)\n    *   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (Close to Bromine, Br)\n    *   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Close to Antimony, Sb, with M = 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (Close to Dysprosium, Dy)\n    *   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Close to Mercury, Hg, or Gold, Au)\n    *   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.70 g/mol (Close to Plutonium, Pu, or Americium, Am)\n\n    Antimony (Sb) for n=3 is a very strong candidate. Let's check the mass percentage in SbF₃ more accurately. Antimony has two major isotopes: ¹²¹Sb (mass 120.90 u) and ¹²³Sb (mass 122.90 u). Let's calculate the fluorine percentage using the lighter isotope ¹²¹Sb, which might be used in a specific synthesis.\n    A2 = ¹²¹SbF₃\n    M(¹²¹SbF₃) = 120.90 + 3 × 19.00 = 177.90 g/mol\n    ɷF = (3 × 19.00) / 177.90 = 57 / 177.90 ≈ 0.3204 = 32.04%\n    This value (32.04%) is extremely close to the given 31.96%. The small difference can be attributed to rounding or the use of slightly different atomic mass values. This confirms with high probability that Y = Antimony (Sb) and A2 = SbF₃.\n\n2.  **Identify the other substances based on Y = Sb.**\n    *   **Y = Sb**\n    *   **A2 = SbF₃** (Antimony(III) fluoride)\n    *   **A1**: The problem states `A1 → A2 + F₂`. This means A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony that decomposes into SbF₃ and fluorine. The next stable higher fluoride is SbF₅.\n        So, **A1 = SbF₅** (Antimony(V) fluoride).\n    *   **Check other clues**:\n        *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon\": SbF₅ is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and a component of fluoroantimonic acid, which is known to react with and oxidize xenon. This fits.\n        *   \"A1 is a bright-red substance\": SbF₅ is actually a colorless viscous liquid. This is a known inconsistency in this classic problem, likely an error in the problem statement intended to mislead. Given the strong numerical evidence for Sb, we proceed by noting this discrepancy.\n        *   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with Y\": Antimony is only known to form two stable binary fluorides, SbF₃ and SbF₅. This is another likely error in the problem statement.\n    *   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" The highest fluoride is formed by direct fluorination, and it's the strongest oxidizing agent.\n        So, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and determine its molecular weight.**\n    *   The problem asks for the molecular weight range of **A4**. A4 must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony. The choices are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   Let's calculate their molecular weights using the standard atomic weight of Sb (121.76 g/mol):\n        *   **MW(SbF₃)** = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 121.76 + 57 = **178.76 g/mol**\n        *   **MW(SbF₅)** = 121.76 + 5 × 19.00 = 121.76 + 95 = **216.76 g/mol**\n    *   Now, let's look at the given options for the molecular weight range:\n        A) 110-130\n        B) 140-160\n        C) 160-180\n        D) 220-240\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely within the range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the ranges. It is close to range D, but outside of it.\n    *   This strongly implies that **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n4.  **Final check of the remaining chemical reaction.**\n    The last piece of information is: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 (SbF₃), A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n    *   This describes the reaction of antimony metal with antimony(III) fluoride to form a sub-fluoride (a compound where Sb has an oxidation state between 0 and +3). Such sub-halides are known to be unstable and to disproportionate in water. For instance, a hypothetical `Sb₂F₃` (formed from `Sb + SbF₃`) would react with water to disproportionate into elemental antimony (Sb⁰) and an antimony(III) compound (like Sb₂O₃ or Sb(OH)₃), which could be the \"two substances\" mentioned (or a solid mixture and an aqueous solution). This description is chemically plausible for A4 being SbF₃.\n\nConclusion: Based on the strong numerical evidence from the mass percentage and the process of elimination using the provided molecular weight ranges, A4 is SbF₃. Its molecular weight is approximately 178.8 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (let's call it YF_n_), and its mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    where M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M_Y is the molar mass of element Y.\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\n    0.3196 = (19n) / (M_Y + 19n)\n    0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 19n - 6.0724n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 12.9276n\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find plausible molar masses for Y.\n    *   n = 1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (matches Sc, K, Ca, Ar - not ideal candidates for the described chemistry).\n    *   n = 2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (matches Br, Se - bromine forms BrF3, BrF5, but %F don't match).\n    *   n = 3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n = 4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (matches Dy).\n    *   n = 6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (matches Pu).\n\n    Let's check the fluorine percentage for SbF3:\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    %F = (3 * 19.00 / 178.76) * 100 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n    So, it is highly likely that **Y = Sb (Antimony)** and **A2 = SbF3 (Antimony trifluoride)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A3.**\n    A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and it can interact with xenon. Antimony reacts with excess fluorine to form antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). SbF5 is a powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent known to react with xenon (e.g., `Xe + 2SbF5 → [XeF]+[Sb2F11]-`).\n    Therefore, **A3 = SbF5**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5.**\n    We are told that adding Y (Sb) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio produces A5. A4 must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony. The two common ones are SbF3 and SbF5. Both form colorless solutions. Let's analyze both possibilities for A4.\n\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = SbF5**. The reaction would be `Sb + SbF5 → A5`. This is a well-known comproportionation reaction to produce SbF3. The balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3`. Here, A5 would be SbF3. The problem states that A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. SbF3 hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF) (`SbF3 + H2O → SbOF + 2HF`), which perfectly fits the \"two substances\" description.\n        *   **Problem:** The stoichiometry of the reaction is 2:3, not 1:1 as stated in the problem. Also, let's calculate the molecular weight of A4=SbF5: M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fit into any of the provided answer ranges.\n\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = SbF3**.\n        Let's calculate the molecular weight of A4=SbF3: M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        This value, 178.76 g/mol, falls squarely into the range **B) 160-180**. This provides a direct link to one of the answers.\n        *   **Problem:** The reaction `Sb + SbF3 → A5` is chemically unusual, as Sb(0) cannot readily react with Sb(III) in this manner. Furthermore, the likely product (a subfluoride like Sb2F3) would disproportionate in water to give at least three products (e.g., Sb, SbOF, HF), which contradicts the \"two substances\" clue.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    We face a contradiction.\n    *   The path where A4 = SbF5 has more consistent chemistry (reaction mechanism, decomposition of product) but is contradicted by both the stoichiometry and the molecular weight ranges in the answers.\n    *   The path where A4 = SbF3 is chemically problematic but leads to a molecular weight that perfectly matches one of the answer ranges.\n\n    In chemistry puzzles of this nature, it is common for some of the descriptive text (like stoichiometry or qualitative descriptions of reactions) to be simplified or even slightly inaccurate, while the numerical data (mass percentages, molecular weight ranges) are intended to be precise guides to the solution. The fact that M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol fits perfectly in the 160-180 g/mol range is a very strong indication that this is the intended answer. Therefore, we conclude that **A4 is SbF3**.\n\n    The molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is ~178.76 g/mol. This value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is my reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using substance A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote it as YFx) and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    where M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (19.00 * x) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * x)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * x = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n    Here, 'x' is the number of fluorine atoms in A2, which must be a positive integer corresponding to an oxidation state of Y. I will systematically check integer values for 'x' to find a plausible element Y.\n\n2.  **Test potential values of 'x' to find Y:**\n    *   If x=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest is Calcium, Ca=40.08 g/mol, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If x=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Closest is Bromine, Br=79.9 g/mol, but it's a halogen itself).\n    *   If x=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Closest is Antimony, Sb=121.76 g/mol). Let's check this. If A2 is SbF3, its ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   If x=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Closest are Terbium/Dysprosium, but their chemistry is unsuitable).\n    *   If x=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Closest are Gold/Mercury, but the mass percentage match is poorer. For AuF5, ɷF ≈ 32.5%; for HgF5, not a known stable compound).\n    *   If x=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Closest is Plutonium, Pu=244 g/mol). ɷF for PuF6 ≈ 31.84%. This is also a good match.\n\n3.  **Evaluate candidates based on chemical properties:**\n    *   **Candidate Y=Sb**:\n        *   A2 = SbF3. (Matches ɷF).\n        *   A1 decomposes to A2(SbF3) + F2. So A1 would be a higher fluoride, i.e., SbF5. The reaction would be SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2.\n        *   However, A1 is described as a \"bright-red substance\". SbF5 is a colorless liquid/solid. This is a direct contradiction. So, Sb is likely not the element.\n\n    *   **Candidate Y=Pu**:\n        *   Let's check the clues against Plutonium (Pu).\n        *   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\". Plutonium forms at least three well-known binary fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF6). While \"five\" might be specific to the problem's source, the existence of multiple stable fluorides fits.\n        *   A1 is a bright-red substance. PuF6 is described as a volatile reddish-brown solid. This is a plausible match for \"bright-red\".\n        *   A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. The reaction would be A1 -> A2 + F2, meaning A1 is a higher fluoride than A2. The known decomposition of PuF6 is: PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2. This decomposition occurs spontaneously at room temperature (293 K). This perfectly matches the description.\n        *   Therefore: **A1 = PuF6** and **A2 = PuF4**.\n        *   Let's verify the mass percentage for A2=PuF4: ɷF = (4 * 19.00) / (244 + 4 * 19.00) = 76 / 320 = 23.75%. This does **not** match the given 31.96%.\n    *   This leads to a contradiction. It appears there is an inconsistency in the problem statement itself, as the chemical properties (colors, reactions) and the quantitative data (mass %) point to different identities for Y, A1, and A2.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluation and The Most Likely Path:**\n    There is a significant conflict in the provided information. However, often in such problems, the quantitative data (the mass percentage) is the most reliable clue. Let's follow the lead from our calculation: `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x`. The match for Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 (x=3) is exceptionally good (calculated 31.88% vs. given 31.96%). It's possible the description of A1's color is an error or refers to a specific, perhaps impure, state. Let's proceed assuming **Y=Sb** despite the color discrepancy.\n\n    *   **Y = Sb (Antimony)**\n    *   **A2 = SbF3 (Antimony trifluoride)**\n    *   **A1 = SbF5 (Antimony pentafluoride)**, decomposes into A2 and F2 (ignoring the color mismatch).\n    *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon\". SbF5 is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and fluorinating agent. It reacts with xenon to form compounds like [XeF][SbF6], thus oxidizing xenon. This fits.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon\". A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) with fluorine. Sb + F2 -> SbF3 or SbF5. If we need a strong oxidizer, **A3 = SbF5**. This fits.\n    *   Now, the final part: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n    *   This describes the preparation of Antimony oxychloride. Antimony (Sb) dissolves in a hot concentrated solution of Antimony(III) chloride (SbCl3). This must be A4.\n        Reaction: **Sb + SbCl3 -> intermediate species**. However, the classic synthesis of A5 (see below) is adding water to A4.\n    *   Let's reconsider the wording. A more direct reaction that makes sense is the hydrolysis of A4. **A4 is Antimony trichloride, SbCl3.**\n    *   Adding water to a solution of SbCl3 (A4) causes hydrolysis to form antimony oxychloride (SbOCl) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n        Reaction: **SbCl3 (A4) + H2O -> SbOCl (A5) + 2 HCl**\n    *   This A5, Antimony oxychloride (also known as \"algargot powder\"), is a white powder that fits the description of \"A5 decomposing in water to form two substances\" (it forms from water, and its equilibrium involves SbCl3 and Sb2O3/HCl). The description might be slightly imprecise. Let's assume A5 is SbOCl. The \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4\" part is confusing and may be flawed in the problem statement, but SbCl3 is the most logical candidate for A4 in the context of antimony chemistry.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on our deduction, **A4 is Antimony trichloride (SbCl3)**.\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(SbCl3) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(Cl)\n    M(SbCl3) ≈ 121.76 + 3 * 35.453\n    M(SbCl3) ≈ 121.76 + 106.359\n    M(SbCl3) ≈ 228.12 g/mol\n\n6.  **Match with the given range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 228.12 g/mol. This falls squarely within the range given in option B.\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 140-160\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step chemical deduction to identify the unknown substances.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    *   The problem provides the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2 as 31.96% (0.3196). Let the chemical formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is: ɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n    *   Using the atomic weight of fluorine, Ar(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol, we can solve for the atomic weight of Y, Ar(Y):\n        0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (Ar(Y) + n × 19.00)\n        0.3196 × Ar(Y) + 0.3196 × (19.00n) = 19.00n\n        0.3196 × Ar(Y) = 19.00n - 6.0724n\n        0.3196 × Ar(Y) = 12.9276n\n        Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n    *   We can test integer values for n (which represents the oxidation state of Y):\n        *   n=1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (This corresponds to Calcium, Ca)\n        *   n=2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (This corresponds to Bromine, Br, or Selenium, Se)\n        *   n=3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (This is very close to the atomic weight of Antimony, Sb, which is 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   Antimony (Sb) is a plausible candidate. Let's verify the mass fraction for SbF₃.\n        MW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n        ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 × 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is an excellent match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   Therefore, element **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and compound **A2 is Antimony(III) fluoride (SbF₃)**.\n\n2.  **Identify A1 and A3:**\n    *   Substance A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony. The reaction is A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. The most stable higher fluoride is Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF₅. So, **A1 = SbF₅**.\n    *   The fact that A1 oxidizes xenon further supports its identity as SbF₅, a very powerful oxidizing agent.\n    *   Substance A3 is also formed by fluorinating antimony and also oxidizes xenon, which means **A3 is also SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4:**\n    *   Now we need to identify A4. It is one of the five binary compounds of fluorine and antimony. The most common are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   The problem describes a reaction to form A5: Y(Sb) + A4 → A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution.\" Both SbF₃ and SbF₅ are colorless solids that can form solutions.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the possible candidates for A4 and compare them with the given ranges.\n        *   If A4 = SbF₅, MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 × 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n        *   If A4 = SbF₃, MW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    *   Let's look at the given ranges:\n        A) 110-130\n        B) 220-240 (SbF₅ is close but not within this range)\n        C) 160-180\n        D) 140-160\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.754 g/mol) falls perfectly into the range **160-180**. This strongly suggests that A4 is SbF₃.\n\n4.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    *   If A4 is SbF₃, the reaction is Sb + SbF₃ → A5. The product A5 would be an antimony subfluoride or a compound with antimony in a mixed oxidation state. Such a compound would be unstable in water, decomposing into two substances (elemental Sb and an Sb³⁺ compound), which matches the final clue.\n    *   Therefore, compound A4 is SbF₃, and its molecular weight is 178.754 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is my reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   Element Y forms five binary fluorides. Let's call them YFx.\n    *   A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 are five substances related to Y and fluorine. They are strongly implied to be the five binary fluorides.\n    *   A1 (bright-red) decomposes at 293 K into A2 and F2. Reaction: `A1 -> A2 + F2`. This means the oxidation state of Y in A1 is higher than in A2.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96% (0.3196).\n    *   A1 and A3 are strong oxidizing agents, capable of reacting with Xenon.\n    *   A3 is synthesized by `Y + F2 -> A3`.\n    *   A5 is formed from A4 via the reaction: `Y + A4 -> A5` (in solution, 1:1 molar ratio). This must be a reduction of A4 by element Y.\n    *   A5 decomposes in water to form two other substances (hydrolysis).\n    *   The goal is to find the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n2.  **Identify Element Y using the Mass Percentage:**\n    *   The formula for A2 is YFx.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine is given by: `ɷF = (x * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + x * Ar(F))`.\n    *   Rearranging for the atomic weight of Y: `Ar(Y) = x * Ar(F) * (1 - ɷF) / ɷF`.\n    *   Using Ar(F) ≈ 19 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196:\n        `Ar(Y) ≈ x * 19 * (1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196`\n        `Ar(Y) ≈ x * 40.45`\n    *   I will now test integer values of `x` (the number of fluorine atoms) and see if the calculated `Ar(Y)` matches any real elements known to form multiple fluorides.\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    w_F_A2 = 0.3196\n    Ar_F = 18.9984\n\n    # A dictionary of elements and their atomic weights known to form multiple fluorides\n    elements = {\n        'Sb': 121.760, 'Pu': 244.0, 'Dy': 162.50, 'Tb': 158.93,\n        'Se': 78.96, 'Ge': 72.63, 'Sn': 118.71, 'Pb': 207.2,\n        'Re': 186.21, 'Pt': 195.08\n    }\n\n    print(\"Theoretical Ar(Y) for A2 = YFx:\")\n    # Calculate Ar(Y) for different values of x\n    for x in range(1, 8):\n        Ar_Y_calc = x * Ar_F * (1 - w_F_A2) / w_F_A2\n        print(f\"For x={x}, theoretical Ar(Y) = {Ar_Y_calc:.2f}\")\n        # Check for matches\n        for name, real_ar in elements.items():\n            if abs(Ar_Y_calc - real_ar) < 2.0: # Check for close matches\n                 # Now, let's calculate the wF for the actual element fluoride and see how close it is\n                 wF_real = (x * Ar_F) / (real_ar + x * Ar_F)\n                 print(f\"  -> Match candidate: {name} (Ar={real_ar}). If A2={name}F{x}, ɷF = {wF_real*100:.2f}%\")\n    ```\n\n    The python execution will reveal the following:\n    *   For x=3, theoretical Ar(Y) ≈ 121.22. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\n        *   wF(SbF3) = (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 57) ≈ 31.88%. Very close to 31.96%.\n    *   For x=4, theoretical Ar(Y) ≈ 161.63. This is very close to Dysprosium (Dy, 162.50).\n        *   wF(DyF4) = (4 * 19) / (162.50 + 76) ≈ 31.87%. Also very close to 31.96%.\n    *   For x=6, theoretical Ar(Y) ≈ 242.44. This is close to Plutonium (Pu, 244).\n        *   wF(PuF6) = (6 * 19) / (244 + 114) ≈ 31.84%. Close as well.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidates based on the Reaction Stoichiometry:**\n    The crucial clue is the reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` in a **1:1 molar ratio**. This is a comproportionation reaction. For a 1:1 ratio between the element `Y` and the compound `A4`, the reaction must be of the form:\n    `Y + YF(2m) -> 2YFm`\n    This requires element `Y` to have stable fluorides in oxidation states `+m` and `+2m`.\n    Let's check our candidates:\n    *   **Sb:** Forms SbF3 (+3) and SbF5 (+5). The oxidation states are not in a `m` and `2m` relationship. So, this path is invalid.\n    *   **Pu:** Forms PuF3 (+3) and PuF6 (+6). The oxidation states `+3` and `+6` are in a `m=3`, `2m=6` relationship. The reaction would be `Pu + PuF6 -> 2PuF3`.\n        *   This identifies A4=PuF6 and A5=PuF3.\n        *   The problem also gives that A2 has wF=31.96%. Our analysis shows A2 is likely PuF6. So A4=A2. This is consistent.\n        *   However, if A4=PuF6, its molecular weight is `244 + 6*19 = 358` g/mol. This value is not in any of the provided ranges (A-D). This means Y cannot be Pu.\n    *   **Dy:** Forms DyF2 (+2), DyF3 (+3), and DyF4 (+4). The oxidation states `+2` and `+4` are in a `m=2`, `2m=4` relationship. The reaction would be `Dy + DyF4 -> 2DyF2`.\n        *   This fits the 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly.\n        *   This identifies **A4 = DyF4** and A5 = DyF2.\n        *   The problem also gives that A2 has wF=31.96%. Our calculation for DyF4 gives wF=31.87%, which is an excellent match. So, `A2 = A4 = DyF4`. This is perfectly consistent.\n\n4.  **Final Verification and Calculation:**\n    *   Let's assume **Y=Dysprosium (Dy)** and check all the facts.\n    *   `A2 = DyF4`. Mass % matches.\n    *   `A4 = DyF4`. The `Y+A4->A5` reaction is `Dy + DyF4 -> 2DyF2`. Fits perfectly.\n    *   `A5 = DyF2`. `A5` decomposing in water is plausible (`DyF2 + 2H2O -> Dy(OH)2 + 2HF`).\n    *   `A1 -> A2 + F2` becomes `A1 -> DyF4 + F2`. This implies `A1` is a higher fluoride like `DyF5` or `DyF6`. While these are not common, `Dy(IV)` is a known state, so this is chemically plausible within the context of a challenging problem. The color description (\"bright-red\") must be taken as a given property of this specific (possibly hypothetical) substance A1.\n    *   The problem asks for the molecular weight range of **A4**. We have confidently identified A4 as DyF4.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of DyF4.\n        *   Ar(Dy) = 162.50 g/mol\n        *   Ar(F) = 18.998 g/mol\n        *   Mr(DyF4) = Ar(Dy) + 4 * Ar(F) = 162.50 + 4 * 18.998 = 162.50 + 75.992 = **238.492 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (DyF4) is 238.492 g/mol. This value falls within the range given in option D.\n\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 220-240\n\nTherefore, the correct range is 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
