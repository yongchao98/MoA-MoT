Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively.

There were no errors.\n\nHere's a summary of the reasoning:\n1.  The luminosity ratio is given by the formula: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n2.  We are given that $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n3.  The temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$ must be determined from the information about the peak wavelengths.\n4.  According to Wien's Displacement Law, a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its intrinsic peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), so $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n5.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars.\n6.  The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler effect formula: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v/c)$.\n7.  For Star 1, $v_1 = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n8.  For Star 2, $v_2 = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n9.  Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n10. This gives the ratio $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n11. Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n12. Substituting the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity formula gives:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\times (\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c})^4$.\n13. The Python code calculated this value using $v_2 = 700,000$ m/s and the precise value for the speed of light $c$.\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.229. When rounded to two decimal places, this is 2.23. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2, which can be written as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Laws:**\n*   **Luminosity of a Black Body (Stefan-Boltzmann Law):** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is determined by its surface area (A) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is $L = A \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since a star is a sphere, its surface area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$, where R is the radius. So, the full formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Peak Wavelength of a Black Body (Wien's Displacement Law):** The temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which its emission is strongest ($\\lambda_{rest,max}$). The formula is $T = b / \\lambda_{rest,max}$, where 'b' is Wien's constant and $\\lambda_{rest,max}$ is the peak wavelength in the star's own rest frame.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. This is described by the Doppler effect. The relativistic Doppler formula for an object moving away is: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$, where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\nWe can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} $\nThe constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**4. Incorporate the Radius Information:**\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the ratio $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$. Substituting this into our equation:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n*   From Wien's Law, we know that $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest,max}$. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{rest,max,2} / \\lambda_{rest,max,1}$.\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$). We must relate these observed wavelengths to the rest-frame wavelengths using the Doppler effect.\n*   For Star_1, the radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$. This means there is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,max,1}$.\n*   For Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted (redshifted) because it's moving away:\n    $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,max,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n*   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can equate the expressions:\n    $\\lambda_{rest,max,1} = \\lambda_{rest,max,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n*   Now, we can find the ratio of rest-frame wavelengths:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,max,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,max,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n*   This ratio is equal to our temperature ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n**6. Complete the Luminosity Calculation:**\nNow we substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}} \\right)^4 \\right) $\nThis simplifies to:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c} \\right)^2 $\n\n**7. Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\nThe code output confirms the numerical result of this final expression.\n*   $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$\n*   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nThe calculation from the provided code output is `2.2290976580640076`.\n\n**8. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n*   A) ~2.23\n*   B) ~2.25\n*   C) ~2.32\n*   D) ~2.35\n\nThe result 2.229 is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars was extraneous and not needed for this calculation based on black body radiation principles.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe reasoning and calculation have been performed and verified.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  The luminosity ($L$) of a star treated as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n2.  The ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2 is therefore $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$.\n3.  We are given $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n4.  The temperatures are related through Wien's Displacement Law ($\\lambda_{em} \\propto 1/T$) and the Doppler effect ($\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1+v_r/c)$).\n5.  Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$), and Star_1 has zero radial velocity ($v_{r1}=0$), we find the temperature ratio to be $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$.\n6.  Substituting the known values into the luminosity ratio formula gives:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{700 \\text{ km/s}}{c}}\\right)^4$\n7.  The calculation, as performed by the code interpreter in the previous step, yielded a result of approximately 2.229.\n\nThis result rounds to **2.23**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.32\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the problem leads to the following conclusion:\nThe luminosity of a star, assuming it behaves as a black body, is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\nwhere L is the luminosity, R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 and Star 2 ($L_1 / L_2$), we can set up the following equation:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4) = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n*   The radius ratio: $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$, so $(R_1 / R_2) = 1.5$.\n*   The mass ratio: $M_1 = 1.5 * M_2$. This information is not needed for the luminosity calculation based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law and can be ignored.\n*   The radial velocities: $v_1 = 0$ km/s and $v_2 = 700$ km/s.\n*   The observed peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars.\n\nThe temperature of a star is related to its intrinsic peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) by Wien's Displacement Law: $T = b / \\lambda_{rest}$, where b is Wien's constant. This implies that the ratio of temperatures is inversely proportional to the ratio of their rest-frame peak wavelengths:\n$T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{rest, 2} / \\lambda_{rest, 1}$\n\nThe observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity:\n$\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} * (1 + v_r / c)$\nwhere c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star 1, since $v_1 = 0$, its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength:\n$\\lambda_{obs, 1} = \\lambda_{rest, 1}$\n\nFor Star 2, its observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted:\n$\\lambda_{obs, 2} = \\lambda_{rest, 2} * (1 + v_2 / c)$\n\nSince we are told that $\\lambda_{obs, 1} = \\lambda_{obs, 2}$, we can write:\n$\\lambda_{rest, 1} = \\lambda_{rest, 2} * (1 + v_2 / c)$\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the rest wavelengths, which we need for the temperature ratio:\n$\\lambda_{rest, 2} / \\lambda_{rest, 1} = 1 / (1 + v_2 / c)$\n\nTherefore, the temperature ratio is:\n$T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_2 / c)$\n\nNow, we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * [1 / (1 + v_2 / c)]^4$\n\nUsing the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 700 / 300000)]^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * [1 / (1.002333)]^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (0.997672)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 * 0.990714 \\approx 2.2291$\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe code output is `2.229107561148499`.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1.  The luminosity of a star ($L$) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  The ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 and Star 2 is therefore:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n3.  We are given that $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n4.  Wien's Displacement Law states that the temperature of a star is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation ($\\lambda_{emitted, max}$): $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted, max}$. Therefore, $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} / \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1}$.\n5.  The observed peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs, max}$) is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$): $\\lambda_{obs, max} = \\lambda_{emitted, max} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n6.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{obs, max, 2}$.\n7.  For Star 1, $v_{r1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1}$.\n8.  For Star 2, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{obs, max, 2} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n9.  Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{emitted, max, 1} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n10. Rearranging this to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation: $\\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} / \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n11. Therefore, the temperature ratio is $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n12. Substituting this back into the luminosity ratio equation: $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 \\cdot (1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c))^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$.\n13. The Python code calculated this value using $v_{r2} = 700,000$ m/s and $c = 299,792,458$ m/s.\n14. The result is `2.2291...`, which rounds to `2.23`. This matches option A. The information about the mass is irrelevant to this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe user has provided a code output that is very slightly different from the one I generated. This discrepancy is due to using a different value for the speed of light, `c`. The provided output `2.2291075611` is obtained when using the common approximation `c = 3e8 m/s`, while my original calculation used the more precise value `c = 299792458 m/s`.\n\nLet's re-verify the steps and the conclusion.\n\n### Reasoning Breakdown\n\n1.  **Objective:** Calculate the ratio of luminosities, $L_1 / L_2$.\n2.  **Governing Law:** The Stefan-Boltzmann law for a black body states that luminosity ($L$) is proportional to the square of its radius ($R$) and the fourth power of its surface temperature ($T$).\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n3.  **Luminosity Ratio Formula:** The ratio of luminosities is therefore:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\times (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n4.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $(R_1 / R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n5.  **Temperature Ratio:** To find the temperature ratio, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation ($\\lambda_{max,rest}$) in its own rest frame:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{max,rest}$ (where $b$ is Wien's constant).\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of their rest-frame peak wavelengths:\n    $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{max,rest,2} / \\lambda_{max,rest,1}$\n6.  **Doppler Shift:** The problem gives us information about the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,obs}$) and the stars' radial velocities ($v_r$). The observed wavelength is related to the rest-frame wavelength by the Doppler effect:\n    $\\lambda_{rest} = \\lambda_{obs} / (1 + v_r/c)$\n    (A positive velocity indicates movement away from the observer, causing a redshift).\n7.  **Calculating Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   For Star_1, $v_{r,1} = 0$, so its rest-frame wavelength is equal to its observed wavelength: $\\lambda_{max,rest,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. Its rest-frame wavelength is $\\lambda_{max,rest,2} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2} / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Since the problem states that their *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$), we can substitute these into the temperature ratio equation:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = [\\lambda_{max,obs,2} / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)] / \\lambda_{max,obs,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now we combine the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + (700 \\text{ km/s})/c)^4$\n\nThe provided code output `2.2291075611` correctly calculates this value using `c = 3e8 m/s`.\nRounding this result to two decimal places gives 2.23.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reasoning for this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 ($L_1/L_2$):\n    $L_1/L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$, so the ratio of their radii is $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Therefore, $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law and Temperature:** The temperature of a star is related to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation ($\\lambda_{em}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{em}$\n    where b is Wien's constant. This means the temperature is inversely proportional to the peak emitted wavelength, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{em}$.\n    The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{em,2} / \\lambda_{em,1}$\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. However, the temperature depends on the *emitted* wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$), which can be different from the observed one due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). The relationship is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Finding the Emitted Wavelength Ratio:**\n    *   For Star 1: $v_{r1} = 0$, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Since the problem states that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can equate the two expressions:\n        $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Rearranging this gives us the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\lambda_{em,2} / \\lambda_{em,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Since $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{em,2} / \\lambda_{em,1}$, we have:\n    $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    Using the given values:\n    *   $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n    *   $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s\n    The calculation was performed by the Python script, yielding a result of approximately 2.2291.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio $L_1/L_2 \\approx 2.2291$. Comparing this value to the given options:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.25\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.35\n    The result is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reasoning for solving this problem involves combining the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black body radiation with the relativistic Doppler effect.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a spherical black body, is given by the formula:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star\\_1 and Star\\_2, which is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n3.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the *emitted* wavelength at which its radiation is most intense ($\\lambda_{em}$):\n    $\\lambda_{em} = \\frac{b}{T}$ or $T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{em}}$\n    where b is Wien's constant. From this, we can write the temperature ratio as:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}}$\n\n4.  **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. However, Star\\_2 is moving away from us at a high velocity, so its light is redshifted. The relationship between the observed and emitted wavelength is given by the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$\n    where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Connecting the Equations:**\n    *   For Star\\_1, the radial velocity $v_1 = 0$, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   For Star\\_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$.\n    *   We are given that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$. Therefore:\n        $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n    *   This ratio is equal to the temperature ratio:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** We can now substitute the known values and derived ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    *   Radius ratio: $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n    *   Luminosity ratio: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}\\right)^4$\n    *   This simplifies to:\n        $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^2$\n\nUsing the provided code output, which calculates this exact expression:\nThe calculated value for the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.

Therefore, $(R_1 / R_2)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25$.\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the temperatures, $T_1 / T_2$. The temperature is related to the peak wavelength of the star's emission by Wien's displacement law:\n$T = b / \\lambda_{peak, em}$\nwhere b is Wien's constant and $\\lambda_{peak, em}$ is the peak wavelength emitted in the star's rest frame.\n\nThe observed peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{peak, obs}$) is affected by the star's radial velocity (v) due to the Doppler effect:\n$\\lambda_{peak, obs} = \\lambda_{peak, em} * (1 + v/c)$\nwhere c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1, the radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its emitted peak wavelength:\n$\\lambda_{peak, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{peak, em, 1}$\n\nFor Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is:\n$\\lambda_{peak, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{peak, em, 2} * (1 + v_2/c)$\n\nThe problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars:\n$\\lambda_{peak, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{peak, obs, 2}$\n\nTherefore:\n$\\lambda_{peak, em, 1} = \\lambda_{peak, em, 2} * (1 + v_2/c)$\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n$T_1 / T_2 = (b / \\lambda_{peak, em, 1}) / (b / \\lambda_{peak, em, 2}) = \\lambda_{peak, em, 2} / \\lambda_{peak, em, 1}$\n\nSubstituting the relationship we found for the emitted wavelengths:\n$T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{peak, em, 2} / (\\lambda_{peak, em, 2} * (1 + v_2/c)) = 1 / (1 + v_2/c)$\n\nNow we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v_2/c))^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_2/c)^4$\n\nUsing the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c = 299792.458$ km/s, the calculation yields:\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 299792.458)^4 \\approx 2.25 / (1.002335)^4 \\approx 2.25 / 1.00938 \\approx 2.229$\n\nThe code output confirms this result is approximately 2.229.

This peak wavelength is related to the star's intrinsic temperature (T) by Wien's Displacement Law, but we must also account for the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities.\n    *   The relationship between observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) and emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) is given by: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Wien's Law relates the emitted peak wavelength to the temperature: $\\lambda_{em} = b/T$, where b is Wien's constant.\n\n5.  **Applying to Both Stars:**\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1} = b/T_1$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c) = (b/T_2)(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n\n6.  **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We are told that the observed peak wavelengths are the same:\n    $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$\n    $b/T_1 = (b/T_2)(1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Canceling b, we get:\n    $1/T_1 = (1/T_2)(1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Rearranging to find the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$:\n    $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute this temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$\n\n    The Python code executed this calculation with the given values:\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n    *   $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s\n    *   $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$\n\n    The output of the calculation was `2.229107561148499`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value of the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.

Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_1 / L_2$).\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles:**\n*   **Luminosity and the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** For a star that radiates as a perfect black body, its total luminosity ($L$) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4 = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $R$ is the star's radius, $T$ is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Peak Wavelength and Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature ($T$) of a star is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{rest}$). This is described by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{rest}$\n    where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant and $\\lambda_{rest}$ is the wavelength emitted by the star in its own reference frame (i.e., not affected by its motion relative to us).\n\n*   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The wavelength we observe ($\\lambda_{obs}$) from a moving star is shifted from its emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to the Doppler effect. For speeds much less than the speed of light ($c$), the relationship is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r / c)$\n    where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if moving toward).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars, we can write the ratio of their luminosities:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} $\n\nThe constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 $\n\n**4. Determine the Known Ratios from the Problem Statement:**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}) = 1.5$.\n    This means $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25$.\n    *Note: The mass information is not required for this calculation and can be ignored.*\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We must use the information about the peak wavelengths.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is related to the rest-frame wavelengths:\n        $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b / \\lambda_{rest,1}}{b / \\lambda_{rest,2}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} $\n    *   Now, we use the Doppler effect and the fact that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n        *   For Star_1 ($v_{r,1} = 0$):  $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}(1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{rest,1}$\n        *   For Star_2 ($v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   We can now find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths needed for our temperature ratio:\n        $ \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c} $\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c} $\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Result:**\nNow substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\times (\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c})^4 $\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c = 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$ (speed of light)\n\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{700,000}{299,792,458}})^4 $\n\nThe calculation gives:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times (0.99766)^{-4} \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.99071 \\approx 2.2291 $\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe provided code output `2.22908325509156` confirms the calculation performed in the previous steps.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  The ratio of luminosities is given by $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\times (T_1 / T_2)^4$.\n2.  Given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, the radius term is $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n3.  The observed peak wavelengths are the same. However, Star 2 is moving away, so its light is redshifted. This means its rest-frame peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest,2}$) must be shorter than Star 1's rest-frame peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest,1}$) for them to appear the same to us.\n4.  From Wien's Law ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$), a shorter rest wavelength implies a higher temperature. Therefore, $T_2 > T_1$.\n5.  The precise relationship derived from the Doppler shift formula is $(T_1 / T_2)^4 = ((1 - \\beta) / (1 + \\beta))^2$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n6.

The observed peak wavelength (λ_obs) is affected by the Doppler shift from the star's radial velocity (vᵣ).\n    *   λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + vᵣ/c)\n    *   We are given λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂.\n    *   For Star 1, vᵣ₁ = 0, so λ_emit₁ = λ_obs₁.\n    *   For Star 2, vᵣ₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs₂ = λ_emit₂ * (1 + vᵣ₂/c).\n    *   Combining these gives: λ_emit₁ = λ_emit₂ * (1 + vᵣ₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emit₂/λ_emit₁ = 1 / (1 + vᵣ₂/c).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 700/c)]⁴\n\nThe code execution result, `2.2291219306589554`, is consistent with the previous calculations.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe reasoning process remains the same, as the slight variation in the code output does not alter the underlying physics or the final conclusion. The difference in the output is due to a minor difference in the value of the speed of light (`c`) used in the calculation, but both results round to the same answer.\n\n**Recap of the Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Goal:** Determine the luminosity ratio $L_1 / L_2$.\n2.  **Luminosity Formula (Stefan-Boltzmann Law):** The luminosity $L$ of a star is given by $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem gives $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$.\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (Wien's Law & Doppler Effect):**\n    *   Wien's Law states that a star's temperature $T$ is inversely proportional to its rest-frame peak emission wavelength, $\\lambda_{max, rest}$. Thus, $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{max, rest, 2} / \\lambda_{max, rest, 1}$.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n    *   We use the Doppler effect to relate observed and rest wavelengths: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$.\n    *   For Star_1 ($v_{r1}=0$): $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, rest, 1}$.\n    *   For Star_2 ($v_{r2}=700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, rest, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{max, rest, 1} = \\lambda_{max, rest, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   This gives the required ratio for the temperatures: $\\frac{\\lambda_{max, rest, 2}}{\\lambda_{max, rest, 1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$.\n    *   So, $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** We substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}\\right)^4 $$\n    Plugging in the values ($v_{r2} = 7 \\times 10^5$ m/s and $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s), the calculation gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.229 $$\n    This result is closest to option B. The minor variations in the provided code outputs (2.229107... and 2.229121...) are due to using slightly different values for the speed of light but both confirm that the correct answer is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Relation**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Information**: We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂) = 1.5. Substituting this into the equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Temperature Relation**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law. This law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength at which it emits light (λ_emitted):\n    T = b / λ_emitted\n    where b is Wien's constant.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁/T₂ = (b / λ_emitted,₁) / (b / λ_emitted,₂) = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n\n5.  **Doppler Shift**: The observed peak wavelength (λ_obs) is affected by the star's radial velocity (v_r) due to the Doppler effect. The relationship between the emitted and observed wavelength is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Relating Temperatures to Observations**:\n    *   For Star_1: v_r1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s.

Let's break down how this result was obtained.\n\n**Reasoning Breakdown**\n\n1.  **Luminosity and the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is determined by its surface area (A) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = σ * A * T⁴\n    Since a star is a sphere, its surface area is A = 4πR², where R is the radius. So the full formula is:\n    L = σ * 4πR² * T⁴\n\n2.  **Forming the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of Star 1's luminosity to Star 2's luminosity (L₁ / L₂).\n    L₁ / L₂ = (σ * 4πR₁² * T₁⁴) / (σ * 4πR₂² * T₂⁴)\n    The constants (σ, 4, π) cancel out, leaving a simpler relationship:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio (R₁/R₂):** The problem explicitly states that Star 1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star 2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    *   Therefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    *   (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):** This is the more complex part.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a star's true surface temperature (T) to the *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emit) at which it shines brightest: λ_emit = b / T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means T = b / λ_emit.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The star's motion affects the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   **Combining the Laws:** The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n        *   For Star 1 (v₁ = 0): λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emit,1.\n        *   For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n        *   Setting them equal: λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n    *   **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** Now we substitute λ_emit = b/T back into this equation:\n        *   b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + 700/c)\n        *   1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + 700/c)\n        *   Rearranging to solve for T₁/T₂ gives: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we plug everything back into our luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1 / (1 + 700/c))⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + 700 / 299792.458))⁴\n\nThe python code executed this final calculation, which yielded:\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.23\n\nThe information about the stars' masses was extra information not needed to solve the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe code executed successfully, yielding a result of approximately 2.2291.\n\nHere's a summary of the reasoning:\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** The ratio of luminosities is given by $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature is determined by Wien's law ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{max, emitted}}$). The *observed* peak wavelengths are the same. However, Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its emitted light is Doppler-shifted (redshifted) to a longer wavelength before we observe it.\n    *   For Star_1 (at rest), $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 1}}$.\n    *   For Star_2 (receding), $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, 2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 2}} \\cdot (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs, 2}}$, we have $\\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 2}} \\cdot (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   This means the temperature ratio is $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 2}} / \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 1}} = 1 / (1 + v_2/c)$.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Plugging everything in:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot [1 / (1 + v_2/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + 700000 / 299792458)^4$.\n\nThe python code calculated this value to be ~2.2291.

Therefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n    So, our luminosity ratio equation becomes:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body to its temperature:\n    λ_max = b / T  (where b is Wien's constant)\n    This means T = b / λ_max. The temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength *emitted* by the star (the rest wavelength, λ_rest).\n    So, T₁/T₂ = (b / λ_rest₁) / (b / λ_rest₂) = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁.\n\n5.  **Relating Observed and Rest Wavelengths**: The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). We must account for the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities (v_r). The relationship is:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c)\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Calculating Rest Wavelengths**:\n    *   For Star_1: v_r₁ = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift, so λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star_2: v_r₂ = 700 km/s. The light is redshifted, so λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v_r₂ / c).\n\n7.  **Finding the Temperature Ratio (continued)**:\n    Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have:\n    λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n    Now we rearrange to get the ratio needed for our temperature calculation:\n    λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n    Since T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁, we have:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute this temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [ 1 / (1 + v_r₂ / c) ]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r₂ / c)⁴\n\n    Now, we plug in the values:\n    *   v_r₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c ≈ 299,792 km/s (speed of light)\n    \n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 299792)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002335)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009367\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229, which rounds to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe provided code output `2.22908325509156` is the result of the calculation performed to solve the problem.\n\n**Summary of the Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio Formula:** The ratio of luminosities is given by $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n2.  **Radius and Area:** Given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$, the area ratio $(R_1/R_2)^2$ is $1.5^2 = 2.25$.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$ depends on the Doppler shift of Star 2, since the observed peak wavelengths are the same.

Let's analyze this result and the reasoning process.\n\n### Reasoning and Confirmation\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio Formula:** The core of the problem lies in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which gives the luminosity (L) of a black body as `L = 4πR²σT⁴`. The ratio of luminosities for Star 1 and Star 2 is:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`\n\n2.  **Radius Factor:** The problem states `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so `R1/R2 = 1.5`. The radius factor in the luminosity ratio is:\n    `(R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`.\n\n3.  **Temperature Factor:**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation (`λ_em`): `T ∝ 1/λ_em`. Therefore, `T1/T2 = λ_em2 / λ_em1`.\n    *   The astronomers observed the *same* peak wavelength (`λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`). However, the temperature is determined by the wavelength *emitted* by the star in its own reference frame, not the one we observe, which can be affected by the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star 1, with zero radial velocity (`v1 = 0`), the observed and emitted wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs1 = λ_em1`.\n    *   For Star 2, which is moving away at `v2 = 700 km/s`, its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength. The relationship is given by the relativistic Doppler shift formula: `λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * √[(1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)]`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`, we have `λ_em1 = λ_em2 * √[(1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)]`.\n    *   We can now find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation: `λ_em2 / λ_em1 = 1 / √[(1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)] = √[(1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c)]`.\n    *   So, `T1/T2 = √[(1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c)]`.\n    *   The temperature factor in the luminosity ratio is the fourth power of this: `(T1/T2)⁴ = ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))²`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Combining the factors: `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))²`.\n    *   The term `(1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c)` is less than 1 because `v2` is positive. Squaring it results in a number that is still less than 1.\n    *   Therefore, the final luminosity ratio `L1/L2` must be slightly less than 2.25.\n    *   Looking at the options:\n        *   A) ~2.23 (Less than 2.25)\n        *   B) ~2.25 (Equal to 2.25, which would imply T1=T2)\n        *   C) ~2.32 (Greater than 2.25)\n        *   D) ~2.35 (Greater than 2.25)\n    *   Logically, only option A can be correct. The code execution confirms this by yielding `2.229083...`, which rounds to **2.23**.\n\nThe extraneous information about the mass of the stars is not needed for solving this specific problem based on black body radiation laws.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (`L1`) to the luminosity of Star_2 (`L2`), which is `L1 / L2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body radiator, is given by the formula `L = 4πR²σT⁴`, where `R` is the star's radius, `T` is its absolute surface temperature, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars, we can set up the ratio:\n    `L1 / L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴)`\n    The constants `4π` and `σ` cancel out, leaving:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`\n\n4.  **Determine the Ratio of Radii (R1/R2):** The problem explicitly states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.\n    `R1 = 1.5 * R2`\n    Therefore, the ratio `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Ratio of Temperatures (T1/T2):**\n    *   **Recall Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a black body's temperature to its peak emission wavelength (`λ_max`) in its rest frame: `T = b / λ_max_rest`, where `b` is Wien's constant. This means `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_max_rest`.\n    *   So, the temperature ratio `T1 / T2` is equal to the inverse ratio of their rest-frame peak wavelengths: `T1 / T2 = λ_max_rest2 / λ_max_rest1`.\n    *   **Incorporate the Doppler Effect:** The astronomers measured the *observed* peak wavelengths (`λ_obs`), which are affected by the stars' radial velocities. The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the relativistic Doppler shift formula: `λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`, where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   **Apply to each star:**\n        *   For Star_1: `v1 = 0 km/s`. So, `λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * sqrt((1+0)/(1-0)) = λ_rest1`.\n        *   For Star_2: `v2 = 700 km/s`. So, `λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`.\n    *   **Use the given information:** The problem states the observed peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`.\n    *   Therefore, `λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`.\n    *   Rearrange this equation to find the ratio of rest wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n        `λ_max_rest2 / λ_max_rest1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`.\n    *   Now, substitute this back into the temperature ratio:\n        `T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the main luminosity ratio equation:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`\n    `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))]⁴`\n    The square root and the power of 4 simplify, as `(sqrt(x))⁴ = x²`:\n    `L1 / L2 = (2.25) * [(1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c)]²`\n\n7.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** Plug in the known values:\n    *   `v2 = 700 km/s`\n    *   `c` (speed of light) `≈ 299792.458 km/s`\n    The calculation was performed using the provided Python interpreter:\n    ```python\n    # Speed of light in km/s\n    c = 299792.458\n    # Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\n    v2 = 700.0\n    # Ratio of radii, R1/R2\n    R_ratio = 1.5\n\n    # The formula for the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * ((T1/T2)^4)\n    # We found that (T1/T2)^4 = ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))^2\n    beta = v2 / c\n    luminosity_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\n    print(luminosity_ratio)\n    ```\n    The output of the code is `2.22908325509156`.\n\n8.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value `2.22908...` is approximately `2.23`. This matches option D. The information about the stars' masses was extra information not needed for the final calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nAn analysis of the problem has already been performed. The key steps are:\n1.  Use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to express the ratio of luminosities: $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n2.  Use the given information that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2)^2 = 2.25$.\n3.  Determine the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$ by combining Wien's Displacement Law ($\\lambda_{max,rest} \\propto 1/T$) with the Doppler shift formula ($\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1+v_r/c)$).\n4.  Given that the observed peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$), and that Star 1 has zero radial velocity while Star 2 has $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, we derive the relationship between the true temperatures: $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n5.  Substituting the values into the luminosity ratio equation gives: $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + (700 \\times 10^3) / c)^4$.\n\nThe previous execution of the Python code yielded a result of approximately 2.229.

I will now explain the result and provide the final answer.\n\n### Final Reasoning\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to compute the ratio of luminosities, $L_1/L_2$.\n2.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity $L$ of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $R$ is the radius and $T$ is the surface temperature.\n3.  **Luminosity Ratio:** The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n4.  **Given Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n5.  **Temperature Ratio (Wien's Law & Doppler Effect):**\n    *   According to Wien's Displacement Law, the temperature $T$ is inversely proportional to the *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$), so $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}}$.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   We must relate the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength using the Doppler effect formula: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star 1, $v_{r,1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2, $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s}$, so $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging gives the ratio of emitted wavelengths: $\\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}\\right)^4$\n7.  **Numerical Value:** Using the given values:\n    *   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    The calculation was performed by the Python script:\n    `luminosity_ratio = (1.5**2) / (1 + (700000 / 299792458))**4`\n    The code output provided was `2.229107561148499`.\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 2.23. This matches option C. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThe calculation shows the luminosity ratio is approximately `2.2291`.\n\nLooking at the provided options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value `2.2291` is closest to `2.23`.\n\nThe step-by-step reasoning is as follows:\n1.  The luminosity `L` is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `L = 4πR²σT⁴`.\n2.  The ratio of luminosities is `L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`.\n3.  Given `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`, the radius term `(R₁/R₂)²` is `1.5² = 2.25`.\n4.  The observed peak wavelength `λ_obs` is related to the emitted wavelength `λ_em` by the Doppler effect: `λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v/c)`.\n5.  The emitted wavelength is related to temperature by Wien's Law: `λ_em = b/T`.\n6.  For Star 1, `v₁=0`, so `λ_obs,₁ = λ_em,₁ = b/T₁`.\n7.  For Star 2, `v₂=700 km/s`, so `λ_obs,₂ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c) = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n8.  The problem states `λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂`. Therefore, `b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n9.  This simplifies to the temperature ratio `T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n10. Substituting this back into the luminosity ratio gives: `L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴`.\n11. Plugging in the values `v₂ = 700 km/s` and `c ≈ 299792.458 km/s` yields the result `~2.2291`, which rounds to `2.23`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThe code execution returned the value `2.22908326`.\n\nThis result confirms the reasoning:\n\n1.  The luminosity ratio is given by the formula L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴.\n2.  We were given R1/R2 = 1.5.\n3.  We derived the temperature ratio (T1/T2) based on the Doppler shift affecting the observed peak wavelength of Star_2, leading to (T1/T2)⁴ = ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))².\n4.  Plugging in the values: v2 = 700,000 m/s and c = 299,792,458 m/s, the code calculated the final ratio.\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to the option C) ~2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2.\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: The luminosity (L) of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.

Formulate the Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Write the luminosity ratio.**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4) = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n*   **Step 2: Relate temperatures to peak wavelengths.**\n    Using Wien's Law, we know that temperature is inversely proportional to the *rest-frame* peak wavelength ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max}}$).

Because Star 2 is moving away, its light is redshifted to a longer wavelength. For it to be *observed* at the same peak wavelength as the stationary Star 1, its *actual* peak emission must be at a shorter wavelength, implying a higher temperature.\n\n*   **Step 6: Calculate the final luminosity ratio.**\n    Substitute all the known ratios into the formula from Step 1:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}\\right)^4$\n    $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 \\times (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^{-4}$\n\n**5.

Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) at which it radiates, as measured in its own rest frame:\n$T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{rest}}$, where b is Wien's constant.\nThis means that the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of their rest-frame peak wavelengths:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. We must account for the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities. The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by:\n$\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_r}{c}\\right)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star 1: $v_{r1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\nFor Star 2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)$.\n\nSince $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n$\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)$\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:\n$\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}$\n\nSince $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$, the temperature ratio is:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}$\n\nFinally, we can substitute all the parts back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (2.25) \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)^4}$\n\nThe python code executed this calculation:\n$v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n$c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{299792.458}\\right)^4} \\approx 2.2291$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the result is 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to Star_2 (L₂).\n\n**1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law**\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\nwhere:\n*   R is the radius of the star.\n*   T is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n*   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n**2. Luminosity Ratio**\nTo find the ratio L₁/L₂, we can set up the equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**3. Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of the radii is:\nR₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\nSubstituting this into our equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**4. Temperature Ratio**\nTo find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law and the Doppler effect.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law** states that the emitted wavelength at which a black body's radiation is maximum (λ_emitted) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T): λ_emitted ∝ 1/T.\n*   The **Doppler effect** relates the observed wavelength (λ_observed) to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) based on the object's radial velocity (v_r). For non-relativistic speeds, λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), where c is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars:\nλ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2\n\nLet's write out the expressions for each star:\n*   For Star_1: v_r1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift.\n    λ_observed,1 = λ_emitted,1\n*   For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. The light is redshifted.\n    λ_observed,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\nSince the observed wavelengths are equal:\nλ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\nNow, we can substitute T using Wien's law (λ_emitted = b/T, where 'b' is a constant):\nb / T₁ = (b / T₂) * (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\nThe constant 'b' cancels out. We can rearrange the equation to find the temperature ratio T₁/T₂:\n1 / T₁ = (1 / T₂) * (1 + v_r2 / c)\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 + v_r2 / c\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\n**5.

The value `2.2291...` is not an error; it is the calculated result based on the laws of physics. Let's walk through how this number gives us the correct choice.\n\n### **Analysis of the Result**\n\n1.  **Physics Derivation:** The luminosity ratio is correctly determined by the formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Known Values:**\n    *   The radius ratio squared, (R₁/R₂)², is (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n    *   The temperature ratio, T₁/T₂, is determined by the Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength of Star 2. This leads to the relationship T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n3.  **Final Formula:** Combining these gives the expression used in the code:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴**\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The code correctly calculates the value of this expression using v₂ = 700 km/s and c = 299792.458 km/s.\n    *   The result is **2.229107561148499**.\n\n5.  **Matching with Options:** The question asks for an approximate factor from the following choices:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.25\n\n    When we round our calculated result, `2.2291...`, to two decimal places, we get **2.23**.\n\nTherefore, the code output is not an error; it is the correct calculation that confirms **Option C** is the right answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe user has requested the solution to the astronomy problem again. My previous reasoning stands correct and is re-summarized here.\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship for luminosity:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`\n    where `R` is the radius, `T` is the surface temperature, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Formulate the ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 (`L₁ / L₂`).\n    `L₁ / L₂ = (4 * π * R₁² * σ * T₁⁴) / (4 * π * R₂² * σ * T₂⁴)`\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    `L₁ / L₂ = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴`\n\n3.  **Incorporate the given information about the radii:** The problem states `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`. Therefore, the radius ratio is `R₁ / R₂ = 1.5`.\n    Squaring this gives: `(R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`.\n\n4.  **Determine the temperature ratio (`T₁ / T₂`):**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation (`λ_emitted`): `T = b / λ_emitted`, where `b` is a constant. This means `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_emitted`.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is `T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_observed_1 = λ_observed_2`). However, Star 2 is moving, so its emitted wavelength is Doppler-shifted.\n    *   The Doppler shift formula for light is `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)`, where `v_r` is the radial velocity (positive for moving away) and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star 1, `v₁ = 0`, so `λ_observed_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   For Star 2, `v₂ = 700 km/s`, so `λ_observed_2 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v₂ / c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_observed_1 = λ_observed_2`, we have: `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v₂ / c)`.\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio we need for temperature: `λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / (1 + v₂ / c)`.\n    *   Thus, the temperature ratio is `T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂ / c)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and calculate the final luminosity ratio:**\n    Substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    `L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (1 / (1 + v₂ / c))⁴`\n    `L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂ / c)⁴`\n\n6.  **Perform the numerical calculation:** Using the values `v₂ = 700 km/s` and `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.

So, $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n\n5.  **Relate Temperature to Wavelength:** According to Wien's Displacement Law, the intrinsic surface temperature ($T$) of a black body is related to its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max, emit}$):\n    $\\lambda_{max, emit} = \\frac{b}{T}$\n    where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Effect:** The radial velocity of a star causes a Doppler shift, changing the wavelength of light we observe.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Conventionally, a positive radial velocity indicates the star is moving away from us (recession), which causes a redshift (observed wavelength is longer). The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$\n        Therefore, $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):** We can now find the relationship between the temperatures of the two stars.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{max, emit, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    *   Now, substitute Wien's Law ($ \\lambda_{max, emit} = b/T $):\n        $\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    *   Solving for the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula from step 3:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}\\right)^4$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^2$\n\n9.  **Perform the Calculation:** We use the given values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and the speed of light $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s.\n\n    The ratio $v_2/c$ is:\n    $v_2/c = 700 / 299792.458 \\approx 0.00233496$\n\n    Now, substitute this value into the expression for the luminosity ratio:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1 - 0.00233496}{1 + 0.00233496}\\right)^2$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{0.99766504}{1.00233496}\\right)^2$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (0.9953406)^2$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times 0.9907034$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.22908$\n\n10. **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of ~2.23 is closest to option A.\n\n    If we had assumed astronomers corrected for the Doppler shift and that the *emitted* peak wavelengths were the same, then $T_1$ would equal $T_2$, and the ratio would be exactly $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$. However, the wording \"appeared brightest\" and the explicit inclusion of the radial velocity values suggest that the Doppler shift must be accounted for.

    "Here is a detailed reasoning analysis of the provided answers to determine the most consistent and correct solution.\n\n### **Detailed Reasoning Analysis**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the luminosity ratio $L_1/L_2$ between two stars.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Physics:** The luminosity of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is a constant. The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem explicitly states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Plugging this in gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part of the derivation, and nearly all candidate answers derive it correctly.\n    *   According to Wien's Displacement Law, a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$): $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$. This means the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. This observation must be connected to the intrinsic wavelength using the Doppler effect formula.\n    *   For Star_1 ($v_1 = 0$), there is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2 ($v_2 = 700$ km/s), the observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted (redshifted) because it's moving away from the observer: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$), we can equate the expressions:\n        $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Substituting the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 $$\n    Plugging in the values ($v_2 = 700,000$ m/s and $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s), the calculation gives a result of approximately **2.229**.\n\n### **Consistency of Candidate Answers**\n\n*   **Reasoning Consistency:** An overwhelming majority of the provided answers (at least 40 out of 45) correctly follow the logical steps outlined above. Some use the non-relativistic Doppler formula, while others use the slightly more accurate relativistic formula, but as shown in the reasoning, the final numerical result is negligibly different. The physical reasoning is highly consistent.\n*   **Numerical Consistency:** Nearly every answer that performs the calculation correctly arrives at the numerical value of **~2.229**. This demonstrates strong numerical consistency.\n*   **Final Choice Inconsistency:** The most significant inconsistency across the answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is because the options appear to have been randomized for each problem-solving attempt. However, the consistent element is that the reasoning always leads to the numerical value of `~2.23`.

We are given that $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n3.  The temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$ must be determined from the information about the peak wavelengths.\n4.  According to Wien's Displacement Law, a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its intrinsic peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), so $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n5.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars.\n6.  The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler effect formula: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v/c)$.\n7.  For Star 1, $v_1 = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n8.  For Star 2, $v_2 = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n9.  Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n10. This gives the ratio $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n11. Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n12. Substituting the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity formula gives:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\times (\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c})^4$.\n13. The Python code calculated this value using $v_2 = 700,000$ m/s and the precise value for the speed of light $c$.\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.229. When rounded to two decimal places, this is 2.23. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2, which can be written as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Laws:**\n*   **Luminosity of a Black Body (Stefan-Boltzmann Law):** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is determined by its surface area (A) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is $L = A \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since a star is a sphere, its surface area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$, where R is the radius. So, the full formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Peak Wavelength of a Black Body (Wien's Displacement Law):** The temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which its emission is strongest ($\\lambda_{rest,max}$). The formula is $T = b / \\lambda_{rest,max}$, where 'b' is Wien's constant and $\\lambda_{rest,max}$ is the peak wavelength in the star's own rest frame.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. This is described by the Doppler effect. The relativistic Doppler formula for an object moving away is: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$, where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\nWe can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} $\nThe constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**4. Incorporate the Radius Information:**\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the ratio $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$. Substituting this into our equation:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n*   From Wien's Law, we know that $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest,max}$. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{rest,max,2} / \\lambda_{rest,max,1}$.\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$). We must relate these observed wavelengths to the rest-frame wavelengths using the Doppler effect.\n*   For Star_1, the radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$. This means there is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,max,1}$.\n*   For Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted (redshifted) because it's moving away:\n    $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,max,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n*   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can equate the expressions:\n    $\\lambda_{rest,max,1} = \\lambda_{rest,max,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n*   Now, we can find the ratio of rest-frame wavelengths:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,max,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,max,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n*   This ratio is equal to our temperature ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n**6. Complete the Luminosity Calculation:**\nNow we substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}} \\right)^4 \\right) $\nThis simplifies to:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c} \\right)^2 $\n\n**7. Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\nThe code output confirms the numerical result of this final expression.\n*   $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$\n*   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nThe calculation from the provided code output is `2.2290976580640076`.\n\n**8.

We are given that $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n4.  Wien's Displacement Law states that the temperature of a star is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation ($\\lambda_{emitted, max}$): $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted, max}$. Therefore, $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} / \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1}$.\n5.  The observed peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs, max}$) is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$): $\\lambda_{obs, max} = \\lambda_{emitted, max} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n6.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{obs, max, 2}$.\n7.  For Star 1, $v_{r1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1}$.\n8.  For Star 2, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{obs, max, 2} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n9.  Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{emitted, max, 1} = \\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n10. Rearranging this to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation: $\\lambda_{emitted, max, 2} / \\lambda_{emitted, max, 1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n11. Therefore, the temperature ratio is $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n12. Substituting this back into the luminosity ratio equation: $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 \\cdot (1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c))^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$.\n13. The Python code calculated this value using $v_{r2} = 700,000$ m/s and $c = 299,792,458$ m/s.\n14. The result is `2.2291...`, which rounds to `2.23`. This matches option A. The information about the mass is irrelevant to this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe user has provided a code output that is very slightly different from the one I generated. This discrepancy is due to using a different value for the speed of light, `c`. The provided output `2.2291075611` is obtained when using the common approximation `c = 3e8 m/s`, while my original calculation used the more precise value `c = 299792458 m/s`.\n\nLet's re-verify the steps and the conclusion.\n\n### Reasoning Breakdown\n\n1.  **Objective:** Calculate the ratio of luminosities, $L_1 / L_2$.\n2.  **Governing Law:** The Stefan-Boltzmann law for a black body states that luminosity ($L$) is proportional to the square of its radius ($R$) and the fourth power of its surface temperature ($T$).\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n3.  **Luminosity Ratio Formula:** The ratio of luminosities is therefore:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\times (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n4.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $(R_1 / R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n5.  **Temperature Ratio:** To find the temperature ratio, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation ($\\lambda_{max,rest}$) in its own rest frame:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{max,rest}$ (where $b$ is Wien's constant).\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of their rest-frame peak wavelengths:\n    $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{max,rest,2} / \\lambda_{max,rest,1}$\n6.  **Doppler Shift:** The problem gives us information about the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,obs}$) and the stars' radial velocities ($v_r$). The observed wavelength is related to the rest-frame wavelength by the Doppler effect:\n    $\\lambda_{rest} = \\lambda_{obs} / (1 + v_r/c)$\n    (A positive velocity indicates movement away from the observer, causing a redshift).\n7.  **Calculating Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   For Star_1, $v_{r,1} = 0$, so its rest-frame wavelength is equal to its observed wavelength: $\\lambda_{max,rest,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. Its rest-frame wavelength is $\\lambda_{max,rest,2} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2} / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Since the problem states that their *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$), we can substitute these into the temperature ratio equation:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = [\\lambda_{max,obs,2} / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)] / \\lambda_{max,obs,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now we combine the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + (700 \\text{ km/s})/c)^4$\n\nThe provided code output `2.2291075611` correctly calculates this value using `c = 3e8 m/s`.\nRounding this result to two decimal places gives 2.23.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reasoning for this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 ($L_1/L_2$):\n    $L_1/L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$, so the ratio of their radii is $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Therefore, $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law and Temperature:** The temperature of a star is related to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation ($\\lambda_{em}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{em}$\n    where b is Wien's constant. This means the temperature is inversely proportional to the peak emitted wavelength, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{em}$.\n    The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{em,2} / \\lambda_{em,1}$\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. However, the temperature depends on the *emitted* wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$), which can be different from the observed one due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). The relationship is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Finding the Emitted Wavelength Ratio:**\n    *   For Star 1: $v_{r1} = 0$, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Since the problem states that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can equate the two expressions:\n        $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Rearranging this gives us the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\lambda_{em,2} / \\lambda_{em,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Since $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{em,2} / \\lambda_{em,1}$, we have:\n    $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    Using the given values:\n    *   $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n    *   $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s\n    The calculation was performed by the Python script, yielding a result of approximately 2.2291.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio $L_1/L_2 \\approx 2.2291$. Comparing this value to the given options:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.25\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.35\n    The result is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reasoning for solving this problem involves combining the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black body radiation with the relativistic Doppler effect.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a spherical black body, is given by the formula:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star\\_1 and Star\\_2, which is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n3.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the *emitted* wavelength at which its radiation is most intense ($\\lambda_{em}$):\n    $\\lambda_{em} = \\frac{b}{T}$ or $T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{em}}$\n    where b is Wien's constant. From this, we can write the temperature ratio as:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}}$\n\n4.  **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. However, Star\\_2 is moving away from us at a high velocity, so its light is redshifted. The relationship between the observed and emitted wavelength is given by the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$\n    where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Connecting the Equations:**\n    *   For Star\\_1, the radial velocity $v_1 = 0$, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   For Star\\_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$.\n    *   We are given that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$. Therefore:\n        $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n    *   This ratio is equal to the temperature ratio:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** We can now substitute the known values and derived ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    *   Radius ratio: $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n    *   Luminosity ratio: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}\\right)^4$\n    *   This simplifies to:\n        $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^2$\n\nUsing the provided code output, which calculates this exact expression:\nThe calculated value for the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.

Therefore, $(R_1 / R_2)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25$.\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the temperatures, $T_1 / T_2$. The temperature is related to the peak wavelength of the star's emission by Wien's displacement law:\n$T = b / \\lambda_{peak, em}$\nwhere b is Wien's constant and $\\lambda_{peak, em}$ is the peak wavelength emitted in the star's rest frame.\n\nThe observed peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{peak, obs}$) is affected by the star's radial velocity (v) due to the Doppler effect:\n$\\lambda_{peak, obs} = \\lambda_{peak, em} * (1 + v/c)$\nwhere c is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star_1, the radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its emitted peak wavelength:\n$\\lambda_{peak, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{peak, em, 1}$\n\nFor Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is:\n$\\lambda_{peak, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{peak, em, 2} * (1 + v_2/c)$\n\nThe problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars:\n$\\lambda_{peak, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{peak, obs, 2}$\n\nTherefore:\n$\\lambda_{peak, em, 1} = \\lambda_{peak, em, 2} * (1 + v_2/c)$\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n$T_1 / T_2 = (b / \\lambda_{peak, em, 1}) / (b / \\lambda_{peak, em, 2}) = \\lambda_{peak, em, 2} / \\lambda_{peak, em, 1}$\n\nSubstituting the relationship we found for the emitted wavelengths:\n$T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{peak, em, 2} / (\\lambda_{peak, em, 2} * (1 + v_2/c)) = 1 / (1 + v_2/c)$\n\nNow we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v_2/c))^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_2/c)^4$\n\nUsing the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c = 299792.458$ km/s, the calculation yields:\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 299792.458)^4 \\approx 2.25 / (1.002335)^4 \\approx 2.25 / 1.00938 \\approx 2.229$\n\nThe code output confirms this result is approximately 2.229.

Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_1 / L_2$).\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles:**\n*   **Luminosity and the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** For a star that radiates as a perfect black body, its total luminosity ($L$) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4 = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $R$ is the star's radius, $T$ is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Peak Wavelength and Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature ($T$) of a star is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{rest}$). This is described by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{rest}$\n    where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant and $\\lambda_{rest}$ is the wavelength emitted by the star in its own reference frame (i.e., not affected by its motion relative to us).\n\n*   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The wavelength we observe ($\\lambda_{obs}$) from a moving star is shifted from its emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to the Doppler effect. For speeds much less than the speed of light ($c$), the relationship is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r / c)$\n    where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if moving toward).\n\n**3.

Determine the Known Ratios from the Problem Statement:**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}) = 1.5$.\n    This means $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25$.\n    *Note: The mass information is not required for this calculation and can be ignored.*\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We must use the information about the peak wavelengths.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is related to the rest-frame wavelengths:\n        $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b / \\lambda_{rest,1}}{b / \\lambda_{rest,2}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} $\n    *   Now, we use the Doppler effect and the fact that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n        *   For Star_1 ($v_{r,1} = 0$):  $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}(1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{rest,1}$\n        *   For Star_2 ($v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   We can now find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths needed for our temperature ratio:\n        $ \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c} $\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c} $\n\n**5.

The ratio of luminosities is given by $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\times (T_1 / T_2)^4$.\n2.  Given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, the radius term is $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n3.  The observed peak wavelengths are the same. However, Star 2 is moving away, so its light is redshifted. This means its rest-frame peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest,2}$) must be shorter than Star 1's rest-frame peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest,1}$) for them to appear the same to us.\n4.  From Wien's Law ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$), a shorter rest wavelength implies a higher temperature. Therefore, $T_2 > T_1$.\n5.  The precise relationship derived from the Doppler shift formula is $(T_1 / T_2)^4 = ((1 - \\beta) / (1 + \\beta))^2$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n6.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe reasoning process remains the same, as the slight variation in the code output does not alter the underlying physics or the final conclusion. The difference in the output is due to a minor difference in the value of the speed of light (`c`) used in the calculation, but both results round to the same answer.\n\n**Recap of the Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Goal:** Determine the luminosity ratio $L_1 / L_2$.\n2.  **Luminosity Formula (Stefan-Boltzmann Law):** The luminosity $L$ of a star is given by $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem gives $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$.\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (Wien's Law & Doppler Effect):**\n    *   Wien's Law states that a star's temperature $T$ is inversely proportional to its rest-frame peak emission wavelength, $\\lambda_{max, rest}$. Thus, $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{max, rest, 2} / \\lambda_{max, rest, 1}$.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n    *   We use the Doppler effect to relate observed and rest wavelengths: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$.\n    *   For Star_1 ($v_{r1}=0$): $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, rest, 1}$.\n    *   For Star_2 ($v_{r2}=700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, rest, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{max, rest, 1} = \\lambda_{max, rest, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   This gives the required ratio for the temperatures: $\\frac{\\lambda_{max, rest, 2}}{\\lambda_{max, rest, 1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$.\n    *   So, $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** We substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}\\right)^4 $$\n    Plugging in the values ($v_{r2} = 7 \\times 10^5$ m/s and $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s), the calculation gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.229 $$\n    This result is closest to option B. The minor variations in the provided code outputs (2.229107... and 2.229121...) are due to using slightly different values for the speed of light but both confirm that the correct answer is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Relation**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Information**: We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂) = 1.5. Substituting this into the equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Temperature Relation**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law. This law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength at which it emits light (λ_emitted):\n    T = b / λ_emitted\n    where b is Wien's constant.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁/T₂ = (b / λ_emitted,₁) / (b / λ_emitted,₂) = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n\n5.  **Doppler Shift**: The observed peak wavelength (λ_obs) is affected by the star's radial velocity (v_r) due to the Doppler effect. The relationship between the emitted and observed wavelength is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Relating Temperatures to Observations**:\n    *   For Star_1: v_r1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. It is moving away, so its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r2 / c).\n    *   We are told that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   Therefore: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r2 / c).\n\n7.  **Calculating Temperature Ratio**: Now we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n    Since T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁, we have:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute this temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v_r2 / c))⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r2 / c)⁴\n\n    Using the values:\n    *   v_r2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n    *   The calculation `2.25 / (1 + 700000 / 299792458)⁴` was performed by the code.\n\n9.  **Result**: The code output `2.2291...` is the numerical result of this calculation.

Let's break down how this result was obtained.\n\n**Reasoning Breakdown**\n\n1.  **Luminosity and the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is determined by its surface area (A) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = σ * A * T⁴\n    Since a star is a sphere, its surface area is A = 4πR², where R is the radius. So the full formula is:\n    L = σ * 4πR² * T⁴\n\n2.  **Forming the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of Star 1's luminosity to Star 2's luminosity (L₁ / L₂).\n    L₁ / L₂ = (σ * 4πR₁² * T₁⁴) / (σ * 4πR₂² * T₂⁴)\n    The constants (σ, 4, π) cancel out, leaving a simpler relationship:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio (R₁/R₂):** The problem explicitly states that Star 1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star 2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    *   Therefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    *   (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):** This is the more complex part.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a star's true surface temperature (T) to the *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emit) at which it shines brightest: λ_emit = b / T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means T = b / λ_emit.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The star's motion affects the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   **Combining the Laws:** The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n        *   For Star 1 (v₁ = 0): λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emit,1.\n        *   For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n        *   Setting them equal: λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n    *   **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** Now we substitute λ_emit = b/T back into this equation:\n        *   b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + 700/c)\n        *   1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + 700/c)\n        *   Rearranging to solve for T₁/T₂ gives: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we plug everything back into our luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1 / (1 + 700/c))⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + 700 / 299792.458))⁴\n\nThe python code executed this final calculation, which yielded:\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.23\n\nThe information about the stars' masses was extra information not needed to solve the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe code executed successfully, yielding a result of approximately 2.2291.\n\nHere's a summary of the reasoning:\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** The ratio of luminosities is given by $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature is determined by Wien's law ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{max, emitted}}$). The *observed* peak wavelengths are the same. However, Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its emitted light is Doppler-shifted (redshifted) to a longer wavelength before we observe it.\n    *   For Star_1 (at rest), $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 1}}$.\n    *   For Star_2 (receding), $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, 2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 2}} \\cdot (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs, 2}}$, we have $\\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 2}} \\cdot (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   This means the temperature ratio is $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 2}} / \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 1}} = 1 / (1 + v_2/c)$.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Plugging everything in:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot [1 / (1 + v_2/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + 700000 / 299792458)^4$.\n\nThe python code calculated this value to be ~2.2291. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value of 2.2291 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Formula**: The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (L₁/L₂).\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n    So, our luminosity ratio equation becomes:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body to its temperature:\n    λ_max = b / T  (where b is Wien's constant)\n    This means T = b / λ_max. The temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength *emitted* by the star (the rest wavelength, λ_rest).\n    So, T₁/T₂ = (b / λ_rest₁) / (b / λ_rest₂) = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁.\n\n5.  **Relating Observed and Rest Wavelengths**: The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). We must account for the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities (v_r). The relationship is:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c)\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Calculating Rest Wavelengths**:\n    *   For Star_1: v_r₁ = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift, so λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star_2: v_r₂ = 700 km/s. The light is redshifted, so λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v_r₂ / c).\n\n7.  **Finding the Temperature Ratio (continued)**:\n    Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have:\n    λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n    Now we rearrange to get the ratio needed for our temperature calculation:\n    λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n    Since T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁, we have:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute this temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [ 1 / (1 + v_r₂ / c) ]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r₂ / c)⁴\n\n    Now, we plug in the values:\n    *   v_r₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c ≈ 299,792 km/s (speed of light)\n    \n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 299792)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002335)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009367\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229, which rounds to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe provided code output `2.22908325509156` is the result of the calculation performed to solve the problem.\n\n**Summary of the Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio Formula:** The ratio of luminosities is given by $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n2.  **Radius and Area:** Given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$, the area ratio $(R_1/R_2)^2$ is $1.5^2 = 2.25$.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$ depends on the Doppler shift of Star 2, since the observed peak wavelengths are the same.

Its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_2/c)$\n\n6.  **Finding the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   From Wien's Law, $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2}/\\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   Rearranging the equation from the previous step: $\\frac{\\lambda_{emitted,2}}{\\lambda_{emitted,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (2.25) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4$\n    Using the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c = 3 \\times 10^5$ km/s:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 700 / 300000}\\right)^4$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times (0.99767)^4 \\approx 2.2291$\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the mass ratio is extra information not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThe code execution resulted in `2.22908325509156`. Let's analyze this result and the reasoning process.\n\n### Reasoning and Confirmation\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio Formula:** The core of the problem lies in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which gives the luminosity (L) of a black body as `L = 4πR²σT⁴`. The ratio of luminosities for Star 1 and Star 2 is:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`\n\n2.  **Radius Factor:** The problem states `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so `R1/R2 = 1.5`. The radius factor in the luminosity ratio is:\n    `(R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`.\n\n3.  **Temperature Factor:**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation (`λ_em`): `T ∝ 1/λ_em`. Therefore, `T1/T2 = λ_em2 / λ_em1`.\n    *   The astronomers observed the *same* peak wavelength (`λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`). However, the temperature is determined by the wavelength *emitted* by the star in its own reference frame, not the one we observe, which can be affected by the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star 1, with zero radial velocity (`v1 = 0`), the observed and emitted wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs1 = λ_em1`.\n    *   For Star 2, which is moving away at `v2 = 700 km/s`, its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength. The relationship is given by the relativistic Doppler shift formula: `λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * √[(1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)]`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`, we have `λ_em1 = λ_em2 * √[(1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)]`.\n    *   We can now find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation: `λ_em2 / λ_em1 = 1 / √[(1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)] = √[(1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c)]`.\n    *   So, `T1/T2 = √[(1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c)]`.\n    *   The temperature factor in the luminosity ratio is the fourth power of this: `(T1/T2)⁴ = ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))²`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Combining the factors: `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))²`.\n    *   The term `(1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c)` is less than 1 because `v2` is positive. Squaring it results in a number that is still less than 1.\n    *   Therefore, the final luminosity ratio `L1/L2` must be slightly less than 2.25.\n    *   Looking at the options:\n        *   A) ~2.23 (Less than 2.25)\n        *   B) ~2.25 (Equal to 2.25, which would imply T1=T2)\n        *   C) ~2.32 (Greater than 2.25)\n        *   D) ~2.35 (Greater than 2.25)\n    *   Logically, only option A can be correct. The code execution confirms this by yielding `2.229083...`, which rounds to **2.23**.\n\nThe extraneous information about the mass of the stars is not needed for solving this specific problem based on black body radiation laws.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (`L1`) to the luminosity of Star_2 (`L2`), which is `L1 / L2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body radiator, is given by the formula `L = 4πR²σT⁴`, where `R` is the star's radius, `T` is its absolute surface temperature, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars, we can set up the ratio:\n    `L1 / L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴)`\n    The constants `4π` and `σ` cancel out, leaving:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`\n\n4.  **Determine the Ratio of Radii (R1/R2):** The problem explicitly states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.\n    `R1 = 1.5 * R2`\n    Therefore, the ratio `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Ratio of Temperatures (T1/T2):**\n    *   **Recall Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a black body's temperature to its peak emission wavelength (`λ_max`) in its rest frame: `T = b / λ_max_rest`, where `b` is Wien's constant. This means `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_max_rest`.\n    *   So, the temperature ratio `T1 / T2` is equal to the inverse ratio of their rest-frame peak wavelengths: `T1 / T2 = λ_max_rest2 / λ_max_rest1`.\n    *   **Incorporate the Doppler Effect:** The astronomers measured the *observed* peak wavelengths (`λ_obs`), which are affected by the stars' radial velocities. The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the relativistic Doppler shift formula: `λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`, where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   **Apply to each star:**\n        *   For Star_1: `v1 = 0 km/s`. So, `λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * sqrt((1+0)/(1-0)) = λ_rest1`.\n        *   For Star_2: `v2 = 700 km/s`. So, `λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`.\n    *   **Use the given information:** The problem states the observed peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`.\n    *   Therefore, `λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`.\n    *   Rearrange this equation to find the ratio of rest wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n        `λ_max_rest2 / λ_max_rest1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`.\n    *   Now, substitute this back into the temperature ratio:\n        `T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the main luminosity ratio equation:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`\n    `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))]⁴`\n    The square root and the power of 4 simplify, as `(sqrt(x))⁴ = x²`:\n    `L1 / L2 = (2.25) * [(1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c)]²`\n\n7.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** Plug in the known values:\n    *   `v2 = 700 km/s`\n    *   `c` (speed of light) `≈ 299792.458 km/s`\n    The calculation was performed using the provided Python interpreter:\n    ```python\n    # Speed of light in km/s\n    c = 299792.458\n    # Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\n    v2 = 700.0\n    # Ratio of radii, R1/R2\n    R_ratio = 1.5\n\n    # The formula for the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * ((T1/T2)^4)\n    # We found that (T1/T2)^4 = ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))^2\n    beta = v2 / c\n    luminosity_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\n    print(luminosity_ratio)\n    ```\n    The output of the code is `2.22908325509156`.\n\n8.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value `2.22908...` is approximately `2.23`.

Use the given information that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2)^2 = 2.25$.\n3.  Determine the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$ by combining Wien's Displacement Law ($\\lambda_{max,rest} \\propto 1/T$) with the Doppler shift formula ($\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1+v_r/c)$).\n4.  Given that the observed peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$), and that Star 1 has zero radial velocity while Star 2 has $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, we derive the relationship between the true temperatures: $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n5.

I will now explain the result and provide the final answer.\n\n### Final Reasoning\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to compute the ratio of luminosities, $L_1/L_2$.\n2.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity $L$ of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $R$ is the radius and $T$ is the surface temperature.\n3.  **Luminosity Ratio:** The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n4.  **Given Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n5.  **Temperature Ratio (Wien's Law & Doppler Effect):**\n    *   According to Wien's Displacement Law, the temperature $T$ is inversely proportional to the *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$), so $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}}$.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   We must relate the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength using the Doppler effect formula: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star 1, $v_{r,1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2, $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s}$, so $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging gives the ratio of emitted wavelengths: $\\frac{\\lambda_{em,2}}{\\lambda_{em,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}\\right)^4$\n7.  **Numerical Value:** Using the given values:\n    *   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    The calculation was performed by the Python script:\n    `luminosity_ratio = (1.5**2) / (1 + (700000 / 299792458))**4`\n    The code output provided was `2.229107561148499`.\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 2.23. This matches option C. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThe calculation shows the luminosity ratio is approximately `2.2291`.\n\nLooking at the provided options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value `2.2291` is closest to `2.23`.\n\nThe step-by-step reasoning is as follows:\n1.  The luminosity `L` is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `L = 4πR²σT⁴`.\n2.  The ratio of luminosities is `L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`.\n3.  Given `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`, the radius term `(R₁/R₂)²` is `1.5² = 2.25`.\n4.  The observed peak wavelength `λ_obs` is related to the emitted wavelength `λ_em` by the Doppler effect: `λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v/c)`.\n5.  The emitted wavelength is related to temperature by Wien's Law: `λ_em = b/T`.\n6.  For Star 1, `v₁=0`, so `λ_obs,₁ = λ_em,₁ = b/T₁`.\n7.  For Star 2, `v₂=700 km/s`, so `λ_obs,₂ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c) = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n8.  The problem states `λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂`. Therefore, `b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n9.  This simplifies to the temperature ratio `T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n10. Substituting this back into the luminosity ratio gives: `L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴`.\n11. Plugging in the values `v₂ = 700 km/s` and `c ≈ 299792.458 km/s` yields the result `~2.2291`, which rounds to `2.23`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThe code execution returned the value `2.22908326`.\n\nThis result confirms the reasoning:\n\n1.  The luminosity ratio is given by the formula L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴.\n2.  We were given R1/R2 = 1.5.\n3.  We derived the temperature ratio (T1/T2) based on the Doppler shift affecting the observed peak wavelength of Star_2, leading to (T1/T2)⁴ = ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))².\n4.

The ratio of luminosities for Star 1 and Star 2 is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, so:\n    $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the intrinsic peak wavelength at which it emits radiation ($\\lambda_{emit}$): $T = b/\\lambda_{emit}$, where b is Wien's constant. Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b/\\lambda_{emit,1}}{b/\\lambda_{emit,2}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{emit,2}}{\\lambda_{emit,1}}$\n\n4.  **Relating Observed and Emitted Wavelengths**: The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) due to the Doppler effect: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit}(1 + v_r/c)$.\n    *   For Star 1, $v_{r,1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1}(1+0) = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2, $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n5.  **Solving for the Temperature Ratio**: Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,1} = \\lambda_{emit,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    Rearranging this gives us the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{emit,2}}{\\lambda_{emit,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$\n    This means the temperature ratio is:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}\\right)^4$\n    Plugging in the values ($v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^5$ km/s):\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (2.25) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 700/(3 \\times 10^5)}\\right)^4$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 0.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.229$\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nThe user wants me to solve a problem in astrophysics to find the ratio of luminosities between two stars.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$.\n\n**2. List the Given Information:**\n*   Radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2: $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$.\n*   Mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times the mass of Star_2: $M_1 = 1.5 M_2$. (This is likely extraneous information for this problem).\n*   The observed peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,2}}$.\n*   Radial velocity of Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s.\n*   Radial velocity of Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s.\n*   The stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.\n\n**3. Identify Relevant Physical Principles:**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a spherical black body is given by the formula $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely related to its intrinsic (or rest-frame) peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max}}$): $T = b / \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max}}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n*   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is related to the rest-frame wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) by the formula for Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light. A positive velocity means the object is moving away (redshift).\n\n**4. Formulate the Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Write the luminosity ratio.**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4) = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n*   **Step 2: Relate temperatures to peak wavelengths.**\n    Using Wien's Law, we know that temperature is inversely proportional to the *rest-frame* peak wavelength ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max}}$). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}} / \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}}$\n\n*   **Step 3: Use the Doppler Effect to find the rest-frame wavelengths.**\n    We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,2}}$. Let's call this value $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$.\n    For Star 1 ($v_{r,1} = 0$):\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}} (1 + 0/c) \\implies \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$.\n    For Star 2 ($v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s):\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    So, $\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths.**\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)}{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the temperature ratio.**\n    Substitute the result from Step 4 into the expression from Step 2:\n    $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    This indicates that Star 1 is cooler than Star 2. Because Star 2 is moving away, its light is redshifted to a longer wavelength. For it to be *observed* at the same peak wavelength as the stationary Star 1, its *actual* peak emission must be at a shorter wavelength, implying a higher temperature.\n\n*   **Step 6: Calculate the final luminosity ratio.**\n    Substitute all the known ratios into the formula from Step 1:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}\\right)^4$\n    $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 \\times (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^{-4}$\n\n**5.

This leads to the relationship T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n3.  **Final Formula:** Combining these gives the expression used in the code:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴**\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The code correctly calculates the value of this expression using v₂ = 700 km/s and c = 299792.458 km/s.\n    *   The result is **2.229107561148499**.\n\n5.  **Matching with Options:** The question asks for an approximate factor from the following choices:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.25\n\n    When we round our calculated result, `2.2291...`, to two decimal places, we get **2.23**.\n\nTherefore, the code output is not an error; it is the correct calculation that confirms **Option C** is the right answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe user has requested the solution to the astronomy problem again. My previous reasoning stands correct and is re-summarized here.\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship for luminosity:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`\n    where `R` is the radius, `T` is the surface temperature, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Formulate the ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 (`L₁ / L₂`).\n    `L₁ / L₂ = (4 * π * R₁² * σ * T₁⁴) / (4 * π * R₂² * σ * T₂⁴)`\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    `L₁ / L₂ = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴`\n\n3.  **Incorporate the given information about the radii:** The problem states `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`. Therefore, the radius ratio is `R₁ / R₂ = 1.5`.\n    Squaring this gives: `(R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`.\n\n4.  **Determine the temperature ratio (`T₁ / T₂`):**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation (`λ_emitted`): `T = b / λ_emitted`, where `b` is a constant. This means `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_emitted`.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is `T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_observed_1 = λ_observed_2`). However, Star 2 is moving, so its emitted wavelength is Doppler-shifted.\n    *   The Doppler shift formula for light is `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)`, where `v_r` is the radial velocity (positive for moving away) and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star 1, `v₁ = 0`, so `λ_observed_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   For Star 2, `v₂ = 700 km/s`, so `λ_observed_2 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v₂ / c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_observed_1 = λ_observed_2`, we have: `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v₂ / c)`.\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio we need for temperature: `λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / (1 + v₂ / c)`.\n    *   Thus, the temperature ratio is `T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂ / c)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and calculate the final luminosity ratio:**\n    Substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    `L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (1 / (1 + v₂ / c))⁴`\n    `L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂ / c)⁴`\n\n6.  **Perform the numerical calculation:** Using the values `v₂ = 700 km/s` and `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The code output provided by the system, `2.2291075611484996`, is the result of this calculation.\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   The calculated value is `~2.229`.\n    *   Option A) ~2.35\n    *   Option B) ~2.32\n    *   Option C) ~2.23\n    *   Option D) ~2.25\n\nThe calculated result `2.229` is best approximated by `2.23`. The information regarding the stars' masses is extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nBased on the executed code, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.2291.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 rounds to 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to compute the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 ($L_1 / L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Luminosity:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $A$ is the surface area of the star ($A = 4\\pi R^2$ for a sphere).\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the surface temperature of the star.\n    Substituting the area, the formula becomes:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the formula above, the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2 is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:**\n    *   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2: $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    *   The mass information ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not directly used in the Stefan-Boltzmann law and can be considered extraneous for this calculation.\n    *   The radial velocities are $v_1 = 0$ km/s and $v_2 = 700$ km/s.\n    *   The \"wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the observed peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max, obs}$) of their blackbody spectra. So, $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n\n5.  **Relate Temperature to Wavelength:** According to Wien's Displacement Law, the intrinsic surface temperature ($T$) of a black body is related to its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max, emit}$):\n    $\\lambda_{max, emit} = \\frac{b}{T}$\n    where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Effect:** The radial velocity of a star causes a Doppler shift, changing the wavelength of light we observe.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Conventionally, a positive radial velocity indicates the star is moving away from us (recession), which causes a redshift (observed wavelength is longer). The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$\n        Therefore, $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):** We can now find the relationship between the temperatures of the two stars.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{max, emit, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    *   Now, substitute Wien's Law ($ \\lambda_{max, emit} = b/T $):\n        $\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    *   Solving for the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula from step 3:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}\\right)^4$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^2$\n\n9.  **Perform the Calculation:** We use the given values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and the speed of light $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s.\n\n    The ratio $v_2/c$ is:\n    $v_2/c = 700 / 299792.458 \\approx 0.00233496$\n\n    Now, substitute this value into the expression for the luminosity ratio:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1 - 0.00233496}{1 + 0.00233496}\\right)^2$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{0.99766504}{1.00233496}\\right)^2$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (0.9953406)^2$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times 0.9907034$\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.22908$\n\n10. **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of ~2.23 is closest to option A.\n\n    If we had assumed astronomers corrected for the Doppler shift and that the *emitted* peak wavelengths were the same, then $T_1$ would equal $T_2$, and the ratio would be exactly $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$. However, the wording \"appeared brightest\" and the explicit inclusion of the radial velocity values suggest that the Doppler shift must be accounted for. The small but definite difference between 2.25 and 2.23 is the key to solving this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe luminosity of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n\nWhere:\n*   $L$ is the luminosity\n*   $A$ is the surface area of the star ($A = 4\\pi R^2$, with R being the radius)\n*   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n*   $T$ is the surface temperature of the star\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 and Star 2, $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n$L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n$L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\nFrom the problem, we are given:\n*   $R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n*   $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the temperatures, $T_1 / T_2$. We can do this using the information about the peak wavelengths.\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. However, this observed wavelength can be affected by the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity. The relationship between the wavelength emitted by the source ($\\lambda_{em}$) and the observed wavelength is given by:\n$\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} (1 + \\frac{v_r}{c})$\nwhere $v_r$ is the radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star 1:\n*   $v_{r1} = 0 \\text{ km/s}$\n*   $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1} (1 + \\frac{0}{c}) = \\lambda_{em,1}$\n\nFor Star 2:\n*   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s}$\n*   $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n\nSince $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n$\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n\nWien's Displacement Law relates a star's surface temperature to its *emitted* peak wavelength:\n$\\lambda_{em} = \\frac{b}{T}$ where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n\nSubstituting this into our wavelength equation:\n$\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n\nCanceling $b$ and rearranging to find the temperature ratio $T_1 / T_2$:\n$\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n\nNow we can substitute this temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio formula:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = (2.25) \\times (\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c})^4$\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n*   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^8})^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 0.002333...)^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4}$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2289$\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives 2.23.
