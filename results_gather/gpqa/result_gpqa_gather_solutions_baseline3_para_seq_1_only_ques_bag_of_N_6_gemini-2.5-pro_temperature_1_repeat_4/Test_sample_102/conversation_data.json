Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substituents are all **meta** with respect to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃)**: A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br)**: A deactivating group but an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂)**: A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (-NH₂)**: A strongly activating group and an **ortho-, para-director**. (Relevant as it's formed by reducing a nitro group, a common tactic).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Direct Synthesis vs. Indirect Synthesis\n\nA direct synthesis would involve adding the three groups sequentially to the benzene ring. For example:\n*   Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration.\n*   Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n\nLet's consider the sequence: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration.\n1.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone**. The -COCH₃ group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone**. Bromine adds meta to the acetyl group. This works.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   In 3-bromoacetophenone, the -COCH₃ group (at C1) directs meta (to C5). The -Br group (at C3) directs ortho/para (to C2, C4, C6). The directing effects are conflicting.\n    *   Furthermore, adding a third deactivating group to a ring that already has two is difficult and typically results in low yields. The question asks for a **high-yield** synthesis.\n\nThis suggests that a more sophisticated, indirect route is required. The presence of steps like `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO₂ to -NH₂) and `NaNO₂/HCl` followed by `H₃PO₂` (diazotization and deamination, i.e., removal of the -NH₂ group) in the options strongly hints at a common synthetic strategy where an amino group is used as a powerful director and then removed at the end.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Options with the Deamination Strategy\n\nThe sequence `... -> Fe/HCl -> NaNO₂/HCl -> H₃PO₂` implies that a nitro group is introduced, used to create an amino directing group, and then this group is removed from the molecule. Let's trace the options with this in mind.\n\n*   **Option A**: Starts with bromination, then nitration. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is too strongly deactivated by the nitro and bromo groups. So, **A is incorrect**.\n*   **Option B**: The sequence of steps i-iv (`Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline -> Diazonium salt -> Benzene`) is circular and makes no sense. So, **B is incorrect**.\n*   **Option D**: Involves reacting aniline with `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`. This Friedel-Crafts acylation is problematic on aniline. Even if we assume it works or that it implies N-acylation, the subsequent steps do not logically lead to the target without missing steps (like hydrolysis). For example, step (vi) `NaNO₂/HCl` requires a primary amine, but the product from step (v) would be an acetanilide (an amide). So, **D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: Let's trace this sequence carefully. This path turns out to be a clever, multi-step synthesis that achieves the desired product in high yield.\n\n    i.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone**.\n        *   An acetyl group is added. It's a meta-director.\n\n    ii. **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n        *   The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to position 3.\n\n    iii. **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**.\n        *   This is a key step. The directing effects of -COCH₃ (meta) and -Br (ortho, para) are conflicting. While the 5-nitro isomer is also formed, the 4-nitro isomer is a significant product that is required for the subsequent steps of this sequence.\n\n    iv. **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone**.\n        *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. This introduces a powerful activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n\n    v.  **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**.\n        *   This is the crucial step for regiocontrol. We are nitrating the ring. Let's look at the directors:\n            *   -NH₂ (at C4) is a powerful activator and directs ortho/para (to C3-occupied, C5).\n            *   -COCH₃ (at C1) is a deactivator and directs meta (to C5).\n            *   -Br (at C3) is a deactivator and directs ortho/para (to C2, C6).\n        *   Both the strongest activating group (-NH₂) and the -COCH₃ group direct the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This concerted direction ensures the reaction is regioselective and high-yield.\n\n    vi. **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO₂/HCl → Diazonium salt**.\n        *   The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n\n    vii. **Diazonium salt + H₃PO₂ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n        *   The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis entire sequence successfully constructs the target molecule with excellent control over the placement of the substituents, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (a benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution is crucial:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (by induction) but an ortho/para-director (by resonance).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider the most straightforward ways to introduce these three groups. The order of introduction is critical.\n\n*   **Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    i.   **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.** The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    ii.  **Acetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position (C3). This works well.\n    iii. **3-Nitroacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now the ring has a -COCH3 group at C1 and a -NO2 group at C3. Both are meta-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to C5. This is an excellent step, as the directors reinforce each other, leading to a high yield of the desired product.\n    *Conclusion:* This 3-step synthesis is logical and efficient. However, this sequence is not among the options provided. All options are 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex pathway is intended.\n\n*   **Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration** (This matches the beginning of Option A)\n    i.  **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.**\n    ii. **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs bromine to C3. This works.\n    iii. **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Now the ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho/para-director (-Br at C3). They compete. The -COCH3 group directs to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In such cases, the o,p-director usually determines the position of substitution, leading to a mixture of products, primarily nitration at C2, C4, and C6. The desired product (nitration at C5) would be a minor product. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nSince the straightforward routes are either not an option or do not provide a high yield, we must consider a more sophisticated strategy, likely one involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed. The presence of the `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, and `H3PO2` sequence in the options strongly points to the reduction of a nitro group to an amine, followed by diazotization and deamination (removal of the amino group). This is a classic strategy to achieve \"difficult\" substitution patterns.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze the options based on this understanding. We are looking for a logical sequence that uses a temporary amino group to correctly position the substituents and then removes it.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    As discussed, step (iii) gives a low yield. Furthermore, the sequence starting from step (iv) is illogical. It involves reducing the nitro group just added, then trying to nitrate the resulting highly reactive amine (which would be messy), and then removing a group. This pathway is flawed.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene (deamination with H3PO2). This is a futile loop that achieves nothing.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    This sequence starts by making p-bromonitrobenzene (major product). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring, which would fail or give an extremely low yield. This option is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    This sequence appears the most plausible, despite some ambiguously written steps which are common in such problems. Let's interpret it as a strategic synthesis:\n    i.  **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene.**\n    ii. **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline.**\n    iii. **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> p-Aminoacetophenone.** While Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline itself fails, these reagents can be used for a Fries Rearrangement of an initially formed N-acyl aniline, yielding p-aminoacetophenone as the major product. This strategically places the acetyl group on the ring, para to a powerful directing amino group.\n    iv. **p-Aminoacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone.** The powerful activating ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 will direct the incoming bromine to one of the ortho positions (C3 or C5).\n    v.  **3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone.** For this step to work cleanly, the amino group must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation). Let's assume this is implicit. The directing effects would then be: -NHAc (o,p at C4) directs to C5; -COCH3 (m at C1) directs to C5; -Br (o,p at C3) directs elsewhere (C2, C6). The reinforcing effects of the acetamido and acetyl groups strongly favor nitration at C5. The amino group would be deprotected afterwards.\n    vi. **3-Bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium salt.** The temporary amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium group.\n    vii. **Diazonium salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis detailed pathway, which uses the amino group at C4 as a temporary directing group, successfully constructs the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern and yields the final product. It is the only sequence that represents a coherent and effective (though complex) synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   The substituents are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe key to a high-yield synthesis is to introduce the groups in an order where their directing effects work together (are reinforcing) or at least do not conflict in a way that produces multiple isomers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → **Bromobenzene**.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene is treated with HNO3/H2SO4. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director. This will produce a mixture of *o*-bromonitrobenzene and *p*-bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n*   iii) The product from step ii (e.g., p-bromonitrobenzene) is treated with CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) makes the ring too electron-poor to undergo acylation. Therefore, this step would fail or give an extremely low yield. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitrobenzene**.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → **Aniline**. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   iii) Aniline is treated with CH3COCl/AlCl3. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that puts a positive charge on the nitrogen, strongly deactivating the ring and preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...**\n*   This sequence starts with:\n    *   i) Nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Reduction to aniline.\n    *   iii) Diazotization of aniline to benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   iv) Reduction of the diazonium salt with H3PO2 to remove the nitrogen group.\n*   The net result of steps i-iv is the conversion of benzene back into benzene. This sequence is nonsensical for synthesizing the target molecule. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   i) **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **Acetophenone**. This introduces the acetyl group (-COCH3). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n*   ii) **Bromination:** Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to position 3. The major product will be 3-bromoacetophenone. This creates the desired 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   iii) **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. Let's look at the directing effects of the two existing groups:\n    *   The **-COCH3** group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, so it directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The **-Br** group at position 3 is an *ortho, para*-director. It directs the incoming -NO2 group to its ortho positions (positions 2 and 4) and its para position (position 6). However, considering the combined directing effects, the position that is *ortho* to Br and *meta* to COCH3 is position 5.\n    *   Both existing groups reinforce the directing of the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This leads to a high yield of the desired single product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) listed in option D are unnecessary as the target molecule has already been formed. They appear to be distractors. However, the initial three steps constitute a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis of the target product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, only the sequence starting with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration (the first three steps of option D) provides a viable and efficient route to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   Substituents are at positions 1 (-COCH3), 3 (-Br), and 5 (-NO2).\n*   The three substituents are all in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating, ortho,para-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n**Evaluation of a Direct Synthesis Route:**\nA simple, direct synthesis might be:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the -NO2 group to the meta position.\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In 3-nitroacetophenone, both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) are meta-directors. They cooperatively direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5.\n\nThis three-step synthesis is regiochemically correct. However, the final step (bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone) would be very slow and require harsh conditions because the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). This would not be a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The provided options are all seven steps long, suggesting a more complex, indirect route is necessary to achieve a good yield. Such routes often involve using a temporary directing group that is later modified or removed. The presence of reagents for reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) strongly points to the use of an amino group (-NH2) as a powerful ortho,para-directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this understanding.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These options start with the nitration of benzene, followed by reduction to form aniline. However, Option B proposes a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (iii), which is problematic as the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and making the reaction fail or give poor yields of the meta product. Option C proposes a sequence (i-iv) that converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene, which is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option D:** This option starts by making p-bromonitrobenzene (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of this product. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, and the nitro group is a very strong deactivator. Therefore, this step would fail, making Option D incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence appears to be the most chemically sound, employing the strategy of using a temporary directing group. Let's trace the steps carefully:\n\n    i) **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone**: Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n\n    ii) **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone**: The meta-directing acetyl group leads to bromination at the C3 position.\n\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**: This is a crucial step. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). The directing effects conflict. However, substitution is most likely at C4 (ortho to the o,p-director and meta to the m-director) and C6. Position 4 is generally favored. The product formed is 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone, which is the key intermediate for the next steps.\n\n    iv) **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone**: The nitro group is selectively reduced to a primary amine.\n\n    v) **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**: Now, a second nitration is performed. The powerful activating and ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 dictates the position of the new substituent. It directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position, C5 (C3 is already occupied). The other groups on the ring (-COCH3 and -Br) are also consistent with substitution at C5. This step has excellent regioselectivity.\n\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt formation**: The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n\n    vii) **Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**: The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination reaction). This leaves the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups in the desired 1,3,5-relationship.\n\nThis sequence is a clever and synthetically valid route that uses an amino group (generated from an initial nitro group) as a temporary directing group to install the final nitro group at the correct position with high selectivity, before being removed. This pathway would lead to a high yield of the target product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    To plan a synthesis, we must consider how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies:**\n    The main challenge is introducing the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at a position that is *meta* to the other two groups. This suggests that the order of reactions is critical.\n\n    Let's consider the final step of the synthesis. Which group should be added last?\n\n    *   **Case 1: Add the acetyl group last (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).**\n        The precursor would be 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This molecule contains two deactivating groups, one of which is the strongly deactivating nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions, including acylation, generally fail on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene and its derivatives. Therefore, this route is not feasible for a high-yield synthesis. The acetyl group must be introduced earlier.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Add the nitro group or the bromo group last.**\n        This means the synthesis must start with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene.\n        *   **Step 1: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone.\n            Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n            Now we have the acetyl group on the ring, which is a *meta*-director.\n\n        Now, we need to add the -Br and -NO2 groups to the meta positions (3 and 5). We have two choices for the next step: bromination or nitration.\n\n        *   **Path A: Brominate first, then nitrate.**\n            *   **Step 2a: Bromination.** Acetophenone is treated with Br2 and FeBr3. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine will be added at position 3.\n                Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n            *   **Step 3a: Nitration.** We now nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has an acetyl group (m-director) at position 1 and a bromo group (o,p-director) at position 3.\n                *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n                *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n                *   Both groups are deactivating. Electrophilic attack is generally disfavored at positions ortho to a deactivating group. Position 5 is meta to both substituents and is the least deactivated position. Therefore, nitration will predominantly occur at position 5.\n                3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule).\n                This sequence is chemically sound and known to produce the desired product in good yield.\n\n        *   **Path B: Nitrate first, then brominate.**\n            *   **Step 2b: Nitration.** Acetophenone is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the nitro group to position 3.\n                Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.\n            *   **Step 3b: Bromination.** We now brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring has two *meta*-directing groups at positions 1 (-COCH3) and 3 (-NO2). Both groups reinforce each other, directing the incoming bromo group to position 5.\n                3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule).\n                While this path also leads to the correct product, the ring in step 3b is more strongly deactivated (due to -NO2 being more deactivating than -Br) than the ring in step 3a. This would require harsher reaction conditions and likely result in a lower yield. Thus, Path A is the superior \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n4.  **Match the Best Strategy to the Given Options:**\n    The best synthesis route we identified is:\n    i) Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3)\n    ii) Bromination (Br2/FeBr3)\n    iii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    *   A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ... — Incorrect start.\n    *   B) **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4** ; iv) Fe/HCl ... — The first three steps perfectly match our optimal synthesis route. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are extraneous and would modify the target molecule, indicating a potential flaw in the question's construction. However, the initial sequence is the only one provided that correctly and efficiently leads to the desired product.\n    *   C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2... — This sequence starts by making benzene from benzene, which is incorrect.\n    *   D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... — This would lead to 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, and subsequent acylation would fail or give the wrong isomer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option B is the only choice that begins with the correct, high-yield sequence of reactions to produce 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Despite the superfluous steps listed afterward, the core of the synthesis presented is the most valid among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's identify its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are *meta* to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern). This is a key feature that will guide the synthesis strategy.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthetic Routes**\n\nA common strategy is to add the groups one by one. Let's consider the most logical direct route, even if it's not an option, to establish a baseline.\n\n*   **Route X (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination):**\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. (The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director).\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group directs the -NO2 group to the *meta* position).\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. (The ring now has two *meta*-directors: -COCH3 at position 1 and -NO2 at position 3. Both direct the incoming Br+ to position 5).\n\nThis three-step synthesis is highly regioselective and would produce the desired product. Although the final bromination step might be slow because the ring is deactivated by two groups, it is chemically sound. Since this sequence is not among the options, it implies a more complex route is required, likely one that circumvents potential issues like low reactivity or side reactions. The presence of reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl) and diazotization/deamination (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a strategy involving a temporary amino directing group.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   Step (i) gives nitrobenzene. Step (ii) gives aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a strongly deactivating complex (-NH2+AlCl3), which prevents the acylation of the ring. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   Step (i) gives bromobenzene. Step (ii) is the nitration of bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. This step produces a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, with only a tiny amount of the *meta* isomer (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene). This violates the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...\n    *   This sequence as written is nonsensical. Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally, H3PO2 removes the diazonium group, converting it back to benzene. This futile cycle makes the option incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    This sequence is long and complex, suggesting it might employ an advanced strategy. Let's analyze it step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation. (OK)\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** Bromination. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. (OK)\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone:** Nitration. Here we have competing directors: -COCH3 (*meta*) and -Br (*ortho, para*). The -Br group is less deactivating, so it primarily controls the position of substitution, directing the nitro group to its *ortho* and *para* positions. The major product would be the *ortho* isomer (relative to Br), 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone, as the other ortho position is sterically hindered. This step is regioselective for an intermediate, not the final product.\n    4.  **iv) 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone → 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone:** Reduction of the nitro group with Fe/HCl. (OK)\n    5.  **v) 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone → 3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone:** Nitration. This is the key step. The directing effects are:\n        *   -NH2 (at 4): A powerful activating *ortho, para*-director. It directs to position 5 (*ortho*).\n        *   -COCH3 (at 1): A *meta*-director. It directs to position 5.\n        *   -Br (at 3): An *ortho, para*-director.\n        The powerful activating -NH2 group, reinforced by the -COCH3 group, strongly directs the new nitro group to position 5. This step should be high-yield and highly regioselective (assuming conditions prevent full protonation of the amine).\n    6.  **vi) 3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazonium salt:** Diazotization of the amino group at position 4 with NaNO2/HCl. (OK)\n    7.  **vii) Diazonium salt → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Deamination (removal of the diazonium group) with H3PO2. Removing the group at position 4 leaves the acetyl (1), bromo (3), and nitro (5) groups in the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n\nThis sequence represents a sophisticated synthetic strategy where a nitro group is temporarily introduced, converted to a powerful amino directing group to control the placement of the final substituent, and then removed. Although complex, each step is logical and contributes to the high-yield synthesis of the specific isomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption B outlines a valid, albeit intricate, synthetic route that correctly manipulates directing group effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern in high yield. The other options contain fatal chemical flaws.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The desired product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n    All three substituents are *meta* to each other (positions 1, 3, 5).\n\n2.  **Analyze Substituent Directing Effects:**\n    In electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly electron-withdrawing, strongly deactivating, and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Electron-withdrawing (by induction) but electron-donating (by resonance), deactivating overall, and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Constraint:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acetylation using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) do not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO₂ group.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies:**\n    The goal is to add these three groups in an order that results in the 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n    *   **Strategy 1: Introduce a *meta*-director first.** This is the most logical approach to achieve a 1,3,5-pattern. We can start with either nitration or acetylation.\n        *   **Path A (Start with Nitration):** Benzene → Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a *meta*-director. However, the next step cannot be Friedel-Crafts acetylation because nitrobenzene is too deactivated. This path is not viable if we need to introduce the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts.\n        *   **Path B (Start with Acetylation):** Benzene → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a promising start. The ring is deactivated but can undergo further substitutions like nitration and bromination.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Start with the *ortho, para*-director.**\n        *   **Path C (Start with Bromination):** Benzene → Bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *o,p*-director. Subsequent nitration or acetylation would yield a mixture of *ortho* and *para* products, not the desired *meta* substitution pattern. This is an inefficient way to get to the 1,3,5 product.\n\n    Based on this initial analysis, starting with acetylation (Path B) is the most logical strategy.\n\n4.  **Develop the Synthesis from Acetophenone:**\n    Starting with acetophenone, we need to add a nitro group and a bromo group. We have two possible sequences:\n\n    *   **Sequence (i): Acetylation → Nitration → Bromination**\n        1.  `Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone`\n        2.  `Acetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Nitroacetophenone` (The -COCH₃ group directs the -NO₂ group to the meta position).\n        3.  `3-Nitroacetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one` (Now, both the -COCH₃ and -NO₂ groups are *meta*-directors, and they both direct the incoming Br⁺ to the 5-position. This reaction should have high regioselectivity, leading to a high yield of the desired isomer).\n\n    *   **Sequence (ii): Acetylation → Bromination → Nitration**\n        1.  `Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone`\n        2.  `Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone` (The -COCH₃ group directs the -Br group to the meta position).\n        3.  `3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one` (Here, we have conflicting directors. The -COCH₃ group directs *meta* (to position 5), while the -Br group directs *ortho* and *para* (to positions 2, 4, 6). While the 1,3,5-product is often major, other isomers can form, potentially lowering the yield).\n\n    Both sequences are plausible. Sequence (i) is theoretically better for a \"high-yield\" synthesis due to better control of regiochemistry in the final step. However, we must check which sequence is present in the options.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A)** i) Nitration... As discussed, FC-acetylation (vi) on a derivative of nitrobenzene would be problematic. Furthermore, a detailed analysis shows this route leads to the wrong isomer (4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone).\n    *   **B)** i) Nitration... ii) Reduction to aniline... This path leads to 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which is not the target product.\n    *   **C)** i) Bromination... ii) Nitration... This leads to *o,p*-products. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a deactivated ring (p-bromonitrobenzene), which will fail.\n    *   **D)** i) `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`; ii) `Br₂/FeBr₃`; iii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`... This matches **Sequence (ii)** described above. The first three steps constitute a valid synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical in this context (they appear to describe the reduction and then removal of the nitro group just added), suggesting a flawed question. However, the initial sequence is the only one among the options that correctly produces the desired compound.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The sequence of reactions starting with acetylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration (steps i, ii, and iii of option D) is a valid, if not perfectly ideal, method to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The other options either fail chemically or lead to incorrect products. Therefore, despite the erroneous later steps listed, option D contains the correct core synthesis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   The substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The numbering indicates the acetyl group is at position 1, the bromine is at position 3, and the nitro group is at position 5.\n*   This is a **1,3,5-substitution pattern**. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents direct new ones to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and **meta-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and **ortho, para-director**. It is formed by the reduction of a nitro group (e.g., with Fe/HCl).\n\nThe key challenge is the 1,3,5-pattern, especially with the presence of an ortho, para-director (-Br). A simple sequence of three electrophilic substitutions (acylation, bromination, nitration in any order) is unlikely to work because the directing effects will conflict at some point, leading to a mixture of isomers instead of a high-yield synthesis of the desired product.\n\nFor example, if we try the simple sequence of Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination:\n1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone\n2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 3-Nitroacetophenone (The meta-directing acetyl group works perfectly).\n3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, both the -COCH3 group and the -NO2 group are meta-directors, and they both direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This is a valid synthesis. However, this simple 3-step sequence is not among the options.\n\nThe provided options are all 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex strategy is required, likely involving functional group interconversions. The presence of reagents like `Fe/HCl` (reduction of NO2 to NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization of NH2), and `H3PO2` (deamination, i.e., replacement of a diazonium group with hydrogen) strongly suggests a \"placeholder amine\" strategy. This strategy uses an amino group to direct substituents to desired positions and is then removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options Using the Placeholder Amine Strategy**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step to see if it leads to the target molecule in high yield.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n    *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. This reaction fails on anilines because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring so strongly that acylation does not occur. Thus, sequence A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...`\n    *   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n    *   iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 -> Benzene. This sequence of steps just converts benzene back to benzene, making it an illogical and inefficient pathway. Thus, sequence B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene -> 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (The para isomer is the major product).\n    *   iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3: In this step, both -Br (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) direct the incoming acetyl group to the position ortho to Br and meta to NO2. The product would be 4-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone. This is not the correct isomer arrangement to lead to the final 1,3,5-product. Thus, sequence C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    Let's trace this path carefully:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at position 3.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone:** Here we have conflicting directors. The -Br at C3 is o,p-directing (to C2, C4, C6) and activating relative to the meta positions. The -COCH3 at C1 is m-directing (to C3, C5). The directing effect of the o,p-directing halogen is dominant, and nitration occurs primarily at the sterically accessible position para to the bromine, which is C4. This gives the desired intermediate for the next step.\n    4.  **iv) 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone:** The nitro group at C4 is reduced to an amino group.\n    5.  **v) 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone:** Now we nitrate this intermediate. This is the crucial directing step.\n        *   The powerful activating -NH2 group (at C4) directs ortho, to C3 and C5.\n        *   The -Br group (at C3) directs para, to C5.\n        *   The -COCH3 group (at C1) directs meta, to C3 and C5.\n        All three groups cooperate to direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This step proceeds with high regioselectivity.\n    6.  **vi) 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt formation:** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    7.  **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The deamination reaction removes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom. This removes the placeholder directing group.\n\nThe final product has the acetyl group at C1, bromine at C3, and nitro group at C5, which is exactly the target molecule. This sequence is chemically sound and all steps are regioselective or produce the required isomer as the major product, leading to a high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The desired product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n    *   It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    In electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing groups on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an *ortho,para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies:**\n    *   **Strategy 1: Sequential substitution on a ring with meta-directors.** A powerful strategy for getting a 1,3,5-pattern is to have two *meta*-directing groups on the ring, as they will both direct a third incoming group to the same position. For example, starting with 3-nitroacetophenone (-COCH3 at C1, -NO2 at C3), both groups would direct an incoming bromine to C5. This leads to the sequence:\n        1.  Acylation (to get acetophenone).\n        2.  Nitration (to get 3-nitroacetophenone).\n        3.  Bromination (to get the final product).\n        This logical sequence (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is not among the options.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Use of a temporary directing group.** Another common method for complex substitution patterns is to use a powerful directing group (like -NH2) to place other groups correctly, and then remove it via diazotization and deamination (e.g., using NaNO2/HCl followed by H3PO2). The presence of these reagents in the options suggests this strategy might be relevant.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2... This sequence starts with nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, diazotizing it, and then removing the diazonium group with H3PO2. This sequence of steps simply converts benzene back into benzene, making it incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...\n        *   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene.\n        *   ii) Bromobenzene -> 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene (this gives a mixture, with the 4-nitro isomer being major, but let's assume we get the meta product).\n        *   iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation on 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by two deactivating groups (-Br and especially -NO2). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D:** This is a long sequence involving deamination reagents. Let's trace it:\n        *   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline (reduction).\n        *   iii) Aniline -> Acetanilide (N-acylation to protect the amine).\n        *   iv) Acetanilide -> p-Bromoacetanilide (bromination occurs para to the activating -NHCOCH3 group).\n        *   v) p-Bromoacetanilide -> 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide (nitration is directed by the stronger activating -NHCOCH3 group to its ortho position).\n        *   The remaining steps (vi, vii) are for deamination. This would first require hydrolysis of the acetanilide to an aniline, and then removal of the -NH2 group. The final product of this entire pathway would be 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which is not the target ketone. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option A:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...\n        *   i) **Benzene -> Acetophenone:** Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n        *   ii) **Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The -COCH3 group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. This is a standard reaction.\n        *   iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone -> Nitration:** Now the ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). The directing effects are in conflict. -COCH3 directs to C5. -Br directs to C2, C4, C6. While this would typically produce a mixture of isomers, the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro product is among them. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are clearly non-viable, this path is the most plausible. The formation of the 1,3,5-isomer is often favored due to steric hindrance at the other possible positions (2, 4, and 6).\n        *   The subsequent steps (iv to vii) in option A are nonsensical if the target molecule is already formed in step (iii). They seem to be included as distractors.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing the options, Option A provides the most direct and chemically plausible route to the target molecule, despite the potential for side products in the nitration step. The other options contain fatal flaws, such as non-viable reactions or the synthesis of an incorrect final molecule. Therefore, Option A represents the best choice for a high-yield synthesis among the given sequences.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position 1: an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   At position 3: a bromine atom (-Br).\n*   At position 5: a nitro group (-NO2).\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing groups on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern is a key clue. To achieve this pattern with high yield, it's most efficient to have two *meta*-directing groups on the ring before introducing the third substituent. Both existing groups would then direct the new group to the same position.\n\nLet's try to build a logical sequence based on this principle:\n\n*   **Step 1: Introduce a *meta*-director.** We can start with either Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the -COCH3 group or nitration to add the -NO2 group. Friedel-Crafts acylation on nitrobenzene is very difficult, so it's better to do the acylation first.\n    *   **Reaction 1 (Acylation):** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is now on the ring. It is a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Step 2: Introduce the second *meta*-director.** The other *meta*-director we need is the nitro group.\n    *   **Reaction 2 (Nitration):** Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group at position 1 directs the incoming nitro group to position 3 (*meta*). This works well.\n\n*   **Step 3: Introduce the final group.** Now we have acetophenone with a -COCH3 group at position 1 and a -NO2 group at position 3. Both are *meta*-directors. We need to add a bromine atom.\n    *   -COCH3 (at C1) directs to C5.\n    *   -NO2 (at C3) directs to C5.\n    *   Since both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the same position (C5), this reaction will have high regioselectivity.\n    *   **Reaction 3 (Bromination):** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   Although the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, making the reaction slow, the directing effects are aligned, leading to a high yield of the desired isomer.\n\nThis logical three-step synthesis is: **Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's check which of the given options matches our logical synthesis, or comes closest to it. The provided options are complex, many involving reduction of a nitro group and subsequent diazotization/deamination (Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2), which is a roundabout way to remove a group. Such complexity is usually only necessary if a more direct route fails badly.\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with Nitration, then reduction to aniline, then tries Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This fails because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired reaction.\n\n*   **Option B:** The sequence of reaction types is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration → ...**.\n    1.  Benzene --(acylation)--> Acetophenone. (Good start)\n    2.  Acetophenone --(bromination)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone. (The acetyl group directs Br *meta*. This step works).\n    3.  3-Bromoacetophenone --(nitration)--> Product. This is the critical step. We have a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br). Their directing effects conflict. The -Br group directs to positions 4 and 6, while the -COCH3 group directs to position 5. The activating (ortho,para-directing) effect of the halogen usually dominates in these cases, leading to nitration at positions 4 and 6. The desired 5-nitro product would be a minor byproduct. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The subsequent steps are irrelevant as the key step fails to produce the correct intermediate in high yield.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with Bromination, then Nitration. This produces 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major) and 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (minor). The next step is Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings like nitro-halo-benzenes.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is problematic as written in most interpretations. For instance, one reading has the sequence Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzene (via deamination), which is circular and pointless. Another interpretation has a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which fails due to the strongly deactivating nitro group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the provided options contain significant chemical flaws:\n*   A, C, and D contain steps that are known to fail under standard conditions (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on strongly deactivated rings).\n*   B describes a sequence of reactions that are all possible, but a key step (nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone) has poor regioselectivity for the desired product, contradicting the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question where one answer must be correct, it's possible there is an error in the question itself. The most logical and effective synthesis is Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. Option B follows the sequence Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. It is the only option that starts with the correct first step and attempts to add the correct groups via electrophilic substitution, albeit in the wrong order for high yield. Given the catastrophic failures in the other options (reactions that do not proceed at all), Option B, despite its own flaw regarding yield, might be considered the \"best\" or intended answer, assuming a typo in the order of steps ii and iii. If we swap steps ii and iii in option B, we get the correct synthesis. No other option can be fixed so simply to yield a correct pathway.\n\nLet's re-examine Option B's steps: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2. Steps iv-vii seem extraneous and nonsensical after the target molecule would have been formed (in low yield) at step iii. This points to a poorly constructed question. However, if forced to choose, B's initial sequence of adding the three required functionalities is the most plausible starting point compared to the definite failures in other options.\n\nGiven the options, there appears to be an error in the question. However, if we must choose the most plausible sequence despite its flaws, B is the only one where the sequence of additions is conceptually close to a viable route, differing only by the order of the last two substitutions.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option B and the correct sequence is i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Br2/FeBr3. This corrected sequence is the most efficient and logical route. Therefore, B is the most likely intended answer, despite being written with an error.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The desired product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    The structure is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    Notice that all substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Consider the Properties of Substituents:**\n    We need to understand how each substituent affects subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions.\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    A crucial rule in organic synthesis is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**, such as those containing a nitro group (-NO2). This means the Friedel-Crafts acylation must be performed before the nitration step if both groups are on the ring, or on a ring that is not strongly deactivated.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Possible Synthetic Routes:**\n\n    *   **Can we add the acetyl group last?**\n        This would require performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This molecule has two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), with the nitro group being a strong deactivator. Therefore, the Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail. So, the acetyl group cannot be added last.\n\n    *   **The acetyl group must be added early.** This means the synthesis must start with the acylation of benzene.\n        **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n        Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n        This introduces the -COCH3 group, which is a *meta*-director.\n\n    *   **Now, what's the next step? Nitration or Bromination?**\n\n        *   **Path 1: Nitration first, then Bromination.**\n            *   **Step 2a: Nitration.** Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group directs the -NO2 group to the *meta* position).\n            *   **Step 3a: Bromination.** Now we brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring has two *meta*-directing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5. This reaction is regioselective and would yield the desired product. However, the ring is very strongly deactivated by two deactivating groups, so this reaction would be very slow and require harsh conditions.\n\n        *   **Path 2: Bromination first, then Nitration.**\n            *   **Step 2b: Bromination.** Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group directs the -Br group to the *meta* position).\n            *   **Step 3b: Nitration.** Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br).\n                *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n                *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n                *   Although the directing effects are conflicting, the position that is least deactivated will be substituted. Position 5 is *meta* to both groups. Positions 2, 4, and 6 are all *ortho* or *para* to one deactivating group. It has been experimentally shown that nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone gives the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in high yield. The deactivation of the ring is less severe than in Path 1 (since -Br is less deactivating than -NO2), making this reaction more feasible.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on the best pathway:** The sequence **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration** is a very effective and high-yield route to the target molecule.\n\n4.  **Match the Pathway with the Given Options:**\n    Let's look for the sequence: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3, ii) Br2/FeBr3, iii) HNO3/H2SO4.\n\n    *   **A)** Starts with nitration. Incorrect.\n    *   **B)** **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4** ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2.\n        The first three steps of this option perfectly match our derived optimal synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical if applied after the formation of the product and are likely included as distractors. The question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, which the first three steps of B accomplish with high yield.\n    *   **C)** Starts with bromination, leading to *o,p* substitution in the next step, which is not what we want. Friedel-Crafts also fails in step iii. Incorrect.\n    *   **D)** Starts with nitration, and the proposed acylation in step (iii) on aniline is problematic and leads to incorrect isomers upon bromination. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option that presents a viable, high-yield synthetic route at the beginning of its sequence is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a meta-meta relationship.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the existing substituents on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating and an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Key Constraints in Synthesis**\n\nA crucial rule in aromatic synthesis is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (acylation and alkylation) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**. Rings with substituents like -NO2, -SO3H, or -NR3+ are too deactivated for the reaction to proceed. This is a major constraint we must consider when evaluating the reaction sequences.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence step-by-step.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n    1.  **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.** The ring now has a strongly deactivating -NO2 group.\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.** The -NO2 group is reduced to an -NH2 group. Aniline is strongly activated.\n    3.  **Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Reaction Fails.** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempt on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3). This complex is extremely deactivating, preventing the acylation reaction on the ring. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...\n    1.  This sequence starts by nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, diazotizing it, and then removing the diazonium group with H3PO2.\n    2.  Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n    3.  These first four steps simply return the starting material, benzene. This is a nonsensical and inefficient pathway. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n    1.  **Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.** The ring has an ortho-, para-directing -Br group.\n    2.  **Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product) + o-Bromonitrobenzene.** The target molecule requires a meta relationship between the bromo and nitro groups. This step produces para and ortho isomers, not the required meta isomer.\n    3.  Even if we proceed, the next step is Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene. This ring has two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), making it strongly deactivated. The Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail.\n    Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This Friedel-Crafts acylation is performed on an activated benzene ring and works well. The product, acetophenone, has an acetyl group (-COCH3), which is a **meta-director**.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to the meta position (position 3). This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now we nitrate the ring which has two substituents:\n        *   The **-COCH3 group at position 1** is a **meta-director**, directing the new group to position 5.\n        *   The **-Br group at position 3** is an **ortho-, para-director**, directing the new group to positions 2, 4, and 5.\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This is a case of reinforcing directing effects, which leads to a clean reaction with a high yield of the desired product. The resulting molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence is chemically sound and is the most logical way to synthesize the target molecule with high yield and selectivity among the choices. The subsequent steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are unnecessary and would chemically alter the desired product into something else, suggesting a possible flaw in the question's construction. However, the initial sequence is the only viable path presented.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only sequence that correctly applies the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution to produce the desired 1,3,5-substituted product is the one starting with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration. This corresponds to the beginning of Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   The substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The numbering indicates that if the acetyl group is at position 1, the bromo group is at position 3, and the nitro group is at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A meta-director and strongly deactivating.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** An ortho,para-director and weakly deactivating.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A meta-director and strongly deactivating.\n\n**3. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the order of reactions is crucial. We must consider the directing effects at each step.\n\nA critical constraint is the Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the -COCH3 group). This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. Therefore, the acylation step must be performed before nitration, or on a ring that is not strongly deactivated.\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this understanding.\n\n**Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Reduction gives aniline.\n*   iii) Diazotization gives a diazonium salt.\n*   iv) Deamination (reaction with H3PO2) removes the diazonium group, regenerating benzene. Steps i-iv are a long and pointless synthesis of benzene from benzene.\n*   Even if we ignore the first four steps and start from step v) with benzene -> bromobenzene.\n*   vi) Acylation of bromobenzene. The -Br group is an o,p-director, so this would yield a mixture of 2-bromoacetophenone and 4-bromoacetophenone, not the desired 3-bromo isomer.\n*   Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is Friedel-Crafts acylation. The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing the acylation reaction. The sequence is chemically flawed.\n*   Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4. The -Br group is an o,p-director, yielding a mixture of 2-bromonitrobenzene and 4-bromonitrobenzene. Neither has the required meta relationship.\n*   iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 on bromonitrobenzene. The ring is deactivated by both a bromo and a nitro group. Friedel-Crafts acylation under these conditions is not feasible.\n*   Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nLet's analyze the first three steps, which represent a complete synthesis pathway.\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The resulting acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This step is correct.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** At this stage, the ring has an acetyl group at C1 (meta-director, strong deactivator) and a bromo group at C3 (o,p-director, weak deactivator).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   The directing effects are conflicting. However, the position meta to the strongly deactivating group (C5) is the least deactivated position on the ring and is the major site of substitution. Thus, nitration occurs at C5 to yield the desired product.\n\nThis three-step sequence (i, ii, iii) successfully produces the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical as they would modify the already-formed product into something else. In the context of a multiple-choice question, it's common for incorrect options to be entirely wrong, while the correct option contains the right core sequence, even with extraneous or erroneous later steps. The initial sequence in Option D is the only chemically viable route among the choices provided to synthesize the target compound with high yield and correct regiochemistry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1.

Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Weakly deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that we should introduce the substituents in an order that utilizes *meta*-directing effects.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n**Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction introduces the acetyl group, forming acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *Product: Acetophenone*\n\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination):** The acetyl group on the ring directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position.\n    *Product: 3-Bromoacetophenone*\n\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** We now have two groups on the ring: -COCH₃ (at C1) and -Br (at C3). We need to determine where the nitro group will go.\n    *   The -COCH₃ group is a strong deactivator and directs *meta* (to C5).\n    *   The -Br group is a weak deactivator and directs *ortho, para* (to C2, C4, C6).\n    *   The acetyl group strongly deactivates its ortho and para positions (C2, C4, C6). The bromine atom also deactivates the ring but directs incoming groups to these same positions. The position least deactivated is C5, which is meta to both existing substituents. Therefore, the powerful meta-directing and deactivating acetyl group will primarily direct the incoming nitro group to position C5.\n    *Product: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.* This is the target molecule.\n\nThe first three steps of this sequence successfully synthesize the desired product with high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical for this synthesis and appear to be extraneous. However, the initial part of the sequence is the most logical and correct pathway among all choices.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Nitration:** Forms nitrobenzene (-NO₂ is a *meta*-director).\n*   **Step ii) Reduction:** Forms aniline (-NH₂ is an *ortho, para*-director).\n*   **Step iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails on anilines because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a strongly deactivated anilinium complex. This path is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n\n*   **Steps i-iv:** This sequence is Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene. These steps form a futile cycle, returning to the starting material (benzene) before any of the target substituents are correctly placed. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Bromination:** Forms bromobenzene (-Br is an *ortho, para*-director).\n*   **Step ii) Nitration:** The -Br group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to the *ortho* and *para* positions. This produces a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. It does not produce the required 1-bromo-3-nitro- substitution pattern needed for the final product. This path is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence A provides a chemically sound and logical pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, specifically in its first three steps. The other options fail due to incorrect directing effects or chemically incompatible reactions. Despite the presence of superfluous and incorrect later steps, Option A is the only choice containing the correct synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis should prioritize introducing substituents under the influence of *meta*-directors. The presence of the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group needs careful strategic placement.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A-D)**\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step:\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (-NH2)\n    *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction **fails**. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring towards acylation. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene (Deamination reaction).\n    *   This sequence of reactions starts with benzene and returns to benzene after four steps, making it a pointless and inefficient pathway. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration): The bromo group is *ortho, para*-directing. This reaction would yield a mixture of *o*-bromonitrobenzene and *p*-bromonitrobenzene as the major products. It would not form the *meta* isomer needed to build the 1,3,5 pattern. Thus, Option C starts with an incorrect regiochemical step and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...\n    *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This produces **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This produces **1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one** (or m-bromoacetophenone). This step correctly sets up the 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **iii) 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Now we have two groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1, strong deactivator, *meta*-directing) and -Br (at C3, weak deactivator, *o,p*-directing).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        *   In cases of competing directors, the directing effect of the strongest deactivating group often dominates the regiochemistry, or the substitution occurs at a position that is electronically and sterically favorable. Position 5 is meta to both existing groups and is sterically accessible. Synthetically, this reaction is known to produce **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\nThe first three steps of Option D provide a chemically sound and direct route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv, v, vi, vii) are superfluous and would lead to a different product if carried out. However, among the given choices, Option D is the only one that contains a valid synthetic pathway to the desired product. It is common in such questions for the correct option to be the one whose initial sequence is correct.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in option D is the most plausible route.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the ring are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The key feature is the substitution pattern: all three groups are *meta* to each other (1,3,5 substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing groups on the benzene ring direct new groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. (Relevant for intermediates in some options).\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it can logically produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **Sequence A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene:** Nitration of benzene. The -NO2 group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene -> Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group (-NH2). The -NH2 group is strongly activating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n    3.  **Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This step is highly problematic. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings with strongly activating groups like -NH2. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivating complex (-N+H2-AlCl3), which prevents the desired reaction on the ring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence B:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Bromobenzene:** Bromination of benzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  **Bromobenzene -> o/p-Bromonitrobenzene:** Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with the para isomer (4-bromonitrobenzene) being the major one. This does not lead to a *meta* relationship between Br and NO2.\n    3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts acylation on this ring is very difficult because it is strongly deactivated by both the -Br and -NO2 groups. Even if it worked, the directing effects would not lead to the 1,3,5 pattern. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene**\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene -> Aniline**\n    3.  **Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride:** Diazotization of aniline.\n    4.  **Benzenediazonium chloride -> Benzene:** Reduction of the diazonium salt with H3PO2 removes the group entirely, regenerating the starting material, benzene. This sequence is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Sequence D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product is acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is an electrophilic bromination. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine atom is added at the meta position (position 3). This step is correct.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is an electrophilic nitration on 3-bromoacetophenone. We must consider the directing effects of both substituents:\n        *   The -COCH3 group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, directing the new -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group at position 3 is an *ortho, para*-director, directing the new group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        At first glance, the directors seem to conflict. However, the -COCH3 group is a strong deactivator, making the positions *ortho* and *para* to it (positions 2, 4, 6) very unreactive. The least deactivated position on the ring is position 5 (meta to the strong deactivator). Therefore, the nitration occurs preferentially at position 5, yielding the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This reaction is known to proceed with a good yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence D provide a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are superfluous and would modify the desired product if carried out, but the question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the product. This implies that the correct path is contained within the option.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence D correctly outlines the steps to first install a *meta*-director (acetyl group), then use it to direct the second substituent (bromo group) to the meta position, and finally, perform a third substitution (nitration) which is directed to the only remaining favorable position to give the 1,3,5-trisubstituted product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key structural feature is that all three substituents are **meta** (in a 1,3,5 relationship) to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent influences the position of subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitutions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Deactivating (strongly) and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nSynthesizing a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring is challenging, especially when one of the substituents is an ortho, para-director (-Br) and the other two are meta-directors (-COCH3, -NO2). A direct sequence of electrophilic substitutions is unlikely to work efficiently.\n*   If we try to add the three groups directly, their directing effects will conflict. For example, if we have a 1,3-disubstituted ring with a meta-director and an o,p-director, the third substituent will likely lead to a mixture of products.\n*   Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH3 group) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. This means the acylation step must happen before nitration, or an alternative strategy is needed.\n\nThe presence of steps like reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a more sophisticated strategy involving the use of a temporary amino group (-NH2) to control the regiochemistry. The amino group can be introduced by reducing a nitro group, and it can be removed completely after it has served its directing purpose.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace each proposed reaction sequence.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\nii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → A mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene.\niii) Product from (ii) + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a nitro-substituted benzene ring. The reaction is extremely slow or fails due to the strong deactivating effect of the nitro group. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\nii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\niii) Aniline → Diazonium salt\niv) Diazonium salt → Benzene (deamination). This sequence just regenerates the starting material, benzene, and then proceeds with further reactions on it, which is nonsensical. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\niii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. If it were to proceed, it would likely yield the meta product (3-aminoacetophenone), but it's not a standard, high-yield reaction. Assuming it works and gives 3-aminoacetophenone:\niv) 3-aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → The powerful activating -NH2 group directs ortho/para. Under acidic conditions (FeBr3 is a Lewis acid), the amine is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The -COCH3 group is also a meta-director. Starting with substituents at C1 and C3, both direct to C5. So we would get 3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone.\nv) Nitration of 3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has three substituents: -NH3+ (meta), -Br (o,p), and -COCH3 (meta). The ring is extremely deactivated by two strong deactivators (-NH3+, -COCH3) making this nitration step very difficult, if not impossible. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option A:**\nThis sequence employs the strategy of using a temporary group to control regiochemistry.\ni) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **Acetophenone**. (This adds the acetyl group early, avoiding issues with Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring).\nii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. (The acetyl group is a meta-director, so this step is regioselective).\niii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitration**. Here, the directing effects conflict (-COCH3 is meta, -Br is o,p). This will produce a mixture of isomers, primarily 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone. Crucially, the synthesis does not require this step to be selective. Let's call the product mixture **Isomer Mix**.\niv) Isomer Mix + Fe/HCl → **Reduction**. The nitro group in all isomers is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). We now have a mixture of 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone and 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone. Let's call this **Amino Mix**.\nv) Amino Mix + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Second Nitration**. This is the key step.\n    *   In 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful activating -NH2 group (at C4) and the meta-directing -COCH3 group (at C1) both strongly direct the incoming -NO2 group to **position 5**.\n    *   In 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful activating -NH2 group (at C6) and the meta-directing -COCH3 group (at C1) both strongly direct the incoming -NO2 group to **position 5**.\n    This step is highly regioselective for both components of the mixture, yielding a mix of 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone and 6-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. The desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern is now established.\nvi) Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → **Diazotization**. The amino group (-NH2) in both isomers is converted to a diazonium salt group (-N2+).\nvii) Product from (vi) + H3PO2 → **Deamination**. The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Removing the group at C4 from the first isomer leaves substituents at C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   Removing the group at C6 from the second isomer also leaves substituents at C1, C3, and C5.\n    Both paths converge to the same final product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis synthetic route is elegant because it doesn't rely on a difficult separation or a selective reaction in step (iii). Instead, it uses the initial nitro group as a \"sacrificial\" directing group that is later removed, ensuring a high overall yield of the final target molecule.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in Option A is the correct and most effective pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   There are three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents direct new ones to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Analyze Key Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (adding -COCH3):** This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings. A ring with a -NO2 group is too deactivated. It also does not work on rings with an -NH2 group (aniline) because the amine is a Lewis base that reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst.\n*   **1,3,5-Substitution:** To achieve this pattern, we generally need to use *meta*-directing groups to guide the substitutions, or use a \"placeholder\" group that can be modified or removed later (e.g., via a Sandmeyer reaction sequence).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is attached to the ring. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is an electrophilic bromination. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This successfully creates a 1,3 substitution pattern.\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is nitration. We now have two groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1, a *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, an *ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Although the directing effects are conflicting, the position meta to both groups (C5) is the least deactivated overall. The reaction is known to proceed with good yield to form the 1,3,5-substituted product. **At this point, the target molecule has been synthesized.**\n*   The remaining steps (iv-vii) seem extraneous and chemically flawed (e.g., nitrating a sensitive aniline derivative), but the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target product.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **Step iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride**\n*   **Step iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene:** This sequence of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) results in converting benzene back into benzene. This pathway is nonsensical.\n\n**Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product):** The -Br group is *ortho, para*-directing, with the *para* product favored.\n*   **Step iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group. **This reaction will fail.** Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **Step iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempted on aniline. The lone pair of the -NH2 group (a Lewis base) will react with the AlCl3 catalyst (a Lewis acid), deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. **This reaction will fail.** Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A contains a chemically sound and logical pathway to the target molecule. The sequence of acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to build the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The first three steps of Option A represent the most effective synthesis among the choices. The superfluous steps at the end are likely an error in the question's formulation, but they do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1.

Understand the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nThe order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring is crucial, as each group directs the next incoming group to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director** due to its lone pairs participating in resonance.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nWe need to find a sequence that logically leads to the 1,3,5 substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromobenzene. The bromo group is an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Step ii):** Bromobenzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → This will produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major). Neither of these has the required meta-relationship for building the final product. This pathway will not lead to a high yield of the target.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta-director.\n*   **Step ii):** Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline. This reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH₂), which is a strong activating group and an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Step iii):** Aniline + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts acylation) → This reaction does not work as intended. The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex. This complex deactivates the ring so strongly that the Friedel-Crafts acylation of the ring fails.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect due to a fundamentally flawed step.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii):** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   **Step iii):** Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization).\n*   **Step iv):** Benzenediazonium chloride + H₃PO₂ → Benzene (deamination).\n*   This sequence of reactions converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. It is a pointless loop and does not lead to the desired product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone. This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a meta-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **Step ii):** Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine will be directed to the meta position (C3). This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   **Step iii):** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration. Now we must place the nitro group.\n    *   The ring has two substituents: -COCH₃ (at C1, meta-director) and -Br (at C3, ortho, para-director).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The directing effects are in conflict. However, in such cases, we must also consider steric hindrance and the relative deactivating strengths. The positions ortho to the substituents (2 and ortho-part of 6) are sterically hindered. A detailed analysis shows that the least disfavored position is C5. Therefore, nitration occurs at position 5, yielding **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, the desired product. This pathway is known to produce the target compound as the major product.\n*   **Steps iv) to vii):** These subsequent steps (reduction, nitration, diazotization, deamination) would modify and ultimately destroy the target molecule that was already successfully synthesized in step iii. These steps appear to be extraneous and are likely an error in the question's formatting. However, the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence D provides a viable synthetic route to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in its initial steps. The other options fail due to incorrect directing effects or incompatible reactions. Despite the superfluous final steps listed in option D, it is the only choice that correctly describes how to build the molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Parent:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Structure and Directing Effects:**\n    *   The substituents are all in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n    *   -COCH3 is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   -NO2 is a strong deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   -Br is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider adding the three groups directly to benzene.\n*   **Problem:** It's very difficult to add three groups in a 1,3,5-pattern when they don't all direct to the same places. More importantly, Friedel-Crafts reactions, like the acylation needed to add the -COCH3 group (CH3COCl/AlCl3), fail on strongly deactivated rings. If we add the -NO2 and -Br groups first, the ring becomes too deactivated for the final acylation step.\n*   **Route 1:** Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. (OK)\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group is a meta-director, so this works well).\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → Target. (The -COCH3 and -NO2 groups are both meta-directors. They both direct the incoming Br+ to position 5. The regiochemistry is perfect).\n*   **Potential Flaw:** The final bromination step is performed on a ring with two deactivating groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). This makes the ring very unreactive towards electrophilic substitution. While the selectivity is good, the reaction rate is very low, and standard conditions (Br2/FeBr3) give very poor yields (reported as ~11%). Achieving a \"high-yield\" requires very harsh, specific conditions not implied by the question's reagents. Therefore, this simple route is likely not the intended answer for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate Indirect Synthesis Routes (The \"Amino Group\" Strategy)**\n\nThe presence of reagents for reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a more sophisticated strategy. This strategy involves:\n1.  Introducing an amino group (-NH2), usually from a nitro group.\n2.  Using the powerful ortho, para-directing effect of the amino group (or its protected form, acetamido -NHCOCH3) to place other substituents.\n3.  Removing the amino group via diazotization and deamination.\n\nThis is a classic method for synthesizing substitution patterns that are otherwise inaccessible.\n\n**4. Analyze the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace each option to see if it follows a logical path to the target.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    *   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 is a meta-director).\n    *   iii) Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone. Here, -COCH3 directs to position 5, but -Br (an o,p-director) directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The directors are in conflict, which will lead to a mixture of products, not a high-yield synthesis of the desired isomer. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n    *   This sequence just returns to the starting material, benzene. This is a pointless loop. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n    *   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of p-Bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both -Br and -NO2 groups. This reaction fails. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's see if we can find a plausible (though complex) path that matches these reagents. The overall strategy must be the amino-group-directed synthesis. A successful, high-yield synthesis is as follows:\n    1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline.** (Matches steps **i** and **ii**).\n    2.  **Aniline → p-Aminoacetophenone.** This is a complex transformation. A possible way is protecting the aniline as acetanilide, performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation (which gives the para product), and then deprotecting. Let's assume the single step **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3** is a shorthand for this entire process of getting the acetyl group onto the ring para to the amino group. The product is 4-aminoacetophenone.\n    3.  **4-aminoacetophenone → 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone.** This is step **iv) Br2/FeBr3**. The directing effects are checked: The strong o,p-directing -NH2 group and the m-directing -COCH3 group both direct bromination to position 3. This is a reinforcing effect and works well.\n    4.  **4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.** This is step **v) HNO3/H2SO4**. For this to work in high yield, the powerful -NH2 group must direct the nitration to position 5 (ortho to itself). This requires non-acidic conditions to avoid protonating the amine to the meta-directing -NH3+. Assuming such conditions are implied, this step is plausible.\n    5.  **4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazotize the -NH2 group.** This is step **vi) NaNO2/HCl**. This is the standard reaction.\n    6.  **Diazonium salt → Deamination (remove the N2+ group).** This is step **vii) H3PO2**. Removing the directing group at position 4 leaves the acetyl group at C1, the bromo group at C3, and the nitro group at C5. This yields the target product.\n\n    While the description of steps (iii) and (v) in option A is imprecise, the overall sequence of transformations represents a valid and high-yield synthetic strategy for this challenging target molecule. The other options contain fundamental flaws (failed reactions, incorrect regiochemistry, pointless loops). Therefore, Option A is the best choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   Bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   Nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions:\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n### 3. Key Chemical Principles to Consider\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (and Alkylation):** These reactions (like adding the -COCH₃ group) do not work on strongly deactivated rings, particularly those bearing a nitro group (-NO₂). This is a critical constraint.\n*   **Order of Reactions:** The order in which substituents are introduced is crucial for achieving the correct isomer.\n*   **Conflicting Directing Effects:** When multiple substituents are present, their directing effects must be considered together. Often, the most strongly activating group dominates, or in the case of multiple deactivating groups, the reaction occurs at the least deactivated position.\n*   **Diazotization-Deamination Sequence:** A sequence involving reduction of a nitro group to an amine (e.g., with Fe/HCl), followed by diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) and deamination (H₃PO₂), is used to remove an amino group. This is often employed as a strategy to overcome unfavorable directing effects by using the amino group as a temporary \"phantom\" director. However, in this case, the final product contains all meta-directing groups (or an o,p-director meta to the others), so such a complex route may not be the most straightforward.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride.\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (Deamination).\nThis sequence brings the starting material back to benzene after four steps, making the entire sequence illogical for synthesizing a complex product. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene. (-Br is o,p-director).\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product). The ring now has a -Br and a -NO₂ group.\n*   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).\nThis step is the fatal flaw. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, and Friedel-Crafts acylation will not proceed under normal conditions. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ...**\nLet's trace this path carefully.\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → This reaction would primarily result in N-acylation to form acetanilide, not a Friedel-Crafts reaction on the ring. The basic nitrogen atom complexes with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring.\n*   If we assume acetanilide is formed, step (iv) would be bromination to yield p-bromoacetanilide. Following the entire sequence (which includes nitration and a missing hydrolysis step before diazotization/deamination) leads to 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which is not the target molecule. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\nLet's analyze the sequence of reactions:\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product, acetophenone, has a meta-directing acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This is a standard electrophilic bromination on a moderately deactivated ring.\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n    *   In 3-bromoacetophenone, we have a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an o,p-director (-Br at C3).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   However, the acetyl group is a stronger deactivator than the bromo group. It strongly deactivates its ortho and para positions (2, 4, 6). Therefore, the electrophilic attack is most likely to occur at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl group and least deactivated.\n    *   This reaction is known to produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in high yield.\n\nThe first three steps of option B constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) would modify the product and seem superfluous, likely an error in the question's formulation. However, compared to the other options which contain fundamental chemical errors (impossible reactions, wrong products, illogical sequences), the core synthesis presented in option B is correct. Therefore, it is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThis problem asks for the best sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene in high yield.\n\nLet's first analyze the target molecule. The structure is:\n```\n      COCH3\n      /\n    (C1)\n   /   \\\n(C6)   (C2)\n|       |\n(C5)---(C4)---(C3)\n \\     /\n  NO2 Br\n```\nThe substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This is a meta, meta substitution pattern.\n\nWe need to evaluate the directing effects of these substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and a meta-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly electron-withdrawing, strongly deactivating, and a meta-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Electron-withdrawing by induction but electron-donating by resonance, overall weakly deactivating, and an ortho, para-director.\n\nA critical rule for synthesis is that Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) do not work on strongly deactivated benzene rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. They also fail with amines like aniline because the amine's lone pair coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3).\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction)\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization)\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination)\nThe first four steps start with benzene and return to benzene, which is an inefficient and pointless sequence. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene. (-Br is an o,p-director).\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → A mixture of p-bromonitrobenzene (major) and o-bromonitrobenzene (minor).\n*   iii) Now, we attempt a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on bromonitrobenzene. The presence of the strongly deactivating nitro group (-NO2) on the ring prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction from occurring. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Now, we attempt a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction fails because the nitrogen atom of the amino group acts as a Lewis base and coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a strongly deactivating ammonium salt (-NH2+-AlCl3), which shuts down the electrophilic substitution on the ring. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\nLet's analyze the sequence of reactions step-by-step.\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.**\n    This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product is acetophenone, which has an acetyl group (-COCH3) on the ring. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n    The acetyl group directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. This gives 3-bromoacetophenone. Now we have an acetyl group at C1 and a bromo group at C3.\n\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n    This is the crucial step. We are nitrating a ring with two substituents: -COCH3 (meta-director) at C1 and -Br (ortho,para-director) at C3.\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C5.\n    *   The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n    At first glance, the directing effects seem to conflict. However, we must analyze the stability of the intermediate sigma complex (Wheland intermediate) for substitution at each possible position.\n    *   **Substitution at C5:** The positive charge in the intermediate is delocalized over C2, C4, and C6. None of these positions force the positive charge onto C1 or C3, which bear the electron-withdrawing groups. In fact, the resonance (+M) effect of the bromine atom can help stabilize the positive charge when it's at C2, C4, and C6. This is a favorable pathway.\n    *   **Substitution at any other position (C2, C4, or C6):** The formation of the sigma complex would involve resonance structures where the positive charge is placed directly on C1, the carbon atom attached to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group. Such a structure is extremely high in energy and strongly disfavored.\n    Therefore, substitution occurs almost exclusively at C5, leading to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, in high yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence B provide a valid, high-yield route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are extraneous and would modify the product if carried out, suggesting a possible flaw in the question's construction. However, among the given choices, option B is the only one that contains a chemically sound and high-yield synthetic pathway to the target molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent is benzene.\n*   The substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. This means all three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, ortho,para-directing.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-directing. Can be converted to a meta-directing -NH3+ group in strong acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate the General Strategy**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern is crucial.\n*   A simple approach would be to install two meta-directing groups, which would then direct a third substituent to the position between them (position 5). For example, brominating 3-nitroacetophenone. Both -COCH3 and -NO2 are meta-directors and would direct Br to the 5-position. However, the ring would be extremely deactivated, making the reaction very difficult and likely low-yield.\n*   A more sophisticated strategy, often required for complex substitution patterns, is to use a \"placeholder\" directing group (like -NH2) that can be modified or removed later. The presence of diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and deamination (H3PO2) reagents in the options strongly suggests such a strategy is intended. The sequence Ar-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Ar-N2+ --(H3PO2)--> Ar-H removes an amino group.\n\n**4. Analyze Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) Nitration -> Nitrobenzene. ii) Reduction -> Aniline. iii) Acylation of Amine -> Acetanilide. iv) Bromination -> p-Bromoacetanilide. v) Nitration -> 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide. vi) Hydrolysis (implicit) and Diazotization -> 4-bromo-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt. vii) Deamination -> **1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene**. This is not the target molecule as it lacks the acetyl group.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) Nitration -> Nitrobenzene. ii) Reduction -> Aniline. iii) Diazotization -> Benzenediazonium chloride. iv) Deamination -> **Benzene**. This sequence is a pointless loop that returns to the starting material.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) Bromination -> Bromobenzene. ii) Nitration -> p-Bromonitrobenzene. iii) Acylation (Friedel-Crafts) -> This reaction is very difficult on a ring deactivated by both -Br and -NO2. Assuming it works and gives the reinforced product (2-acetyl-4-bromonitrobenzene, i.e., 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone), the next step is (iv) Nitration. Nitrating a ring with three deactivating groups is extremely difficult. If we follow the whole sequence, it leads to **3-bromoacetophenone**, not the target.\n\n*   **Option D:** Let's trace this path carefully.\n    i) **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone.**\n       (-COCH3 is a meta-director).\n    ii) **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n       (Acylation is followed by bromination, which is directed to the meta position).\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Intermediate.**\n       Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone gives a mixture of isomers. For this synthetic route to be viable, we need to form an isomer that can lead to the final product. Let's assume we form and isolate **3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**. (This isomer results from ortho-direction by the bromo group).\n    iv) **3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl -> 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone.**\n       (The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amino group).\n    v) **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.**\n       This is a critical step. We are nitrating an aniline derivative. The amino group (-NH2) is a very strong ortho,para-director and will control the substitution. Its ortho position is C5 and its para position (C1) is blocked. The acetyl group (-COCH3) also directs meta to C5. Therefore, nitration occurs regioselectively at C5. While aniline nitration can be complex in strong acid, the directing effects strongly favor the required C5 isomer.\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl -> ...diazonium salt.**\n       (The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt).\n    vii) **...diazonium salt + H3PO2 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n       (The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination). Removing the group at C4 leaves the acetyl group at C1, the bromo group at C3, and the nitro group at C5).\n\nThis sequence successfully constructs the target molecule with the correct 1,3,5-substitution pattern. It cleverly uses an amino group as a director, which is later removed to achieve a substitution pattern that would be difficult to obtain by direct electrophilic substitution alone.\n\nTherefore, sequence D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. This involves planning a multi-step synthesis, paying close attention to the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe key to designing the synthesis is to introduce the groups in an order that utilizes their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern. Since all groups are *meta* to each other, a good strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-director, and then add the other substituents.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Step ii: Bromobenzene → Nitration. The -NO2 group will be directed to the *ortho* and *para* positions. The major product is p-bromonitrobenzene (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene). This 1,4-substitution pattern is incorrect for building a 1,3,5-substituted product. This sequence will not lead to the desired product in high yield.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction).\n*   Step iii & iv: Aniline → Diazonium salt → Benzene (deamination).\n*   This sequence converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene. It does not lead to the target molecule. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   Step iii: Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction fails. The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents the acylation reaction. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\nLet's analyze the crucial first three steps:\n*   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group (-COCH3). This is an excellent first step because the acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n*   **Step ii: Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** This is an electrophilic bromination. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (C3), giving the desired 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** This is an electrophilic nitration. We now have two groups on the ring: -COCH3 at C1 (*meta*-director) and -Br at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   In cases of conflicting directors, we analyze the positions. Position C5 is meta to the strong deactivating -COCH3 group. Positions C4 and C6 are ortho/para to the -Br group. While a mixture might be expected, the directing effect of the acetyl group is strong, and nitration at C5 is the major pathway, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This route correctly installs all three substituents with the correct 1,3,5-regiochemistry.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) in option B appear to be nonsensical and would not be performed after the target molecule has already been synthesized in step iii. They are likely included as distractors or are an error in the question. However, the initial sequence of reactions (i, ii, iii) is the only chemically sound and high-yield pathway to the target molecule among the choices.\n\nTherefore, the sequence beginning with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration is the correct approach.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a derivative of benzene.\n*   It has three substituents on the ring.\n*   The parent structure is ethan-1-one attached to a phenyl group, which is acetophenone. The acetyl group (`-COCH3`) is at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (`-Br`) is at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (`-NO2`) is at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are **meta** (1,3,5) relative to each other. This substitution pattern is key to devising the synthesis, as it depends heavily on the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider the directing effects of the groups we will introduce or have as intermediates:\n*   **Acetyl group (`-COCH3`):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (`-Br`):** Weakly deactivating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (`-NO2`):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (`-NH2`):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director** (often appears as an intermediate).\n\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-trisubstituted product, the directing effects of the groups on the ring must align correctly during the substitution steps. The best strategy is often to introduce groups that direct an incoming substituent to the desired position.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways (The Options)**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction)\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization)\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination with H3PO2)\nThis sequence of the first four steps converts benzene back into benzene, which makes no sense for a synthesis. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline + `CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction does not work. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a strongly deactivated complex (`-NH2+-AlCl3`) that prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction. If N-acylation (amide formation) were intended, it would lead to acetanilide, which upon bromination and nitration yields 1,2,4-substituted products, not the desired 1,3,5 pattern. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n*   ii) Bromobenzene + `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration): The bromo group is an o,p-director, so this step yields a mixture of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major) and 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (minor).\n*   iii) `1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene` + `CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction fails. The benzene ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, preventing Friedel-Crafts acylation. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nLet's analyze this sequence.\n*   **i) Benzene + `CH3COCl/AlCl3` → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation and works well. The product has an acetyl group (`-COCH3`), which is a meta-director.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + `Br2/FeBr3` → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. This reaction provides the desired 1,3-disubstituted product.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + `HNO3/H2SO4` → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents:\n    *   `-COCH3` (at C1) is a meta-director, directing the nitro group to position 5.\n    *   `-Br` (at C3) is an o,p-director, directing the nitro group to positions 2, 4, 6 (relative to the acetyl group).\n    While the directing effects conflict, nitration at position 5 is a significant outcome. Experimental evidence confirms that 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one is the major product of this reaction, which can be isolated in reasonable yield (e.g., ~60%) after recrystallization. This sequence of the first three steps successfully generates the target molecule.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) in option D seem chemically nonsensical for synthesizing the target. They appear to take the desired product, reduce the nitro group (iv), attempt another nitration (v), and then perform a diazotization-deamination sequence (vi, vii). This would destroy the product. It is highly likely that these steps are erroneously included in the option. However, compared to options A, B, and C which fail on fundamental principles (non-working reactions or incorrect regiochemistry), the initial sequence of D is the only viable path presented that leads to the target molecule. In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"best\" option, which is the one that contains a valid synthetic route, even if it has extraneous or incorrect parts.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy elimination and analysis of the initial, critical steps, option D provides the only plausible route to the desired product among the choices. The first three steps constitute a known, if not perfectly high-yield, synthesis. The other options are fundamentally flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means all substituents are **meta** to each other.\n\n### 2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nThe order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring is critical. This is governed by the directing effects of the substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) reactions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Important Reaction Rule:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) do not work on strongly deactivated rings, especially those containing a nitro group (-NO₂). This means the **acylation step must be performed before the nitration step**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option based on these principles.\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n*   i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n*   iii) Diazotization of aniline gives benzenediazonium chloride.\n*   iv) Reaction with H₃PO₂ reduces the diazonium salt, removing the group entirely and regenerating benzene. This sequence makes no sense as it brings you back to the starting material. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n*   i) Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene. The -Br group is an o,p-director.\n*   ii) Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (ortho) and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (para), with the para product being major. Neither has the 1,3-relationship needed.\n*   iii) Acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene would be the next step. This Friedel-Crafts reaction will **fail** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n*   i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   iii) The next EAS step shown is Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) on a product derived from nitrobenzene. As established, FC acylation fails on nitrobenzene. This option is incorrect from the start. (Even if we consider the intermediate steps of reduction to aniline, the pathway does not lead to the desired product, as acylation would then occur on the amine or its complex with AlCl₃, leading to different isomers).\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...**\nLet's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n*   **i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction works well to produce **acetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a **meta-director**.\n     \n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br⁺) to the meta position. This correctly forms **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n     \n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** We now nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents:\n    *   -COCH₃ at C1 (meta-director, directs to C5).\n    *   -Br at C3 (ortho, para-director, directs to C2, C4, C6).\n    The acetyl group is a moderate deactivator, and its meta-directing effect to the open position (C5) is strong. The bromo group directs elsewhere. In this case, the directing effects combine favorably, and the major product is indeed **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, the desired target molecule, in high yield.\n     \n\nThe first three steps of this sequence provide a viable, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv-vii) in the option are extraneous and would modify the product in undesirable ways, but the core synthetic route presented at the beginning of this option is the correct one. Among the choices given, this is the only one that presents a chemically sound pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) is at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) is at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nWe need to consider the directing effects of each group in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), which is the primary way to add groups to a benzene ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃)**: Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂) C**: Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br)**: Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis likely relies on the presence of meta-directing groups to guide subsequent substitutions.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies\n\nLet's devise a logical synthesis based on these directing effects and then compare it with the given options. The key is the order in which the three groups are added.\n\n*   **Strategy A: Introduce the acetyl group first.**\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    2.  **Add the second group (e.g., Bromine):** Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position.\n    3.  **Add the third group (Nitro):** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's analyze the directing effects in this step:\n        *   The acetyl group at C1 is meta-directing, so it directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n        *   The bromo group at C3 is ortho,para-directing. It directs the incoming nitro group to positions C2, C4, and C6. The C5 position is *not* favored by bromine's directing effect. However, a position ortho to a halogen is often still reactive enough, and the combined influence is key. Let's consider another permutation.\n\n*   **Strategy B: Introduce acetyl, then nitro, then bromo.**\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs nitration to the meta position.\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n        *   The acetyl group at C1 is a meta-director, directing the incoming bromine to C5.\n        *   The nitro group at C3 is also a meta-director, directing the incoming bromine to C5.\n        *   Since both existing groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) to the same C5 position, this step should be highly regioselective and lead cleanly to the desired product. The only drawback is that the ring is heavily deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, so the reaction might be slow.\n\n*   **Strategy C (same as A, just swapping Br and NO2 addition order): Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n        *   The acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) directs nitration to C5.\n        *   The bromo group at C3 (ortho,para-director) directs to C2, C4, and C6. Position 5 is *ortho* to the bromine.\n        *   Here, both groups' directing effects align to favor position 5 (meta to acetyl, ortho to bromo). This is a strong indication that this pathway will give a high yield of the desired product.\n\nBoth strategies B and C seem chemically sound. Let's examine the options to see which one matches.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Given Options\n\nThe options provide a fixed sequence of 7 reactions. We need to find the one that correctly produces the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration); ii) Fe/HCl (Reduction); iii) NaNO₂/HCl (Diazotization); iv) H₃PO₂ (Deamination). This sequence (i to iv) converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a futile loop and cannot be correct.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    *   Step ii: Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. (Correct, as per Strategy C).\n    *   Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (TARGET!). (Correct, as per Strategy C).\n    This sequence of the first three steps is precisely Strategy C, which we identified as a high-yield route. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are nonsensical, as they would take the desired product and transform it into something else. However, compared to the other options, this is the only one that contains a valid synthesis for the target molecule. It is common in such questions that the correct sequence is embedded within a longer, sometimes flawed, list.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence begins by creating aniline, then acetanilide, then introduces bromine and a nitro group. Ultimately, it uses deamination to produce 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. It fails to introduce the acetyl group onto the ring (N-acylation for protection is not the same as C-acylation via Friedel-Crafts on the ring). So, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination); ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration). This would produce a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrobromobenzene, with the para isomer (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) being the major product. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on this product would occur ortho to the bromine and meta to the nitro group, i.e., at position 2. This would yield 1-(2-acetyl-4-nitrophenyl)bromine, which is the wrong isomer. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is the only choice that contains a chemically correct and high-yield pathway to the target molecule, even if the sequence listed is unnecessarily long. The first three steps of Option B represent the most logical synthesis: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1.  Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   The parent chain is ethan-1-one, which means there is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   This acetyl group is attached to a phenyl ring. The resulting molecule is acetophenone.\n*   The phenyl ring is substituted with a bromo group (-Br) at position 3 and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5, relative to the acetyl group at position 1.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      COCH3\n     /   \\\n    C     C\n   //    \\\\\n  C-NO2   C-Br\n   \\     //\n    C---C\n```\nThe three substituents (-COCH3, -Br, -NO2) are all meta to each other (in 1,3,5 positions).\n\n### 2.  Analyze the Substituent Directing Effects\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent directs the next incoming electrophile in an Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) reaction:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Weakly deactivating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Formed by reducing a nitro group (e.g., with Fe/HCl). It is strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**. When protonated in strong acid to -NH3+, it becomes strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\nA key rule for Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3) is that they **do not work** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a -NO2 group or an -NH2 group (which complexes with the AlCl3 catalyst).\n\n### 3.  Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. It correctly introduces the acetyl group. The product is acetophenone (C6H5COCH3). The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (position 3). This step is correct.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone:** We are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the new substituent to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    The directing groups are in conflict. However, the acetyl group is a very strong deactivator, especially for its ortho and para positions (2, 4, 6). The least deactivated position for an incoming electrophile is C5, which is meta to both existing groups. Therefore, nitration predominantly occurs at C5 to yield **3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**, which is the target molecule `1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`.\n\nThis sequence of the first three steps provides a high-yield synthesis of the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) would modify the product and are superfluous to its synthesis, but the initial sequence is chemically sound and successful.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt**\n*   **iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene:** This sequence of four steps just returns to the starting material, benzene. It is a futile loop and thus an incorrect synthetic pathway.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form a complex. This complex deactivates the ring so strongly that the Friedel-Crafts reaction does not proceed. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene**\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Bromonitrobenzene (major product):** Bromine is an ortho,para-director.\n*   **iii) 4-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring containing a nitro group. As mentioned earlier, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. The nitro group prevents this reaction from occurring. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n### 4.  Conclusion\n\n*   Options B, C, and D contain chemically unfeasible steps.\n*   Option A contains a correct and high-yield three-step synthesis to the target molecule. Although it lists extra, unnecessary steps, it is the only option that presents a valid pathway to the product. The question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, which the first part of sequence A accomplishes.\n\nTherefore, sequence A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position C1.\n    2.  A bromine atom (-Br) at position C3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2) at position C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means all three groups are meta to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution is crucial:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n\nThe goal is to introduce these three groups in an order that leverages their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Routes\n\nLet's consider the possible orders of introducing the three functional groups.\n\n*   **Ideal Route (Hypothetical):** The most logical sequence that takes advantage of directing effects would be one where a meta-director is used to place subsequent groups.\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Start by adding the acetyl group to benzene.\n        *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Nitrate acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group will direct the incoming nitro group to position 3.\n        *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.\n    3.  **Bromination:** Brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. Now, the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3). Both are **meta-directors**. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming bromine to C5. The -NO2 group also directs the incoming bromine to C5. This is a case of **concerted or reinforcing direction**, which should lead to a high yield of the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n    This ideal 3-step sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is chemically sound and expected to be high-yield. However, this sequence is not presented as an option. We must evaluate the given options.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Provided Options\n\nLet's analyze each option based on established principles of organic synthesis. Many options include steps like `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO2 to -NH2) and `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization of -NH2), suggesting complex routes that might use an amino group as a temporary director.\n\n*   **Option A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   i) **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. (Good)\n    *   ii) **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. (The meta-directing acetyl group makes this a good step).\n    *   iii) **Nitration:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Here, the directing effects conflict. The -COCH3 group (at C1) directs meta (to C5), while the -Br group (at C3) directs ortho/para (to C2, C4, C6). This conflict will result in a mixture of several isomers, meaning the yield of the desired 1,3,5-product will be low. This violates the \"high-yield\" condition. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical in the given order.\n\n*   **Option B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   i) **Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   ii) **Nitration:** Bromobenzene → 4-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n    *   iii) **Acylation:** This step involves Friedel-Crafts acylation on 4-bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group and moderately deactivated by the bromo group. **Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene derivatives.** This step will fail.\n\n*   **Option C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; ... v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   The first four steps convert benzene to benzene, which is illogical. Assuming we look at the core substitution sequence presented later (v, vi, vii): Bromination → Acylation → Nitration.\n    *   Acylation of bromobenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. Nitrating the major para-isomer (4-bromoacetophenone) would lead to 4-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone because both the bromo and acetyl groups direct to that position. This is not the desired 1,3,5-isomer.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   i) **Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) **Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) **Acylation:** This step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. **This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3)**, poisoning the catalyst and strongly deactivating the ring.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\n*   Options B, C, and D contain steps that are textbook examples of reactions that fail or give the wrong products. The Friedel-Crafts reaction is particularly sensitive and fails on aniline or rings with strong deactivating groups like -NO2.\n*   Option A consists of a sequence of reactions that will all proceed. However, step (iii), the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone, suffers from poor regioselectivity due to conflicting directing groups, which means it will not be a high-yield synthesis of the desired isomer.\n\nGiven that options B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed because they include reactions that do not work, Option A remains the only plausible, albeit imperfect, choice. It is common in such questions that one option is \"less wrong\" than others. The failure to achieve high yield in one step (Option A) is often considered a less severe error than a reaction that fails completely (Options B, C, D). The additional steps listed in Option A after step (iii) appear to be distractors, as they form a chemically illogical sequence. The core of the question is the order of the first three electrophilic substitutions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent ring is benzene.\n    *   It has three substituents:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:** In electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n    *   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and *ortho, para*-directing (often an intermediate).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies:**\n    *   **Strategy 1: All meta-directors.** A common way to achieve 1,3,5-substitution is to add meta-directing groups sequentially.\n        *   Path A: Benzene → Acetophenone (-COCH3, m-director) → 3-Nitroacetophenone (-COCH3 directs NO2 meta) → 1-(3-Bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone. In the last step, both -COCH3 and -NO2 are meta-directors at positions 1 and 3. They both direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the position that is meta to both of them, which is position 5. This is a very sound synthetic strategy, though it may require forcing conditions for the last step due to the deactivated ring. However, this exact sequence is not among the options.\n    *   **Strategy 2: Conflicting directors.** What if we have a mix of director types? The outcome depends on their relative strengths and positions.\n    *   **Strategy 3: Use a directing group and then remove it.** The Sandmeyer reaction (diazotization of an amino group, followed by replacement) or deamination (replacement with -H) allows for creating substitution patterns that are not directly accessible.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:** Let's analyze each sequence step-by-step.\n\n    *   **Option A:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n        *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n        *   ii) Bromobenzene → A mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene. The -Br is an o,p-director. The para isomer is major.\n        *   iii) 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts Acylation. This reaction works very poorly, or not at all, on rings that are strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This pathway is not high-yield. **Incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n        *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. Works well.\n        *   ii) Acetophenone → 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone. The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at the meta position (C3). This is a standard, high-yield reaction.\n        *   iii) 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone → ??. Here we nitrate a ring with a meta-director (-COCH3) and an ortho,para-director (-Br) in a meta relationship. This is a case of conflicting directing effects. The -Br directs to positions 2, 4, 6. The -COCH3 directs to position 5. One might assume that the o,p-director would win, leading to a mixture of 4- and 6-nitro products. However, the ring is significantly deactivated by both groups. Electrophilic attack at the positions ortho to the acetyl group (positions 2 and 4) is highly disfavored. Attack at position 2 is also sterically hindered. Therefore, attack at position 5, which is meta to both deactivating groups, becomes the \"least unfavorable\" pathway, making 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone the major product. This is a known, albeit somewhat counter-intuitive, reaction that gives the desired product in good yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) would modify this correct product, so they must be irrelevant distractors. This sequence is plausible.\n\n    *   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n        *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n        *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is Friedel-Crafts acylation. It fails on aniline because the amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex. **Incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...`\n        *   i-iv) Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene. This sequence of four steps just returns to the starting material, benzene. It is nonsensical. If we follow the subsequent steps starting from the regenerated benzene:\n        *   v) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n        *   vi) Bromobenzene → 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethanone (para product is major because -Br is an o,p-director).\n        *   vii) 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethanone → 1-(4-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethanone. Here, the -Br (o,p-director) and -COCH3 (m-director) are para to each other. They both direct nitration to position 3. The resulting product is the 1,3,4-isomer, not the desired 1,3,5-isomer. **Incorrect.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the detailed analysis, the first three steps of Option B provide the only viable, high-yield synthetic route to the target molecule among the choices. The apparent conflict in directing groups in step (iii) is resolved in favor of the desired product due to the electronic and steric environment of the deactivated ring.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and the provided reaction options.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   Let's number the ring starting from the acetyl group at C1. The bromo group is at C3, and the nitro group is at C5.\n*   This is a **1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene derivative**. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\nTo plan a synthesis, we must consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group)**: Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group)**: Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino group)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. This group is relevant as it is formed by reducing a nitro group (Fe/HCl).\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium ion)**: Formed from -NH2 in strong acid. Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nA critical rule in EAS is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (acylation and alkylation) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**. This means we cannot perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that already has a -NO2 group or other strongly deactivating groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating a \"Simple\" Direct Synthesis\nLet's first consider the most direct way to assemble the molecule. The Friedel-Crafts acylation must be done before the ring is strongly deactivated (i.e., before nitration).\n1.  **Acylation**: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n2.  Now we need to add -Br and -NO2 to acetophenone at the meta positions (C3 and C5). Let's consider the two possible orders.\n    *   **Order A: Nitrate then Brominate**\n        a. **Nitration**: Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-directing) → 3-Nitroacetophenone. This works well.\n        b. **Bromination**: 3-Nitroacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (at C1, m-director) and -NO2 (at C3, m-director). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position. The directing effects are **reinforcing**. This is an excellent synthetic step.\n        *This sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is a highly efficient and logical route to the target molecule.*\n\n    *   **Order B: Brominate then Nitrate**\n        a. **Bromination**: Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-directing) → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This works.\n        b. **Nitration**: 3-Bromoacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (at C1, m-director) and -Br (at C3, o,p-director). The directors are in **conflict**. -COCH3 directs to C5, while -Br directs to C2, C4, and C6. This would likely lead to a mixture of products and is not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nThe best simple route is Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. However, none of the options list this sequence. This suggests we must evaluate the given, more complex options, which likely involve using a temporary directing group that is later removed. The presence of the `Fe/HCl` (reduction), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination) sequence points to this strategy. This sequence effectively replaces a -NO2 group with a -H atom, via an -NH2 intermediate.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Given Options\n\n*   **Option A**: i) Acylation; ii) Bromination; iii) Nitration... This follows Order B discussed above. It's plausible but potentially low-yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically flawed if they are to follow step (iii). For instance, step (v) involves nitrating a product that contains an unprotected amino group under strongly acidic conditions, which would either oxidize the amine or protonate it into a meta-director, leading to the wrong product.\n\n*   **Option C & D**: Option C fails because step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, a strongly deactivated ring. This reaction does not work. Option D involves a circular sequence of steps (i-iv) that converts benzene back to benzene, making it nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option B**: Let's trace this pathway carefully. It employs the temporary directing group strategy.\n    i)   **Benzene → Nitrobenzene** (HNO3/H2SO4). Standard.\n    ii)  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline** (Fe/HCl). Standard reduction. The ring now has a powerful o,p-directing -NH2 group.\n    iii) **Aniline → p-Aminoacetophenone** (CH3COCl/AlCl3). This step is written as a Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline, which is problematic because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group. However, this sequence of reagents can be interpreted as a shorthand for an N-acylation followed by a **Fries Rearrangement**, which moves the acetyl group from the nitrogen to the ring, predominantly at the para position. Let's assume this gives p-aminoacetophenone.\n    iv) **p-Aminoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone** (Br2/FeBr3). We brominate p-aminoacetophenone. The strong o,p-directing -NH2 group at C4 will direct the bromine to its ortho position, C3. This is a plausible step.\n    v)  **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone** (HNO3/H2SO4). We nitrate the product from step (iv). Again, the powerful activating -NH2 group at C4 will direct the incoming -NO2 group to its other vacant ortho position, C5. (Note: In practice, the amino group would be protected as an amide to prevent oxidation and protonation, but in the context of a multiple-choice question, we assume the desired regiochemistry is achieved).\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazonium salt** (NaNO2/HCl). The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium group (-N2+).\n    vii) **Diazonium salt → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (H3PO2). The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThe final product has the -COCH3 group at C1, -Br at C3, and -NO2 at C5. This matches the target molecule exactly. Although this path relies on a charitable interpretation of steps (iii) and (v), it is the only sequence provided that logically leads to the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The other options contain chemically impossible steps or lead to incorrect products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   Let's assign the position of the acetyl group (-COCH3) as C1.\n*   The bromo group (-Br) is at C3.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is at C5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other on the ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the Substituent Properties (Directing Effects)**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of each substituent is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director. It is installed via Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director. It is installed via bromination (e.g., Br2/FeBr3).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director. It is installed via nitration (e.g., HNO3/H2SO4).\n\n**3. Key Constraints in Synthesis**\n\nThere are important rules and limitations in electrophilic aromatic substitution that must be considered:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation do not work on strongly deactivated benzene rings (e.g., those bearing a -NO2 group). They also fail on rings with an amino group (-NH2) because the amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl3).\n*   **Order Matters:** The order in which substituents are introduced determines the final substitution pattern, as each new substituent is directed by the groups already present on the ring.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each proposed reaction sequence based on these principles.\n\n**Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> p-Bromonitrobenzene** (major product) + o-Bromonitrobenzene.\n3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group and also deactivated by the -Br group. The Friedel-Crafts reaction will not proceed or will give a very low yield. **Therefore, Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline.** The -NH2 group is strongly activating and an *o,p*-director.\n3.  **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the catalyst and the ring, preventing the acylation reaction. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   The first four steps are: Nitration -> Reduction to Amine -> Diazotization -> Deamination. This sequence (i-iv) takes benzene and converts it back to benzene, making these steps redundant and illogical.\n*   Let's look at the sequence starting from benzene for the relevant substitutions: v) Br2/FeBr3 followed by vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3.\n1.  **Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> p-Bromoacetophenone** (major product) + o-Bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **p-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ???** Now we nitrate p-bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 at C1, -Br at C4). The -COCH3 group directs *meta* (to C3, C5). The -Br group directs *ortho* (to C3, C5). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions. So, the product will be 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. This is not the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.** This is the Friedel-Crafts acylation. An acetyl group (-COCH3) is added, which is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine will add to the meta position (C3). The structure is now correct for the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** We are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects are:\n    *   -COCH3 (at C1) is a *meta*-director, directing to C5.\n    *   -Br (at C3) is an *ortho, para*-director, directing to C2, C4, C6.\n    In cases of conflicting directors where one is a strong *meta*-director (like -COCH3) and the other is a weaker *o,p*-director (like -Br), the position that is least deactivated will be attacked. The -COCH3 group strongly deactivates its *ortho* and *para* positions (C2, C4, C6), making C5 the most favorable site for electrophilic attack. This reaction is known to produce the desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone in high yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence C successfully produce the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv-vii) appear to be erroneous additions to the question, as they would modify the correct product into something else. However, among the given choices, Option C is the only one that contains a valid and high-yield pathway to the desired product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions involves first introducing the *meta*-directing acetyl group, followed by sequential substitutions that are directed by the groups already on the ring to form the 1,3,5 pattern. Option C provides a valid synthetic route in its first three steps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere's a thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An **acetyl group (-COCH3)** at position 1. This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced by Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3).\n    *   A **bromo group (-Br)** at position 3. This is a deactivating group and an **ortho-, para-director**. It is introduced by electrophilic bromination (Br2/FeBr3).\n    *   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 5. This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced by nitration (HNO3/H2SO4).\n*   The substitution pattern is **1,3,5**. All three groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nThe goal is to add these three groups to a benzene ring in the correct positions to achieve high yield. The order of reactions is crucial due to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n*   **Constraint on Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. Therefore, the acetyl group (-COCH3) must be added to the ring before the nitro group, or at least when the ring is not yet strongly deactivated.\n\nLet's consider a direct approach by sequentially adding the groups.\n\n**Direct Synthesis Pathway (Hypothesis)**\n\nA highly logical and efficient pathway would be:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acylation.** Start with benzene and add the acetyl group. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Step 2: Nitration.** Nitrate acetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the meta position.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. This is a high-yield reaction.\n3.  **Step 3: Bromination.** Brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring now has two directors: -COCH3 (meta) and -NO2 (meta). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5. Their directing effects reinforce each other.\n    *   3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   Although the ring is heavily deactivated, making the reaction slow, it is very clean (regioselective) and should give a high yield of the desired product.\n\nThis three-step synthesis (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is the most chemically sound and high-yield route. Now, we must check if any of the given options match this sequence or another valid sequence.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nAll options present a seven-step sequence involving a recurring set of reagents: CH3COCl/AlCl3, Br2/FeBr3, HNO3/H2SO4 (x2), Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2. The sequence `Fe/HCl` (reduces NO2 to NH2) followed by `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) and `H3PO2` (deamination) is used to remove an amino group, which suggests a complex synthesis using a temporary directing group. However, let's analyze the options as written.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    This sequence starts by nitrating benzene to nitrobenzene, reducing it to aniline, then diazotizing and deaminating it back to benzene. This is a pointless circle and therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `...ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...`\n    This option attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation (iii) on aniline (product of step ii). This reaction does not work. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair on the amine (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-), which strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. Thus, this option is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `...ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...`\n    This sequence produces 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product from i and ii) and then attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation on it. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and especially the nitro group. The FC acylation will not proceed in any significant yield. Thus, this option is chemically incorrect for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard and effective first step.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so this step works well to produce the meta-brominated product.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ?** Here, we are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. We have two directing groups: -COCH3 (meta-director, at position 1) and -Br (ortho-, para-director, at position 3). The -COCH3 directs to position 5. The -Br directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The directing effects are in conflict. This will result in a mixture of isomers, with the main products being 3-bromo-4-nitro- and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone. The desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone will be formed, but as a minor product. Therefore, this step does not lead to a *high-yield* synthesis of the target compound.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Choice**\n\n*   Options A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps for a high-yield synthesis.\n*   The first three steps of Option C (`Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration`) can produce the desired molecule, although not in high yield due to the non-selective nitration in the third step.\n*   The optimal sequence (`Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination`) is not provided as an option.\n*   The steps following step (iii) in option C (`iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`) are nonsensical. They would involve reducing the product's nitro group, then attempting another nitration, and finally removing the newly formed amine, ultimately leading back to an earlier intermediate.\n\nGiven the choices, there appears to be a flaw in the question or the options. However, in a multiple-choice context, one must choose the \"best\" or \"least incorrect\" answer. Options B and D are fundamentally flawed with impossible reactions. Option A is circular. Option C, while not providing a \"high-yield\" route because of a single conflicting step, at least follows a sequence of individually plausible reactions that *can* lead to the formation of the target product. It's the most plausible synthetic logic among the choices, despite its significant drawbacks.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Ideal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern strongly suggests a specific strategy. To achieve this pattern with high yield, we should perform substitutions under the influence of *meta*-directing groups. The presence of an *ortho, para*-director (-Br) complicates things, so its introduction needs careful timing.\n\nA highly logical and efficient pathway would be:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation** of benzene to form acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Nitration** of acetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the *meta* position.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3.  **Bromination** of 3-nitroacetophenone. Now, the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3). Both are strong *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromo group to position C5. This reaction should be highly regioselective, giving the desired product.\n    *   3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule)\n\nThis ideal sequence of key reactions is: **Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's examine the options provided to see which one matches or most closely resembles this ideal strategy. We'll focus on the order of introduction of the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups. We will also consider the additional steps.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   This sequence is Bromination → Nitration → Acylation.\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and especially the nitro group, making this reaction extremely difficult and low-yield. This option is not viable for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   This sequence is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n    *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone. This is a good first step.\n    *   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The meta-directing -COCH3 group correctly places the bromine at C3.\n    *   iii) Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Here we have two directors: -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho, para).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs to C5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   The o,p-directing effect of the halogen typically overrides the meta-director. The positions activated by the halogen (C2, C4, C6) are kinetically favored over the highly deactivated C5 position (which is meta to both groups). This step would produce a mixture of isomers, with the desired 1,3,5 product being a very minor product. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" route under standard kinetic control.\n    *   However, compared to other options, this sequence starts plausibly. Friedel-Crafts on nitro-compounds (Options A, C) is generally considered to fail. While step (iii) in B has regioselectivity issues, the reaction itself is feasible. The question's reference to \"high yield\" might imply thermodynamic control where the more stable 1,3,5-isomer could be favored, or it might be that this is the \"best\" flawed option.\n    *   The subsequent steps (iv-vii) involving reduction and diazotization seem superfluous if the target is made at step (iii), suggesting they may be distractors or part of an convoluted and incorrect pathway.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) ... ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ...\n    *   This sequence attempts Acylation after Nitration and other steps. After steps (i) Nitration and (ii) Bromination, the intermediate would be 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation of 3-bromonitrobenzene fails for the same reason as in Option A: the ring is strongly deactivated.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with nitration, reduction to aniline, then deamination back to benzene, which is nonsensical.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Options A and C fail because they schedule a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a heavily deactivated, nitro-substituted ring.\n*   Option D is a logically flawed sequence.\n*   Option B follows a sequence of reactions where each step is chemically possible, although the nitration step (iii) suffers from poor regioselectivity for the desired product under normal conditions.\n\nDespite the low yield of the specific isomer in step (iii), Option B represents the most plausible sequence among the given choices, as the other options contain steps that are generally considered to be non-viable. The ideal pathway (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is a small permutation of Option B (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration). It's possible the question considers this route viable, perhaps assuming conditions that favor the thermodynamic 1,3,5 product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis question asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene with a high yield.\n\nLet's first analyze the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents:\n1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3)\n2.  A bromo group (-Br)\n3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. All three groups are `meta` to each other.\n-   -COCH3 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n-   -Br is a deactivating, ortho,para-directing group.\n-   -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring often involves using a powerful directing group that is later removed or modified. A common strategy is to use an amino group (-NH2), which is a strong ortho,para-director, and then remove it at the end of the synthesis via a Sandmeyer-type reaction (diazotization followed by reduction). The presence of steps involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO2 to -NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination, i.e., replacement of the diazonium group with -H) in options A, B, and C suggests such a strategy.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene:** This is the standard nitration of benzene. The nitro group is a meta-director.\nii) **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to a primary amine. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong ortho,para-director.\niii) **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?** This step represents Friedel-Crafts acylation. Direct acylation of aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivating anilinium complex. However, it is possible to achieve this transformation. A common way is N-acylation to form acetanilide, followed by a Fries rearrangement to yield ortho- and para-aminoacetophenone. The para-isomer is usually the major product. Let's assume this step yields **p-aminoacetophenone** [1-(4-aminophenyl)ethan-1-one].\niv) **p-Aminoacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> ?** Bromination. We now have two directing groups: -NH2 (at position 4, strong o,p-director) and -COCH3 (at position 1, m-director).\n    -   The -NH2 group directs bromination to its ortho positions (3 and 5).\n    -   The -COCH3 group directs bromination to its meta positions (3 and 5).\n    -   The groups are cooperative, so bromination will occur with high yield at position 3 (or 5, which is equivalent). The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\nv) **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Nitration. We now have three directing groups: -COCH3 (at 1, meta), -Br (at 3, o,p), and -NH2 (at 4, strong o,p).\n    -   -NH2 at C-4 directs to C-5 (position 3 is blocked).\n    -   -COCH3 at C-1 directs to C-5 (position 3 is blocked).\n    -   -Br at C-3 directs to C-2 and C-6.\n    -   The powerful activating -NH2 group and the meta-directing -COCH3 group both strongly direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. Their influence overrides the weaker directing effect of bromine. The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\nvi) **Diazotization --(NaNO2/HCl)-->** The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\nvii) **Deamination --(H3PO2)-->** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. This removes the amino group that was used to direct the substitutions.\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This synthetic pathway is logical and all steps contribute to the formation of the desired product in high yield.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) **Benzene -> Acetophenone:** (-COCH3 is a m-director).\nii) **Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** (-COCH3 directs Br to the meta position).\niii) **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Nitration. The ring has a -COCH3 group (meta-director) and a -Br group (o,p-director). The -Br group is a stronger director in terms of position, so nitration would primarily occur at positions 4 and 6 (ortho/para to bromine), not position 5 (meta to both). This step would not give the desired precursor in high yield. The rest of the sequence is nonsensical as it involves reducing the nitro group only to nitrate the ring again. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) **Benzene -> Bromobenzene:** (-Br is an o,p-director).\nii) **Bromobenzene -> p-Bromonitrobenzene:** Nitration gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with para being the major one.\niii) **p-Bromonitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?** Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so this reaction is extremely slow and low-yielding. Furthermore, both -Br and -NO2 direct the incoming acetyl group to position 2 (ortho to Br, meta to NO2). This would form 1-(2-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone, where the acetyl and bromo groups are ortho, not meta as required in the final product. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni-iv) **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline -> Diazonium salt -> Benzene:** These steps just nitrate benzene and then remove the nitro group, returning to the starting material. This is incorrect.\n\nConclusion: Option A outlines a viable and strategic synthesis route that uses an amino group as a temporary directing group to achieve the specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern required.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are `meta` to each other.\n\n2.  **Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    In electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new groups to specific positions.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a `meta`-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a `meta`-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an `ortho, para`-director.\n\n3.  **Devise a Plausible Synthesis Strategy:**\n    To obtain the 1,3,5-pattern, the substitutions should ideally be directed by `meta`-directing groups. The presence of the `ortho, para`-directing bromo group means the order of reactions is critical.\n\n    Let's consider putting the groups on in different orders.\n    *   **Strategy 1: Brominate first.** (Benzene → Bromobenzene). The -Br group is an o,p-director. Adding the next group (e.g., acetyl) would result in ortho and para products, not the required meta product. This is not an efficient starting point.\n    *   **Strategy 2: Nitrate first.** (Benzene → Nitrobenzene). The -NO2 group is a `meta`-director. The next substitution (e.g., bromination) would occur at the meta position, giving 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This establishes the correct relationship between Br and NO2. The next step would be to add the acetyl group. However, Friedel-Crafts acylation (the standard way to add an acetyl group) fails on rings that are strongly deactivated, especially by a nitro group. So, nitration should not precede acylation.\n    *   **Strategy 3: Acylate first.** (Benzene → Acetophenone). The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a `meta`-director.\n        *   The next step could be bromination. Brominating acetophenone places the -Br at the `meta` position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. The -COCH3 and -Br groups are now meta (1,3), which matches the target's relative positioning.\n        *   The final step would be nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Let's analyze the directing effects: we have an acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1 (meta-director) and a bromo group (-Br) at C3 (ortho,para-director).\n            *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n            *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n            *   This is a case of competing directors. However, substitution at position 5 is strongly favored because it is the position directed by the powerful meta-directing acetyl group. While Br directs elsewhere, the ring positions it favors (especially 2 and 4) are highly deactivated due to their proximity to the acetyl group. Therefore, the major product of this reaction is indeed 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   This sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is a chemically sound and efficient route to the target molecule.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    Now we match our proposed strategy with the choices provided.\n\n    *   **A) i) Br2/FeBr3...** Starts with bromination. Incorrect strategy for a 1,3,5 product. Also involves Friedel-Crafts on a nitrated ring (step iii after step ii), which fails.\n    *   **B) i) HNO3/H2SO4...vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3...** This option correctly performs acylation (vi) before nitration (vii). Let's trace the main pathway (ignoring the illogical steps i-iv that convert benzene back to benzene):\n        *   v) Bromination → Bromobenzene\n        *   vi) Acylation → 4-bromoacetophenone (para isomer is major)\n        *   vii) Nitration → The -COCH3 (at C1) and -Br (at C4) both direct to position 3. This yields 1-(4-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is the wrong isomer.\n    *   **C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...** This sequence involves a Friedel-Crafts acylation (iii) on aniline (product of step ii). This reaction fails because the amine's lone pair (a Lewis base) attacks the AlCl3 catalyst (a Lewis acid), deactivating it and the ring. The sequence is flawed.\n    *   **D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...** This option begins with the exact sequence we identified as the most plausible route:\n        *   i) **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone\n        *   ii) **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone\n        *   iii) **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (the target molecule)\n    *   The remaining steps (iv-vii) in option D are chemically nonsensical. For instance, step (iv) Fe/HCl would reduce the nitro group that was just added in step (iii). It seems the question lists a correct synthetic pathway followed by superfluous steps. Among the given choices, this is the only one that contains a correct and high-yield method to form the desired product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe sequence of reactions in option D, specifically the first three steps, provides a direct and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The other options either follow incorrect synthetic strategies, lead to the wrong isomer, or contain chemically non-viable steps early in the sequence. Therefore, Option D represents the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThis problem asks for the sequence of reactions that leads to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It's a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\nLet's consider the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. This group is often used as a powerful director and then removed.\n*   **-NHCOCH3 (acetamido):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's a protected form of the amino group.\n\n**2. Evaluate a Direct Synthesis Approach**\n\nA simple, direct approach would be to add the three groups sequentially to the benzene ring.\n*   **Path A:** Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 3-Nitroacetophenone. The nitration occurs at the meta position, which is position 3.\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> Both -COCH3 and -NO2 are *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This would give the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    This pathway is chemically sound and would lead to the correct product. However, it's a 3-step synthesis, and all the options provided are 7 steps long. This suggests a more complex strategy is intended, likely because the final bromination step on a ring deactivated by two groups (-COCH3 and -NO2) might have a low yield. The long sequences in the options, which include steps for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and deamination (H3PO2), strongly point towards a strategy where an amino group is used as a temporary directing group and then removed.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthesis Strategy Involving Deamination**\n\nThe deamination strategy involves using a powerful ortho,para-directing amino group to install substituents in specific locations and then removing it at the end of the synthesis. The final product has unsubstituted positions at 2, 4, and 6. This means the precursor molecule had an amino group at one of these positions, which was subsequently removed.\n\nLet's work backward. To get the final product by removing an amino group, the precursor must have been an aminobromonitroacetophenone. For example, if we remove an amino group from position 4, the precursor would be 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The removal of the -NH2 from C4 would leave substituents at C1(-COCH3), C3(-Br), and C5(-NO2), which is exactly the target molecule.\n\nLet's devise a synthesis for this precursor: 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nA logical starting point for this is p-aminoacetophenone or its protected form, p-acetamidoacetophenone. Let's see how we can use its directing groups. The key intermediate is p-acetamidoacetophenone.\nOn this molecule (C1: -COCH3, C4: -NHCOCH3):\n*   The acetamido group (-NHCOCH3) is a strong activating *o,p*-director. It will direct incoming groups to its ortho positions (C3 and C5).\n*   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a deactivating *m*-director. It directs to C3 and C5.\n\nBoth groups direct substituents to the same positions (3 and 5). This convergence of directing effects leads to high yields.\nLet's perform bromination and nitration:\n*   **Bromination first, then nitration:**\n    1.  *p-Acetamidoacetophenone* + Br2 -> The bromine will add to position 3 (ortho to -NHAc). Product: *4-acetamido-3-bromoacetophenone*.\n    2.  Nitrate this product: We have -NHAc (at C4), -Br (at C3), and -COCH3 (at C1).\n        *   -NHAc (strong o,p-director) directs to C5.\n        *   -Br (o,p-director) directs to C5 (para position).\n        *   -COCH3 (m-director) directs to C5.\n        All three groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This is a highly selective reaction. Product: *4-acetamido-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone*.\n*   The sequence to get the final product from here is:\n    3.  **Hydrolysis** of the acetamido group (-NHCOCH3) to an amino group (-NH2) using acid (e.g., H3O+). Product: *4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone*.\n    4.  **Diazotization** of the amino group with NaNO2/HCl.\n    5.  **Deamination** (removal of the diazonium group) with H3PO2 to give the final product.\n\n**4. Match the Synthesis Path to the Options**\n\nNow, let's find the option that matches this logical, high-yield pathway. The key substitution order on the intermediate is Bromination then Nitration.\n\nThe required steps are:\nBenzene -> Aniline -> Acetanilide/p-aminoacetophenone intermediate -> Add acetyl group -> Bromination -> Nitration -> Hydrolysis -> Diazotization -> Deamination.\n\nLet's analyze Option B:\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) & ii):** Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. This creates the key starting amine.\n*   **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This step is meant to acylate aniline. While the reagents are typically for Friedel-Crafts acylation of a ring, in the context of these options, it's the step that introduces an acetyl group. Let's assume this sequence (perhaps N-acetylation followed by Fries Rearrangement, or FC acylation of acetanilide) produces the key intermediate *p-aminoacetophenone* (or *p-acetamidoacetophenone*).\n*   **iv) Br2/FeBr3:** This is bromination.\n*   **v) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is nitration.\n*   **vi) & vii):** This is the diazotization and deamination sequence.\n\nThis option follows the correct order of functional group introductions (apart from some ambiguities/missing steps like protection/deprotection): creation of an aniline derivative, followed by bromination, then nitration, and finally removal of the guiding amino group. The intermediate steps are guided by the powerful activating effects of the amino/acetamido group, leading to the desired regiochemistry in high yield. The implicit protection/deprotection steps are likely assumed or bundled into the reagent steps in this multiple-choice question format.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options fail:\n*   **A:** Creates benzene after 4 steps, making no sense.\n*   **C:** Nitrates 3-bromoacetophenone. The directors conflict, leading to a mixture of isomers and low yield of the required intermediate.\n*   **D:** Attempts Friedel-Crafts on a highly deactivated ring (p-bromonitrobenzene), which is difficult, and subsequent steps lead to the wrong isomer.\n\nTherefore, option B represents the most chemically sound and high-yield synthesis pathway, despite its condensed and somewhat imprecise notation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3). Let's place this at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nTo plan the synthesis, we must consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles during Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** A deactivating group and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\nA key reaction in these sequences is the **Friedel-Crafts acylation** (to add the -COCH3 group). A critical rule for this reaction is that it **fails on strongly deactivated rings**, particularly those substituted with a nitro group (-NO2). This implies that the acetyl group must be introduced *before* the nitro group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's examine each option based on these principles.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   The sequence begins with nitration (i), making nitrobenzene.\n    *   It then attempts acylation (vi) *after* bromination (v), on bromobenzene. This would produce mainly *para*-bromoacetophenone (4-bromoacetophenone), not the *meta* isomer needed.\n    *   The overall sequence is illogical and leads to the wrong isomer. Steps (i) to (iv) are a roundabout way of converting benzene to benzene, which makes no sense.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   The sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene (i), then reduction to aniline (ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and inhibiting the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   This sequence starts by making bromobenzene (i), then p-bromonitrobenzene (ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on p-bromonitrobenzene. The presence of the strongly deactivating nitro group prevents this reaction from occurring.\n    *   Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   Let's analyze the steps sequentially:\n        1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 on benzene:** This is Friedel-Crafts acylation, which forms **acetophenone**. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director. This is a good starting point.\n        2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3 on acetophenone:** This is bromination. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3, forming **3-bromoacetophenone**. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n        3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4 on 3-bromoacetophenone:** This is nitration. We need to add the -NO2 group at position 5. Let's look at the directing effects in 3-bromoacetophenone:\n            *   The -COCH3 group (at 1) is a meta-director, directing the -NO2 group to position 5.\n            *   The -Br group (at 3) is an ortho, para-director, directing the -NO2 group to positions 2, 4, and 6 on the ring.\n            *   Although the directors are in conflict, it is known experimentally that nitration occurs preferentially at position 5, which is meta to both existing deactivating groups, likely because this position is sterically accessible and electronically least disfavored. This reaction gives the desired product, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, in high yield.\n    *   The first three steps of this sequence constitute a logical and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) seem illogical and extraneous (e.g., reducing a nitro group that was just added, followed by another nitration). They are likely included in error in the problem statement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating options A, B, and D based on fundamental chemical principles, we are left with C. The first three steps of sequence C provide a chemically sound and efficient route to the target product. Therefore, C is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is an **acetophenone** derivative, meaning it has a benzene ring with an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The numbering indicates that if the acetyl group is at position 1, the bromine is at position 3, and the nitro group is at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are **meta** to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl)**: Deactivating and **meta**-directing.\n*   **-Br (bromo)**: Deactivating (weakly) and **ortho, para**-directing.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Deactivating (strongly) and **meta**-directing.\n\nThe final 1,3,5-pattern is difficult to achieve directly because the bromo group is an ortho, para-director, which conflicts with the meta-positions of the other two groups. This suggests a more complex synthesis, possibly involving a \"place-holder\" group that is later removed or modified. The presence of the deamination sequence `(Fe/HCl; NaNO2/HCl; H3PO2)` in the options is a strong hint that an amino group (derived from a nitro group) is used as a temporary directing group and then removed.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence of reactions:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction **fails** on strongly activated rings like aniline because the nitrogen atom of the amino group coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex (-NH2+-AlCl3), which prevents the reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination)\nSteps (i) through (iv) simply convert benzene to benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be a synthetic route. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product)\n*   iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings substituted with strong deactivating groups like -NO2. This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis is the only remaining option. Let's trace the reactions carefully:\n*   i) Benzene → **Acetophenone**: Introduces the acetyl group (-COCH3). This is a meta-director.\n*   ii) Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**: The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position.\n*   iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → Nitration. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3) and an ortho, para-director (-Br). Their effects conflict. This step produces a mixture of isomers. However, a significant amount of the **3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone** isomer is formed, which can be isolated.\n*   iv) 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one**: The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   v) 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one → Nitration. The new amino group is a very powerful activating, ortho, para-director. It will control the position of the next substitution. Its para position is blocked by the acetyl group, and one ortho position (C3) is blocked by the bromine. Therefore, nitration occurs exclusively at the other ortho position, C5. The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   vi) The product from step (v) is treated with NaNO2/HCl. This converts the amino group at C4 into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   vii) The diazonium salt is treated with H3PO2. This is a deamination reaction that removes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This sequence, while complex, is chemically sound and leads to the desired target molecule in a controlled way, using a temporary amino group to direct a key substitution before being removed.\n\nTherefore, sequence B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's draw its structure. The parent is ethanone (an acetyl group, -COCH3) attached to a phenyl ring. The substituents on the phenyl ring are:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a meta-relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent affects further electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider putting the groups on one by one.\n\n*   **Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the *meta* position. Now we have substituents at positions 1 and 3.\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → In 3-nitroacetophenone, both the acetyl group (at C1) and the nitro group (at C3) are *meta*-directors. They will both direct an incoming electrophile (Br+) to position C5. This route is chemically sound from a directing-effects standpoint and would produce the desired 1-acetyl-3-bromo-5-nitrobenzene. However, the ring is heavily deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, which can make the final bromination step low-yielding. This specific sequence is not one of the options.\n\n*   **Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This works.\n    3.  3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Now we have a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The bromine is the stronger director (less deactivating). It directs the incoming nitro group to its *ortho* (C2, C4) and *para* (C6) positions. The *meta*-director (-COCH3) directs to C5. The major products would be 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone and 1-(3-bromo-6-nitrophenyl)ethanone, not the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone. Thus, this route will not give a high yield of the target molecule.\n\nSince simple routes have flaws or are not listed, we must consider more complex syntheses involving the modification or removal of directing groups. The presence of reagents for reduction of nitro groups (Fe/HCl) and deamination (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests such a strategy.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n    *   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) fail on strongly deactivated rings. The presence of a nitro group prevents this reaction. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n    *   This sequence of the first four steps simply converts benzene back to benzene, which makes no synthetic sense. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a deactivating -NH3+ group, which would direct *meta*. So, we might get 3-aminoacetophenone. Let's follow this.\n    *   iv) Bromination of 3-aminoacetophenone. The -NH2 group is a very strong *ortho, para*-director and will control the substitution, leading to bromination at positions 2, 4, or 6, not the required position 5.\n    *   Alternatively, step iii) might represent N-acylation (protection) to form acetanilide. The sequence would then proceed with further substitutions that, as explored in other cases, do not lead to the 1,3,5 pattern. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    Let's trace this synthetic pathway carefully.\n    1.  **i) Acylation:** Benzene → **Acetophenone**.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. (-COCH3 is a meta-director). Correct.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → **1-(3-Bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. As discussed, nitration is directed by the Br to positions 4 and 6. We can assume the 4-nitro isomer is formed as a major product and can be separated for the next step.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine. 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one → **1-(4-Amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    5.  **v) Nitration:** We nitrate 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one. Under the acidic conditions (HNO3/H2SO4), the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. To ensure correct directing, it's more likely that the amino group is first protected as an amide (-NHCOCH3), which is a strong *ortho, para*-director, and this protection step is implied. Let's analyze the directing effects with a protected amino group (acetamido group, -NHCOCH3) at position 4.\n        *   The powerful activating acetamido group at C4 directs *ortho* to it, which is C3 (occupied by Br) and C5.\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1 is a *meta*-director, directing to C5.\n        *   Both key groups direct the incoming nitro group to C5. Product: **1-(4-acetamido-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. (After reaction, the protecting group needs to be removed by hydrolysis, an implied step). This gives **1-(4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    7.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom using H3PO2.\n\nThe removal of the temporary directing group at position 4 leaves the final substituents at the desired positions: Acetyl (C1), Bromo (C3), and Nitro (C5). This complex but logical pathway successfully produces the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A outlines a valid, albeit sophisticated, synthetic route that utilizes a temporary directing group (which starts as a nitro group, is converted to an amine, and then removed) to achieve the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern. The other options contain chemically flawed steps.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. This means all substituents are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a moderately deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation (e.g., CH₃COCl/AlCl₃).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced via nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄).\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a weakly deactivating group and an **ortho, para-director**. It is introduced via bromination (e.g., Br₂/FeBr₃).\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the general strategy is to introduce meta-directing groups first to guide the subsequent additions. The presence of the ortho, para-directing bromo group makes the sequence tricky.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step.\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an o,p-director.\n*   Step ii: Bromobenzene → p-Nitrobromobenzene (major product) and o-Nitrobromobenzene.\n*   Step iii: This step attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on nitrobromobenzene. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings substituted with strongly deactivating groups like the nitro group (-NO₂). Therefore, this step will fail or give a negligible yield. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction).\n*   Step iii: Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt (diazotization).\n*   Step iv: Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene (deamination).\nThis sequence of four steps simply transforms benzene into nitrobenzene and then back to benzene. This is a futile loop and cannot be part of an efficient synthesis. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   Step iii: This attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂) to form a complex (-NH₃⁺), which is a strong deactivator and meta-director. While acylation at the meta position might occur, the reaction is generally problematic. Furthermore, subsequent steps would lead to the wrong isomers or messy products. A more fundamental issue can be identified by re-ordering the first steps of this option. A common proposed path for such molecules involves nitration then bromination, then trying to add the acetyl group: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> m-Bromonitrobenzene. Trying to perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on m-Bromonitrobenzene would fail for the same reason as in Option A (presence of the -NO₂ group). Any permutation starting with nitration will have difficulty with a subsequent Friedel-Crafts step. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → **Acetophenone**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a meta-director.\n*   Step ii: Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine will be directed to the meta (3) position. This is a good regioselective step.\n*   Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents:\n    *   -COCH₃ (at pos 1) is a **meta-director**, directing the new -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   -Br (at pos 3) is an **ortho, para-director**, directing the new -NO₂ group to positions 2, 4, and 6 (relative to the bromine atom, which corresponds to positions 2, 4, 6 on the ring).\n    The directing effects of the two groups are in conflict. However, both groups are deactivating. When placing a third substituent, the position that is meta to both existing meta-substituents (like here) is generally least disfavored electronically (even though one director is o,p). Position 5 is meta to the acetyl group and meta to the bromo group. Although this reaction would likely produce a mixture of isomers (meaning it is not strictly \"high-yield\" for just one product), it is the most plausible route among the given choices to form the desired product. In many contexts, this sequence is considered viable.\n*   Steps iv to vii appear superfluous and nonsensical if the desired product is formed in step iii. It's likely an error in the question's construction. However, the initial sequence `i-iii` is the most chemically sound path to the product among all options. It correctly installs the groups in an order that can lead to the desired connectivity, unlike the other options which contain impassable chemical hurdles or create the wrong isomers.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, sequence C provides the most plausible (though imperfect) route. It avoids fatal flaws like attempting Friedel-Crafts on a nitro-deactivated ring and leads to the correct arrangement of substituents, even if the regioselectivity of the final nitration step is not perfect. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone, which is a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    *   -COCH3 (acetyl group) at position 1.\n    *   -Br (bromo group) at position 3.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro group) at position 5.\n*   This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent affects further electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho-, para*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho-, para*-director. (This group appears in intermediate steps).\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director. (Forms when -NH2 is in strong acid).\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthesis Strategies**\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Direct Substitution**\n    If we sequentially add the three groups, the directors on the ring must guide the incoming groups to the correct positions. Since all groups are meta to each other, a good strategy would be to have meta-directing groups on the ring.\n    1.  **Benzene --(Acylation)--> Acetophenone** (-COCH3 is a *meta*-director).\n    2.  **Acetophenone --(Nitration)--> 3-Nitroacetophenone** (The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position).\n    3.  **3-Nitroacetophenone --(Bromination)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. In this step, both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) are *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to C5. This is a very straightforward and chemically sound synthesis. However, this simple 3-step synthesis is not among the 7-step options provided. This suggests a more complex route is intended.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Use of a Removable Directing Group**\n    The long sequences involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of nitro to amino), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination) are a strong indicator that an amino group (-NH2) is used as a temporary directing group and is later removed. This is a common strategy for achieving substitution patterns that are not accessible by direct substitution.\n\n**4. Analyze the Provided Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    ii) Bromobenzene is an o,p-director, so nitration yields o- and p-bromonitrobenzene.\n    iii) The next step is Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on p-bromonitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...**\n    i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene (Deamination with H3PO2).\n    The first four steps convert benzene back into benzene, which makes no sense. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ...**\n    i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    iii) The reaction of aniline with CH3COCl/AlCl3 is problematic for Friedel-Crafts acylation. If we assume it protects the amine to form acetanilide (-NHCOCH3), then:\n    iv) Bromination of acetanilide gives p-bromoacetanilide.\n    v) Nitration of p-bromoacetanilide gives 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide.\n    vi & vii) Hydrolysis (a missing step), followed by diazotization and deamination of 4-bromo-2-nitroaniline would yield 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n    This sequence does not produce the target molecule. Thus, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence uses the removable directing group strategy. Let's trace the steps:\n    i) **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.**\n    ii) **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone.** Here, the -Br is an o,p-director and directs nitration primarily to its ortho (C4, C6) and para positions. C4 is a likely position. The product is NOT the final target. This nitro group will serve as a precursor to our temporary directing group.\n    iv) **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone --(Fe/HCl)--> 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    v) **3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone.** This is the crucial step. We need to install the final nitro group. In the strong acid medium, the amino group is protonated to anilinium (-NH3+), a meta-director. Let's analyze the directing effects for nitration:\n        *   -COCH3 at C1 (meta-director) directs to C5.\n        *   -Br at C3 (o,p-director) directs to C2 and C6.\n        *   -NH3+ at C4 (meta-director) directs to C2 and C6.\n        While there is conflicting direction, substitution at C5 is plausible. Given that this is the only logical pathway among the options, we assume this step proceeds to give the required product for a \"high-yield\" synthesis context.\n    vi) **3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> ...diazonium salt.** The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    vii) **...diazonium salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\n    This sequence logically constructs the target molecule by installing and then removing a directing group. Although the regioselectivity of step (v) is complex, this option presents the only coherent synthetic plan among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's identify the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position C1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position C3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\nLet's also recall the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3**: Meta-directing and deactivating.\n*   **-Br**: Ortho, para-directing and deactivating.\n*   **-NO2**: Meta-directing and strongly deactivating.\n\nThe challenge is to install these three groups in the correct 1,3,5-pattern. The presence of an ortho,para-director (-Br) among two meta-directors makes a straightforward sequential substitution tricky.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe will evaluate each proposed reaction sequence step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene. (-Br is o,p-director).\n*   ii) Bromobenzene -> p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n*   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation). The ring is strongly deactivated by both the -Br and -NO2 groups. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium salt.\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium salt -> Benzene.\nThis sequence of four steps starts with benzene and ends with benzene, which is a pointless exercise for a synthesis. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-director).\n*   ii) Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone (meta-position is favored).\n*   iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone -> Nitration. The directors are -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho,para).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C2, C4, and C6.\n    This leads to competing directing effects. While the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer is the major product, significant amounts of other isomers are formed (experimental data shows ~49% yield for the desired product). This is not considered a \"high-yield\" synthesis. Furthermore, the subsequent steps (iv-vii) involve reduction of the nitro group and then re-introduction of other groups, which makes no sense if the target molecule was already formed. This option is highly problematic.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence is long and involves the formation and eventual removal of an amino group (indicated by steps vi and vii), a common strategy for achieving \"unnatural\" substitution patterns. Let's trace this path carefully.\n\n*   **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> Aniline.**\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3**. This step is key. Direct Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline is difficult. However, the reagents are appropriate for an N-acylation followed by a **Fries Rearrangement**.\n    *   Aniline + CH3COCl -> Acetanilide (N-acylation).\n    *   Acetanilide + AlCl3 (heat) -> p-Aminoacetophenone (major product via Fries Rearrangement). The acetyl group migrates from the nitrogen to the para position of the ring.\n*   **iv) p-Aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> Bromination.** We are brominating p-aminoacetophenone.\n    *   The substituents are -NH2 (at C4, strong o,p-director) and -COCH3 (at C1, m-director).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the same positions: C3 and C5.\n    *   This reinforcement leads to a clean monobromination at position C3 (ortho to the powerful activating -NH2 group). The product is **3-bromo-4-aminoacetophenone**.\n*   **v) 3-bromo-4-aminoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration.**\n    *   Substituents: -COCH3 (C1, m-director), -Br (C3, o,p-director), -NH2 (C4, o,p-director).\n    *   The -NH2 and -COCH3 groups both direct the incoming -NO2 to position C5. The -Br directs elsewhere (C2, C6).\n    *   The strong directing effect of the -NH2 and -COCH3 groups towards the same position (C5) makes this a highly selective nitration. The product is **3-bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone**.\n*   **vi) & vii) Diazotization and Deamination.**\n    *   vi) The primary amine at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt ([_N≡N_]⁺) with NaNO2/HCl.\n    *   vii) The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2).\n\nThe removal of the temporary amino group from C4 yields the final target molecule: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis entire sequence is chemically sound, uses reinforcing directive effects to achieve high yields and selectivity at each key step, and correctly utilizes a blocking/directing group that is later removed. Therefore, it represents the best high-yield synthesis among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a detailed reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position C1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position C3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C5.\n\nThe substituents are located at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means each substituent is **meta** to the other two.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\nThe final product has a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. This pattern is most easily achieved when the substituents already on the ring are meta-directors, as they will direct the next incoming group to the desired position. The presence of an ortho,para-directing bromine atom in a meta-meta relationship with two other groups suggests a careful ordering of steps is required.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence Option\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Puts a -NO2 group on the ring (meta-director).\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** The -NO2 group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2), which is a strongly activating ortho,para-director.\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a positively charged ammonium complex (-NH3+), which is strongly deactivating and prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation of the ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect because step (iii) is not feasible as written.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation puts an acetyl group (-COCH3) on the ring. This group is a meta-director. This is a good starting point.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) to the meta position (C3). The product is 1-acetyl-3-bromobenzene. This aligns with the target structure.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → Nitration:** Now we nitrate a ring with an acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) and a bromo group at C3 (ortho,para-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   This is a case of competing directors. However, in such 1,3-disubstituted systems, the substitution happens at the position that is least deactivated. Position C5 is meta to both the strong deactivating acetyl group and the weak deactivating bromo group. Experimentally, nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone gives the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product. The directing effect of the acetyl group to position C5 governs the reaction outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence successfully synthesize the target molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are superfluous and would modify the product further, but the initial path is correct.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene:** Puts a -Br on the ring (ortho,para-director).\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene:** The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group mainly to the para position (C4), yielding 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n*   **iii) 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene → Acylation:** Now we have -Br at C1 (o,p-director) and -NO2 at C4 (m-director).\n    *   -Br directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   -NO2 directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   Both groups reinforce substitution at position C2 (or C6). The product would be 2-acetyl-1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (or 1-acetyl-2-bromo-5-nitrobenzene), which is the wrong isomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   **i-iv) Benzene → Benzene:** This sequence is i) Nitration, ii) Reduction to aniline, iii) Diazotization, iv) Deamination. The net result of these four steps is the conversion of benzene back into benzene. This sequence is illogical. The subsequent steps (v, vi, vii) form a different isomer, 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option B outlines a viable synthetic route to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The first three steps constitute a logical and efficient synthesis. Although the option includes unnecessary additional steps, it is the only choice that contains the correct pathway.\n\nThe correct sequence is:\n1.  **Acylation** of benzene to form acetophenone.\n2.  **Bromination** of acetophenone to form 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Nitration** of 3-bromoacetophenone to form 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis corresponds to the beginning of sequence B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5 relative to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   Acetyl (-COCH3): meta-director, deactivating.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2): meta-director, strongly deactivating.\n    *   Bromo (-Br): ortho, para-director, deactivating.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern with a mix of meta- and ortho,para-directors suggests that a simple sequential substitution might not be effective and could lead to mixtures of isomers. Often, complex substitution patterns are achieved using a \"directing group\" that is later removed. The presence of reagents for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by reduction (H3PO2) in the options strongly hints at a strategy involving the removal of an amino (-NH2) group. This is a classic synthetic tool known as deamination.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Reaction Options\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n#### **Option B**\ni) `Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene`\nii) `Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline`\niii) `Aniline --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Benzenediazonium chloride`\niv) `Benzenediazonium chloride --(H3PO2)--> Benzene`\nThis sequence of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is a pointless circular synthesis. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n#### **Option D**\ni) `Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene`\nii) `Bromobenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene` (para is the major product).\niii) `1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?` This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. Such reactions generally fail or give extremely low yields. This makes the entire sequence not a \"high-yield synthesis\". Therefore, Option D is highly unlikely.\n\n#### **Option C**\ni) `Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene`\nii) `Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline`\niii) `Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?` This reaction is problematic. Aniline reacts with the Lewis acid AlCl3 at the nitrogen atom, deactivating the ring. Acetyl chloride would primarily acylate the nitrogen to form acetanilide, for which a Lewis acid is not typically used. Assuming it's intended to form acetanilide:\n`... --> Acetanilide`\niv) `Acetanilide --(Br2/FeBr3)-->` Bromination of the activated acetanilide ring, likely giving p-bromoacetanilide.\nv) `p-Bromoacetanilide --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` Nitration occurs ortho to the activating -NHCOCH3 group, yielding 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide.\nvi) `4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide --(NaNO2/HCl)--> No reaction`. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2), not an amide (-NHCOCH3). The amide would need to be hydrolyzed first, a step that is missing. Therefore, Option C is chemically flawed as written.\n\n#### **Option A**\nThis option appears long and complex, but let's analyze it carefully, assuming it might involve the formation of a key intermediate that rearranges the substitution pattern correctly.\n\ni) `Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone`\nThe -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n\nii) `Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone`\nThe acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. This is correct.\n\niii) `3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitration Product`\nWe have two deactivating groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1) and -Br (at C3). -COCH3 is a meta-director (directs to C5). -Br is an o,p-director (directs to C2, C4, C6). When directing effects conflict, the least deactivating group often controls the position. Here, -Br is less deactivating than -COCH3. Thus, substitution will be directed by the bromine to the ortho and para positions relative to it. The para position (C6) is sterically favored. This nitration would yield 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone (which can also be named 5-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone). Let's assume this is our product.\n\niv) `5-Bromo-2-nitroacetophenone --(Fe/HCl)--> 5-Bromo-2-aminoacetophenone`\nThe nitro group is reduced to a primary amine.\n\nv) `5-Bromo-2-aminoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitration Product`\nNow we nitrate this molecule. Let's analyze the directing effects on the available positions (C3, C4, C6):\n*   -NH2 group (at C2): A very strong activating o,p-director. It directs to its ortho position C3 and its para position C5 (which is blocked by -Br). Thus, it strongly directs the new group to C3.\n*   -COCH3 group (at C1): A meta-director. It directs to C3 and C5 (blocked). So it also directs to C3.\n*   -Br group (at C5): An o,p-director. It directs to C4 and C6.\nThe powerful activating -NH2 group and the -COCH3 group reinforce each other to direct the incoming nitro group to position C3. This reaction should be highly regioselective.\nThe product is **2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone**.\n\nvi) `2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium Salt`\nThe primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n\nvii) `Diazonium Salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`\nThe diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).

    "Here is a detailed reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's identify its key features:\n*   A benzene ring as the core structure.\n*   Three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. This means all three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order of introducing these groups is critical and depends on their directing effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**. This group is relevant because the presence of reagents like Fe/HCl and NaNO2/H3PO2 in the options indicates a potential synthesis route involving the introduction and subsequent removal of an amino group (a \"placeholder\" strategy).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Provided Options**\n\nWe must evaluate each sequence based on established principles of organic synthesis.\n*   **Key Constraint:** Friedel-Crafts reactions, such as the acylation step (CH3COCl/AlCl3), fail on strongly deactivated rings, particularly those bearing a nitro group (-NO2). They also fail on aniline (-NH2) because the basic nitrogen atom complexes with the AlCl3 catalyst, deactivating the ring.\n\nLet's examine the options as they are presented in the prompt:\n*   **Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ... iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    This sequence introduces the acetyl group after nitration (step ii). This requires a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a bromonitrobenzene derivative, which is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. The reaction would not proceed with a high yield, if at all. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that accomplishes nothing towards the synthesis. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    This sequence begins by making aniline (steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii). As mentioned, this reaction fails due to the reaction between the basic amino group and the Lewis acid catalyst. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence is the only one remaining and must be analyzed in detail. It represents a sophisticated synthetic strategy that uses a temporary group to control regiochemistry.\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the meta-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the bromine to the meta position. This establishes the correct 1,3 relationship between these two groups.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Although the directing effects are conflicting, this step places a nitro group on the ring that will serve as a precursor for a powerful temporary directing group. The 4-nitro isomer is a significant product that is used in the next step.\n    4.  **iv) 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone:** Reduction of the nitro group at C4 creates a powerful ortho,para-directing amino group.\n    5.  **v) 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone:** This is the key regioselective step. The new nitro group must be added.\n        *   The powerful activating -NH2 group (at C4) directs strongly to its ortho position (C5).\n        *   The meta-directing -COCH3 group (at C1) also directs to C5.\n        The reinforcing directing effects of these two groups ensure that nitration occurs cleanly and in high yield at position 5.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group at C4, having served its directing purpose, is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    7.  **vii) Deamination (H3PO2):** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n\nThis final step reveals the target molecule with the correct 1,3,5 substitution pattern. This entire sequence is chemically sound, sophisticated, and addresses the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption B is the only chemically valid sequence that leads to the target product in high yield. The other options contain steps that would fail or are synthetically illogical. The reasoning provided in several of the candidate answers (e.g., Answer 6, Answer 39) that correctly analyzes this complex 7-step pathway is the most complete and accurate.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substituents are all **meta** with respect to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃)**: A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br)**: A deactivating group but an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂)**: A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (-NH₂)**: A strongly activating group and an **ortho-, para-director**. (Relevant as it's formed by reducing a nitro group, a common tactic).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Direct Synthesis vs. Indirect Synthesis\n\nA direct synthesis would involve adding the three groups sequentially to the benzene ring. For example:\n*   Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration.\n*   Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n\nLet's consider the sequence: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration.\n1.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone**. The -COCH₃ group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone**. Bromine adds meta to the acetyl group. This works.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   In 3-bromoacetophenone, the -COCH₃ group (at C1) directs meta (to C5). The -Br group (at C3) directs ortho/para (to C2, C4, C6). The directing effects are conflicting.\n    *   Furthermore, adding a third deactivating group to a ring that already has two is difficult and typically results in low yields. The question asks for a **high-yield** synthesis.\n\nThis suggests that a more sophisticated, indirect route is required. The presence of steps like `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO₂ to -NH₂) and `NaNO₂/HCl` followed by `H₃PO₂` (diazotization and deamination, i.e., removal of the -NH₂ group) in the options strongly hints at a common synthetic strategy where an amino group is used as a powerful director and then removed at the end.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Options with the Deamination Strategy\n\nThe sequence `... -> Fe/HCl -> NaNO₂/HCl -> H₃PO₂` implies that a nitro group is introduced, used to create an amino directing group, and then this group is removed from the molecule. Let's trace the options with this in mind.\n\n*   **Option A**: Starts with bromination, then nitration. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is too strongly deactivated by the nitro and bromo groups. So, **A is incorrect**.\n*   **Option B**: The sequence of steps i-iv (`Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline -> Diazonium salt -> Benzene`) is circular and makes no sense. So, **B is incorrect**.\n*   **Option D**: Involves reacting aniline with `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`. This Friedel-Crafts acylation is problematic on aniline. Even if we assume it works or that it implies N-acylation, the subsequent steps do not logically lead to the target without missing steps (like hydrolysis). For example, step (vi) `NaNO₂/HCl` requires a primary amine, but the product from step (v) would be an acetanilide (an amide). So, **D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: Let's trace this sequence carefully. This path turns out to be a clever, multi-step synthesis that achieves the desired product in high yield.\n\n    i.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone**.\n        *   An acetyl group is added. It's a meta-director.\n\n    ii. **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n        *   The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to position 3.\n\n    iii. **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**.\n        *   This is a key step. The directing effects of -COCH₃ (meta) and -Br (ortho, para) are conflicting. While the 5-nitro isomer is also formed, the 4-nitro isomer is a significant product that is required for the subsequent steps of this sequence.\n\n    iv. **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone**.\n        *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. This introduces a powerful activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n\n    v.  **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**.\n        *   This is the crucial step for regiocontrol. We are nitrating the ring. Let's look at the directors:\n            *   -NH₂ (at C4) is a powerful activator and directs ortho/para (to C3-occupied, C5).\n            *   -COCH₃ (at C1) is a deactivator and directs meta (to C5).\n            *   -Br (at C3) is a deactivator and directs ortho/para (to C2, C6).\n        *   Both the strongest activating group (-NH₂) and the -COCH₃ group direct the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This concerted direction ensures the reaction is regioselective and high-yield.\n\n    vi. **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO₂/HCl → Diazonium salt**.\n        *   The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n\n    vii. **Diazonium salt + H₃PO₂ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n        *   The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis entire sequence successfully constructs the target molecule with excellent control over the placement of the substituents, fulfilling the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (a benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution is crucial:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (by induction) but an ortho/para-director (by resonance).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider the most straightforward ways to introduce these three groups. The order of introduction is critical.\n\n*   **Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    i.   **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.** The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    ii.  **Acetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position (C3). This works well.\n    iii. **3-Nitroacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now the ring has a -COCH3 group at C1 and a -NO2 group at C3. Both are meta-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to C5. This is an excellent step, as the directors reinforce each other, leading to a high yield of the desired product.\n    *Conclusion:* This 3-step synthesis is logical and efficient. However, this sequence is not among the options provided. All options are 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex pathway is intended.\n\n*   **Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration** (This matches the beginning of Option A)\n    i.  **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.**\n    ii. **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs bromine to C3. This works.\n    iii. **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Now the ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho/para-director (-Br at C3). They compete. The -COCH3 group directs to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In such cases, the o,p-director usually determines the position of substitution, leading to a mixture of products, primarily nitration at C2, C4, and C6. The desired product (nitration at C5) would be a minor product. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nSince the straightforward routes are either not an option or do not provide a high yield, we must consider a more sophisticated strategy, likely one involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed. The presence of the `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, and `H3PO2` sequence in the options strongly points to the reduction of a nitro group to an amine, followed by diazotization and deamination (removal of the amino group). This is a classic strategy to achieve \"difficult\" substitution patterns.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze the options based on this understanding. We are looking for a logical sequence that uses a temporary amino group to correctly position the substituents and then removes it.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    As discussed, step (iii) gives a low yield. Furthermore, the sequence starting from step (iv) is illogical. It involves reducing the nitro group just added, then trying to nitrate the resulting highly reactive amine (which would be messy), and then removing a group. This pathway is flawed.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene (deamination with H3PO2). This is a futile loop that achieves nothing.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    This sequence starts by making p-bromonitrobenzene (major product). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring, which would fail or give an extremely low yield. This option is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    This sequence appears the most plausible, despite some ambiguously written steps which are common in such problems. Let's interpret it as a strategic synthesis:\n    i.  **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene.**\n    ii. **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline.**\n    iii. **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> p-Aminoacetophenone.** While Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline itself fails, these reagents can be used for a Fries Rearrangement of an initially formed N-acyl aniline, yielding p-aminoacetophenone as the major product. This strategically places the acetyl group on the ring, para to a powerful directing amino group.\n    iv. **p-Aminoacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone.** The powerful activating ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 will direct the incoming bromine to one of the ortho positions (C3 or C5).\n    v.  **3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone.** For this step to work cleanly, the amino group must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation). Let's assume this is implicit. The directing effects would then be: -NHAc (o,p at C4) directs to C5; -COCH3 (m at C1) directs to C5; -Br (o,p at C3) directs elsewhere (C2, C6). The reinforcing effects of the acetamido and acetyl groups strongly favor nitration at C5. The amino group would be deprotected afterwards.\n    vi. **3-Bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium salt.** The temporary amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium group.\n    vii. **Diazonium salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis detailed pathway, which uses the amino group at C4 as a temporary directing group, successfully constructs the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern and yields the final product. It is the only sequence that represents a coherent and effective (though complex) synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   The substituents are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe key to a high-yield synthesis is to introduce the groups in an order where their directing effects work together (are reinforcing) or at least do not conflict in a way that produces multiple isomers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → **Bromobenzene**.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene is treated with HNO3/H2SO4. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director. This will produce a mixture of *o*-bromonitrobenzene and *p*-bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n*   iii) The product from step ii (e.g., p-bromonitrobenzene) is treated with CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) makes the ring too electron-poor to undergo acylation. Therefore, this step would fail or give an extremely low yield. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitrobenzene**.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → **Aniline**. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   iii) Aniline is treated with CH3COCl/AlCl3. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that puts a positive charge on the nitrogen, strongly deactivating the ring and preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...**\n*   This sequence starts with:\n    *   i) Nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Reduction to aniline.\n    *   iii) Diazotization of aniline to benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   iv) Reduction of the diazonium salt with H3PO2 to remove the nitrogen group.\n*   The net result of steps i-iv is the conversion of benzene back into benzene. This sequence is nonsensical for synthesizing the target molecule. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   i) **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **Acetophenone**. This introduces the acetyl group (-COCH3). The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n*   ii) **Bromination:** Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to position 3. The major product will be 3-bromoacetophenone. This creates the desired 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   iii) **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. Let's look at the directing effects of the two existing groups:\n    *   The **-COCH3** group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, so it directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The **-Br** group at position 3 is an *ortho, para*-director. It directs the incoming -NO2 group to its ortho positions (positions 2 and 4) and its para position (position 6). However, considering the combined directing effects, the position that is *ortho* to Br and *meta* to COCH3 is position 5.\n    *   Both existing groups reinforce the directing of the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This leads to a high yield of the desired single product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) listed in option D are unnecessary as the target molecule has already been formed. They appear to be distractors. However, the initial three steps constitute a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis of the target product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, only the sequence starting with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration (the first three steps of option D) provides a viable and efficient route to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   Substituents are at positions 1 (-COCH3), 3 (-Br), and 5 (-NO2).\n*   The three substituents are all in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating, ortho,para-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n**Evaluation of a Direct Synthesis Route:**\nA simple, direct synthesis might be:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the -NO2 group to the meta position.\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In 3-nitroacetophenone, both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) are meta-directors. They cooperatively direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5.\n\nThis three-step synthesis is regiochemically correct. However, the final step (bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone) would be very slow and require harsh conditions because the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). This would not be a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The provided options are all seven steps long, suggesting a more complex, indirect route is necessary to achieve a good yield. Such routes often involve using a temporary directing group that is later modified or removed. The presence of reagents for reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) strongly points to the use of an amino group (-NH2) as a powerful ortho,para-directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this understanding.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These options start with the nitration of benzene, followed by reduction to form aniline. However, Option B proposes a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (iii), which is problematic as the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and making the reaction fail or give poor yields of the meta product. Option C proposes a sequence (i-iv) that converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene, which is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option D:** This option starts by making p-bromonitrobenzene (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of this product. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, and the nitro group is a very strong deactivator. Therefore, this step would fail, making Option D incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence appears to be the most chemically sound, employing the strategy of using a temporary directing group. Let's trace the steps carefully:\n\n    i) **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone**: Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n\n    ii) **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone**: The meta-directing acetyl group leads to bromination at the C3 position.\n\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**: This is a crucial step. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). The directing effects conflict. However, substitution is most likely at C4 (ortho to the o,p-director and meta to the m-director) and C6. Position 4 is generally favored. The product formed is 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone, which is the key intermediate for the next steps.\n\n    iv) **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone**: The nitro group is selectively reduced to a primary amine.\n\n    v) **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**: Now, a second nitration is performed. The powerful activating and ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 dictates the position of the new substituent. It directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position, C5 (C3 is already occupied). The other groups on the ring (-COCH3 and -Br) are also consistent with substitution at C5. This step has excellent regioselectivity.\n\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt formation**: The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n\n    vii) **Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**: The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination reaction). This leaves the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups in the desired 1,3,5-relationship.\n\nThis sequence is a clever and synthetically valid route that uses an amino group (generated from an initial nitro group) as a temporary directing group to install the final nitro group at the correct position with high selectivity, before being removed. This pathway would lead to a high yield of the target product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    To plan a synthesis, we must consider how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies:**\n    The main challenge is introducing the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at a position that is *meta* to the other two groups. This suggests that the order of reactions is critical.\n\n    Let's consider the final step of the synthesis. Which group should be added last?\n\n    *   **Case 1: Add the acetyl group last (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).**\n        The precursor would be 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This molecule contains two deactivating groups, one of which is the strongly deactivating nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions, including acylation, generally fail on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene and its derivatives. Therefore, this route is not feasible for a high-yield synthesis. The acetyl group must be introduced earlier.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Add the nitro group or the bromo group last.**\n        This means the synthesis must start with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene.\n        *   **Step 1: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone.\n            Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n            Now we have the acetyl group on the ring, which is a *meta*-director.\n\n        Now, we need to add the -Br and -NO2 groups to the meta positions (3 and 5). We have two choices for the next step: bromination or nitration.\n\n        *   **Path A: Brominate first, then nitrate.**\n            *   **Step 2a: Bromination.** Acetophenone is treated with Br2 and FeBr3. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine will be added at position 3.\n                Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n            *   **Step 3a: Nitration.** We now nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has an acetyl group (m-director) at position 1 and a bromo group (o,p-director) at position 3.\n                *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n                *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n                *   Both groups are deactivating. Electrophilic attack is generally disfavored at positions ortho to a deactivating group. Position 5 is meta to both substituents and is the least deactivated position. Therefore, nitration will predominantly occur at position 5.\n                3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule).\n                This sequence is chemically sound and known to produce the desired product in good yield.\n\n        *   **Path B: Nitrate first, then brominate.**\n            *   **Step 2b: Nitration.** Acetophenone is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the nitro group to position 3.\n                Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.\n            *   **Step 3b: Bromination.** We now brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring has two *meta*-directing groups at positions 1 (-COCH3) and 3 (-NO2). Both groups reinforce each other, directing the incoming bromo group to position 5.\n                3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule).\n                While this path also leads to the correct product, the ring in step 3b is more strongly deactivated (due to -NO2 being more deactivating than -Br) than the ring in step 3a. This would require harsher reaction conditions and likely result in a lower yield. Thus, Path A is the superior \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n4.  **Match the Best Strategy to the Given Options:**\n    The best synthesis route we identified is:\n    i) Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3)\n    ii) Bromination (Br2/FeBr3)\n    iii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    *   A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ... — Incorrect start.\n    *   B) **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4** ; iv) Fe/HCl ... — The first three steps perfectly match our optimal synthesis route. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are extraneous and would modify the target molecule, indicating a potential flaw in the question's construction. However, the initial sequence is the only one provided that correctly and efficiently leads to the desired product.\n    *   C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2... — This sequence starts by making benzene from benzene, which is incorrect.\n    *   D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... — This would lead to 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, and subsequent acylation would fail or give the wrong isomer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option B is the only choice that begins with the correct, high-yield sequence of reactions to produce 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Despite the superfluous steps listed afterward, the core of the synthesis presented is the most valid among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's identify its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are *meta* to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern). This is a key feature that will guide the synthesis strategy.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthetic Routes**\n\nA common strategy is to add the groups one by one. Let's consider the most logical direct route, even if it's not an option, to establish a baseline.\n\n*   **Route X (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination):**\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. (The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director).\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group directs the -NO2 group to the *meta* position).\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. (The ring now has two *meta*-directors: -COCH3 at position 1 and -NO2 at position 3. Both direct the incoming Br+ to position 5).\n\nThis three-step synthesis is highly regioselective and would produce the desired product. Although the final bromination step might be slow because the ring is deactivated by two groups, it is chemically sound. Since this sequence is not among the options, it implies a more complex route is required, likely one that circumvents potential issues like low reactivity or side reactions. The presence of reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl) and diazotization/deamination (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a strategy involving a temporary amino directing group.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   Step (i) gives nitrobenzene. Step (ii) gives aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a strongly deactivating complex (-NH2+AlCl3), which prevents the acylation of the ring. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   Step (i) gives bromobenzene. Step (ii) is the nitration of bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. This step produces a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, with only a tiny amount of the *meta* isomer (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene). This violates the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...\n    *   This sequence as written is nonsensical. Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally, H3PO2 removes the diazonium group, converting it back to benzene. This futile cycle makes the option incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    This sequence is long and complex, suggesting it might employ an advanced strategy. Let's analyze it step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation. (OK)\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** Bromination. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. (OK)\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone:** Nitration. Here we have competing directors: -COCH3 (*meta*) and -Br (*ortho, para*). The -Br group is less deactivating, so it primarily controls the position of substitution, directing the nitro group to its *ortho* and *para* positions. The major product would be the *ortho* isomer (relative to Br), 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone, as the other ortho position is sterically hindered. This step is regioselective for an intermediate, not the final product.\n    4.  **iv) 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone → 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone:** Reduction of the nitro group with Fe/HCl. (OK)\n    5.  **v) 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone → 3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone:** Nitration. This is the key step. The directing effects are:\n        *   -NH2 (at 4): A powerful activating *ortho, para*-director. It directs to position 5 (*ortho*).\n        *   -COCH3 (at 1): A *meta*-director. It directs to position 5.\n        *   -Br (at 3): An *ortho, para*-director.\n        The powerful activating -NH2 group, reinforced by the -COCH3 group, strongly directs the new nitro group to position 5. This step should be high-yield and highly regioselective (assuming conditions prevent full protonation of the amine).\n    6.  **vi) 3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazonium salt:** Diazotization of the amino group at position 4 with NaNO2/HCl. (OK)\n    7.  **vii) Diazonium salt → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Deamination (removal of the diazonium group) with H3PO2. Removing the group at position 4 leaves the acetyl (1), bromo (3), and nitro (5) groups in the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n\nThis sequence represents a sophisticated synthetic strategy where a nitro group is temporarily introduced, converted to a powerful amino directing group to control the placement of the final substituent, and then removed. Although complex, each step is logical and contributes to the high-yield synthesis of the specific isomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption B outlines a valid, albeit intricate, synthetic route that correctly manipulates directing group effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern in high yield. The other options contain fatal chemical flaws.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The desired product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n    All three substituents are *meta* to each other (positions 1, 3, 5).\n\n2.  **Analyze Substituent Directing Effects:**\n    In electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly electron-withdrawing, strongly deactivating, and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Electron-withdrawing (by induction) but electron-donating (by resonance), deactivating overall, and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Constraint:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acetylation using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) do not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO₂ group.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies:**\n    The goal is to add these three groups in an order that results in the 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n    *   **Strategy 1: Introduce a *meta*-director first.** This is the most logical approach to achieve a 1,3,5-pattern. We can start with either nitration or acetylation.\n        *   **Path A (Start with Nitration):** Benzene → Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a *meta*-director. However, the next step cannot be Friedel-Crafts acetylation because nitrobenzene is too deactivated. This path is not viable if we need to introduce the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts.\n        *   **Path B (Start with Acetylation):** Benzene → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a promising start. The ring is deactivated but can undergo further substitutions like nitration and bromination.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Start with the *ortho, para*-director.**\n        *   **Path C (Start with Bromination):** Benzene → Bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *o,p*-director. Subsequent nitration or acetylation would yield a mixture of *ortho* and *para* products, not the desired *meta* substitution pattern. This is an inefficient way to get to the 1,3,5 product.\n\n    Based on this initial analysis, starting with acetylation (Path B) is the most logical strategy.\n\n4.  **Develop the Synthesis from Acetophenone:**\n    Starting with acetophenone, we need to add a nitro group and a bromo group. We have two possible sequences:\n\n    *   **Sequence (i): Acetylation → Nitration → Bromination**\n        1.  `Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone`\n        2.  `Acetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Nitroacetophenone` (The -COCH₃ group directs the -NO₂ group to the meta position).\n        3.  `3-Nitroacetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one` (Now, both the -COCH₃ and -NO₂ groups are *meta*-directors, and they both direct the incoming Br⁺ to the 5-position. This reaction should have high regioselectivity, leading to a high yield of the desired isomer).\n\n    *   **Sequence (ii): Acetylation → Bromination → Nitration**\n        1.  `Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone`\n        2.  `Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone` (The -COCH₃ group directs the -Br group to the meta position).\n        3.  `3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one` (Here, we have conflicting directors. The -COCH₃ group directs *meta* (to position 5), while the -Br group directs *ortho* and *para* (to positions 2, 4, 6). While the 1,3,5-product is often major, other isomers can form, potentially lowering the yield).\n\n    Both sequences are plausible. Sequence (i) is theoretically better for a \"high-yield\" synthesis due to better control of regiochemistry in the final step. However, we must check which sequence is present in the options.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A)** i) Nitration... As discussed, FC-acetylation (vi) on a derivative of nitrobenzene would be problematic. Furthermore, a detailed analysis shows this route leads to the wrong isomer (4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone).\n    *   **B)** i) Nitration... ii) Reduction to aniline... This path leads to 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which is not the target product.\n    *   **C)** i) Bromination... ii) Nitration... This leads to *o,p*-products. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a deactivated ring (p-bromonitrobenzene), which will fail.\n    *   **D)** i) `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`; ii) `Br₂/FeBr₃`; iii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`... This matches **Sequence (ii)** described above. The first three steps constitute a valid synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical in this context (they appear to describe the reduction and then removal of the nitro group just added), suggesting a flawed question. However, the initial sequence is the only one among the options that correctly produces the desired compound.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The sequence of reactions starting with acetylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration (steps i, ii, and iii of option D) is a valid, if not perfectly ideal, method to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The other options either fail chemically or lead to incorrect products. Therefore, despite the erroneous later steps listed, option D contains the correct core synthesis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   The substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The numbering indicates the acetyl group is at position 1, the bromine is at position 3, and the nitro group is at position 5.\n*   This is a **1,3,5-substitution pattern**. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents direct new ones to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and **meta-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and **ortho, para-director**. It is formed by the reduction of a nitro group (e.g., with Fe/HCl).\n\nThe key challenge is the 1,3,5-pattern, especially with the presence of an ortho, para-director (-Br). A simple sequence of three electrophilic substitutions (acylation, bromination, nitration in any order) is unlikely to work because the directing effects will conflict at some point, leading to a mixture of isomers instead of a high-yield synthesis of the desired product.\n\nFor example, if we try the simple sequence of Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination:\n1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone\n2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 3-Nitroacetophenone (The meta-directing acetyl group works perfectly).\n3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, both the -COCH3 group and the -NO2 group are meta-directors, and they both direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This is a valid synthesis. However, this simple 3-step sequence is not among the options.\n\nThe provided options are all 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex strategy is required, likely involving functional group interconversions. The presence of reagents like `Fe/HCl` (reduction of NO2 to NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization of NH2), and `H3PO2` (deamination, i.e., replacement of a diazonium group with hydrogen) strongly suggests a \"placeholder amine\" strategy. This strategy uses an amino group to direct substituents to desired positions and is then removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options Using the Placeholder Amine Strategy**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step to see if it leads to the target molecule in high yield.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n    *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. This reaction fails on anilines because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring so strongly that acylation does not occur. Thus, sequence A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...`\n    *   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n    *   iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 -> Benzene. This sequence of steps just converts benzene back to benzene, making it an illogical and inefficient pathway. Thus, sequence B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene -> 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (The para isomer is the major product).\n    *   iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3: In this step, both -Br (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) direct the incoming acetyl group to the position ortho to Br and meta to NO2. The product would be 4-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone. This is not the correct isomer arrangement to lead to the final 1,3,5-product. Thus, sequence C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    Let's trace this path carefully:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at position 3.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone:** Here we have conflicting directors. The -Br at C3 is o,p-directing (to C2, C4, C6) and activating relative to the meta positions. The -COCH3 at C1 is m-directing (to C3, C5). The directing effect of the o,p-directing halogen is dominant, and nitration occurs primarily at the sterically accessible position para to the bromine, which is C4. This gives the desired intermediate for the next step.\n    4.  **iv) 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone:** The nitro group at C4 is reduced to an amino group.\n    5.  **v) 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone:** Now we nitrate this intermediate. This is the crucial directing step.\n        *   The powerful activating -NH2 group (at C4) directs ortho, to C3 and C5.\n        *   The -Br group (at C3) directs para, to C5.\n        *   The -COCH3 group (at C1) directs meta, to C3 and C5.\n        All three groups cooperate to direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This step proceeds with high regioselectivity.\n    6.  **vi) 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt formation:** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    7.  **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The deamination reaction removes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom. This removes the placeholder directing group.\n\nThe final product has the acetyl group at C1, bromine at C3, and nitro group at C5, which is exactly the target molecule. This sequence is chemically sound and all steps are regioselective or produce the required isomer as the major product, leading to a high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The desired product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n    *   It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    In electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing groups on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an *ortho,para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies:**\n    *   **Strategy 1: Sequential substitution on a ring with meta-directors.** A powerful strategy for getting a 1,3,5-pattern is to have two *meta*-directing groups on the ring, as they will both direct a third incoming group to the same position. For example, starting with 3-nitroacetophenone (-COCH3 at C1, -NO2 at C3), both groups would direct an incoming bromine to C5. This leads to the sequence:\n        1.  Acylation (to get acetophenone).\n        2.  Nitration (to get 3-nitroacetophenone).\n        3.  Bromination (to get the final product).\n        This logical sequence (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination) is not among the options.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Use of a temporary directing group.** Another common method for complex substitution patterns is to use a powerful directing group (like -NH2) to place other groups correctly, and then remove it via diazotization and deamination (e.g., using NaNO2/HCl followed by H3PO2). The presence of these reagents in the options suggests this strategy might be relevant.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2... This sequence starts with nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, diazotizing it, and then removing the diazonium group with H3PO2. This sequence of steps simply converts benzene back into benzene, making it incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...\n        *   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene.\n        *   ii) Bromobenzene -> 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene (this gives a mixture, with the 4-nitro isomer being major, but let's assume we get the meta product).\n        *   iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation on 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by two deactivating groups (-Br and especially -NO2). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D:** This is a long sequence involving deamination reagents. Let's trace it:\n        *   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline (reduction).\n        *   iii) Aniline -> Acetanilide (N-acylation to protect the amine).\n        *   iv) Acetanilide -> p-Bromoacetanilide (bromination occurs para to the activating -NHCOCH3 group).\n        *   v) p-Bromoacetanilide -> 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide (nitration is directed by the stronger activating -NHCOCH3 group to its ortho position).\n        *   The remaining steps (vi, vii) are for deamination. This would first require hydrolysis of the acetanilide to an aniline, and then removal of the -NH2 group. The final product of this entire pathway would be 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which is not the target ketone. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option A:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...\n        *   i) **Benzene -> Acetophenone:** Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n        *   ii) **Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The -COCH3 group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. This is a standard reaction.\n        *   iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone -> Nitration:** Now the ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). The directing effects are in conflict. -COCH3 directs to C5. -Br directs to C2, C4, C6. While this would typically produce a mixture of isomers, the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro product is among them. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are clearly non-viable, this path is the most plausible. The formation of the 1,3,5-isomer is often favored due to steric hindrance at the other possible positions (2, 4, and 6).\n        *   The subsequent steps (iv to vii) in option A are nonsensical if the target molecule is already formed in step (iii). They seem to be included as distractors.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing the options, Option A provides the most direct and chemically plausible route to the target molecule, despite the potential for side products in the nitration step. The other options contain fatal flaws, such as non-viable reactions or the synthesis of an incorrect final molecule. Therefore, Option A represents the best choice for a high-yield synthesis among the given sequences.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position 1: an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   At position 3: a bromine atom (-Br).\n*   At position 5: a nitro group (-NO2).\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing groups on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern is a key clue. To achieve this pattern with high yield, it's most efficient to have two *meta*-directing groups on the ring before introducing the third substituent. Both existing groups would then direct the new group to the same position.\n\nLet's try to build a logical sequence based on this principle:\n\n*   **Step 1: Introduce a *meta*-director.** We can start with either Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the -COCH3 group or nitration to add the -NO2 group. Friedel-Crafts acylation on nitrobenzene is very difficult, so it's better to do the acylation first.\n    *   **Reaction 1 (Acylation):** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is now on the ring. It is a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Step 2: Introduce the second *meta*-director.** The other *meta*-director we need is the nitro group.\n    *   **Reaction 2 (Nitration):** Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group at position 1 directs the incoming nitro group to position 3 (*meta*). This works well.\n\n*   **Step 3: Introduce the final group.** Now we have acetophenone with a -COCH3 group at position 1 and a -NO2 group at position 3. Both are *meta*-directors. We need to add a bromine atom.\n    *   -COCH3 (at C1) directs to C5.\n    *   -NO2 (at C3) directs to C5.\n    *   Since both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the same position (C5), this reaction will have high regioselectivity.\n    *   **Reaction 3 (Bromination):** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   Although the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, making the reaction slow, the directing effects are aligned, leading to a high yield of the desired isomer.\n\nThis logical three-step synthesis is: **Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's check which of the given options matches our logical synthesis, or comes closest to it. The provided options are complex, many involving reduction of a nitro group and subsequent diazotization/deamination (Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2), which is a roundabout way to remove a group. Such complexity is usually only necessary if a more direct route fails badly.\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with Nitration, then reduction to aniline, then tries Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This fails because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired reaction.\n\n*   **Option B:** The sequence of reaction types is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration → ...**.\n    1.  Benzene --(acylation)--> Acetophenone. (Good start)\n    2.  Acetophenone --(bromination)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone. (The acetyl group directs Br *meta*. This step works).\n    3.  3-Bromoacetophenone --(nitration)--> Product. This is the critical step. We have a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br). Their directing effects conflict. The -Br group directs to positions 4 and 6, while the -COCH3 group directs to position 5. The activating (ortho,para-directing) effect of the halogen usually dominates in these cases, leading to nitration at positions 4 and 6. The desired 5-nitro product would be a minor byproduct. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The subsequent steps are irrelevant as the key step fails to produce the correct intermediate in high yield.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with Bromination, then Nitration. This produces 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major) and 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (minor). The next step is Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings like nitro-halo-benzenes.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is problematic as written in most interpretations. For instance, one reading has the sequence Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzene (via deamination), which is circular and pointless. Another interpretation has a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which fails due to the strongly deactivating nitro group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the provided options contain significant chemical flaws:\n*   A, C, and D contain steps that are known to fail under standard conditions (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on strongly deactivated rings).\n*   B describes a sequence of reactions that are all possible, but a key step (nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone) has poor regioselectivity for the desired product, contradicting the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question where one answer must be correct, it's possible there is an error in the question itself. The most logical and effective synthesis is Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. Option B follows the sequence Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. It is the only option that starts with the correct first step and attempts to add the correct groups via electrophilic substitution, albeit in the wrong order for high yield. Given the catastrophic failures in the other options (reactions that do not proceed at all), Option B, despite its own flaw regarding yield, might be considered the \"best\" or intended answer, assuming a typo in the order of steps ii and iii. If we swap steps ii and iii in option B, we get the correct synthesis. No other option can be fixed so simply to yield a correct pathway.\n\nLet's re-examine Option B's steps: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2. Steps iv-vii seem extraneous and nonsensical after the target molecule would have been formed (in low yield) at step iii. This points to a poorly constructed question. However, if forced to choose, B's initial sequence of adding the three required functionalities is the most plausible starting point compared to the definite failures in other options.\n\nGiven the options, there appears to be an error in the question. However, if we must choose the most plausible sequence despite its flaws, B is the only one where the sequence of additions is conceptually close to a viable route, differing only by the order of the last two substitutions.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option B and the correct sequence is i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Br2/FeBr3. This corrected sequence is the most efficient and logical route. Therefore, B is the most likely intended answer, despite being written with an error.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The desired product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    The structure is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    Notice that all substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Consider the Properties of Substituents:**\n    We need to understand how each substituent affects subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions.\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    A crucial rule in organic synthesis is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**, such as those containing a nitro group (-NO2). This means the Friedel-Crafts acylation must be performed before the nitration step if both groups are on the ring, or on a ring that is not strongly deactivated.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Possible Synthetic Routes:**\n\n    *   **Can we add the acetyl group last?**\n        This would require performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This molecule has two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), with the nitro group being a strong deactivator. Therefore, the Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail. So, the acetyl group cannot be added last.\n\n    *   **The acetyl group must be added early.** This means the synthesis must start with the acylation of benzene.\n        **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n        Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n        This introduces the -COCH3 group, which is a *meta*-director.\n\n    *   **Now, what's the next step? Nitration or Bromination?**\n\n        *   **Path 1: Nitration first, then Bromination.**\n            *   **Step 2a: Nitration.** Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group directs the -NO2 group to the *meta* position).\n            *   **Step 3a: Bromination.** Now we brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring has two *meta*-directing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5. This reaction is regioselective and would yield the desired product. However, the ring is very strongly deactivated by two deactivating groups, so this reaction would be very slow and require harsh conditions.\n\n        *   **Path 2: Bromination first, then Nitration.**\n            *   **Step 2b: Bromination.** Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group directs the -Br group to the *meta* position).\n            *   **Step 3b: Nitration.** Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br).\n                *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n                *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n                *   Although the directing effects are conflicting, the position that is least deactivated will be substituted. Position 5 is *meta* to both groups. Positions 2, 4, and 6 are all *ortho* or *para* to one deactivating group. It has been experimentally shown that nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone gives the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in high yield. The deactivation of the ring is less severe than in Path 1 (since -Br is less deactivating than -NO2), making this reaction more feasible.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on the best pathway:** The sequence **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration** is a very effective and high-yield route to the target molecule.\n\n4.  **Match the Pathway with the Given Options:**\n    Let's look for the sequence: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3, ii) Br2/FeBr3, iii) HNO3/H2SO4.\n\n    *   **A)** Starts with nitration. Incorrect.\n    *   **B)** **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4** ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2.\n        The first three steps of this option perfectly match our derived optimal synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical if applied after the formation of the product and are likely included as distractors. The question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, which the first three steps of B accomplish with high yield.\n    *   **C)** Starts with bromination, leading to *o,p* substitution in the next step, which is not what we want. Friedel-Crafts also fails in step iii. Incorrect.\n    *   **D)** Starts with nitration, and the proposed acylation in step (iii) on aniline is problematic and leads to incorrect isomers upon bromination. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option that presents a viable, high-yield synthetic route at the beginning of its sequence is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a meta-meta relationship.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the existing substituents on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating and an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Key Constraints in Synthesis**\n\nA crucial rule in aromatic synthesis is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (acylation and alkylation) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**. Rings with substituents like -NO2, -SO3H, or -NR3+ are too deactivated for the reaction to proceed. This is a major constraint we must consider when evaluating the reaction sequences.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence step-by-step.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n    1.  **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.** The ring now has a strongly deactivating -NO2 group.\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.** The -NO2 group is reduced to an -NH2 group. Aniline is strongly activated.\n    3.  **Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Reaction Fails.** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempt on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3). This complex is extremely deactivating, preventing the acylation reaction on the ring. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...\n    1.  This sequence starts by nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, diazotizing it, and then removing the diazonium group with H3PO2.\n    2.  Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n    3.  These first four steps simply return the starting material, benzene. This is a nonsensical and inefficient pathway. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n    1.  **Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.** The ring has an ortho-, para-directing -Br group.\n    2.  **Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product) + o-Bromonitrobenzene.** The target molecule requires a meta relationship between the bromo and nitro groups. This step produces para and ortho isomers, not the required meta isomer.\n    3.  Even if we proceed, the next step is Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene. This ring has two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), making it strongly deactivated. The Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail.\n    Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This Friedel-Crafts acylation is performed on an activated benzene ring and works well. The product, acetophenone, has an acetyl group (-COCH3), which is a **meta-director**.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to the meta position (position 3). This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now we nitrate the ring which has two substituents:\n        *   The **-COCH3 group at position 1** is a **meta-director**, directing the new group to position 5.\n        *   The **-Br group at position 3** is an **ortho-, para-director**, directing the new group to positions 2, 4, and 5.\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This is a case of reinforcing directing effects, which leads to a clean reaction with a high yield of the desired product. The resulting molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence is chemically sound and is the most logical way to synthesize the target molecule with high yield and selectivity among the choices. The subsequent steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are unnecessary and would chemically alter the desired product into something else, suggesting a possible flaw in the question's construction. However, the initial sequence is the only viable path presented.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only sequence that correctly applies the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution to produce the desired 1,3,5-substituted product is the one starting with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration. This corresponds to the beginning of Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1.

Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   The substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The numbering indicates that if the acetyl group is at position 1, the bromo group is at position 3, and the nitro group is at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A meta-director and strongly deactivating.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** An ortho,para-director and weakly deactivating.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A meta-director and strongly deactivating.\n\n**3. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the order of reactions is crucial. We must consider the directing effects at each step.\n\nA critical constraint is the Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the -COCH3 group). This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. Therefore, the acylation step must be performed before nitration, or on a ring that is not strongly deactivated.\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this understanding.\n\n**Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Reduction gives aniline.\n*   iii) Diazotization gives a diazonium salt.\n*   iv) Deamination (reaction with H3PO2) removes the diazonium group, regenerating benzene. Steps i-iv are a long and pointless synthesis of benzene from benzene.\n*   Even if we ignore the first four steps and start from step v) with benzene -> bromobenzene.\n*   vi) Acylation of bromobenzene. The -Br group is an o,p-director, so this would yield a mixture of 2-bromoacetophenone and 4-bromoacetophenone, not the desired 3-bromo isomer.\n*   Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is Friedel-Crafts acylation. The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing the acylation reaction. The sequence is chemically flawed.\n*   Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4. The -Br group is an o,p-director, yielding a mixture of 2-bromonitrobenzene and 4-bromonitrobenzene. Neither has the required meta relationship.\n*   iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 on bromonitrobenzene. The ring is deactivated by both a bromo and a nitro group. Friedel-Crafts acylation under these conditions is not feasible.\n*   Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nLet's analyze the first three steps, which represent a complete synthesis pathway.\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The resulting acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This step is correct.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** At this stage, the ring has an acetyl group at C1 (meta-director, strong deactivator) and a bromo group at C3 (o,p-director, weak deactivator).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   The directing effects are conflicting. However, the position meta to the strongly deactivating group (C5) is the least deactivated position on the ring and is the major site of substitution. Thus, nitration occurs at C5 to yield the desired product.\n\nThis three-step sequence (i, ii, iii) successfully produces the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical as they would modify the already-formed product into something else. In the context of a multiple-choice question, it's common for incorrect options to be entirely wrong, while the correct option contains the right core sequence, even with extraneous or erroneous later steps. The initial sequence in Option D is the only chemically viable route among the choices provided to synthesize the target compound with high yield and correct regiochemistry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Weakly deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that we should introduce the substituents in an order that utilizes *meta*-directing effects.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n**Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction introduces the acetyl group, forming acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *Product: Acetophenone*\n\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination):** The acetyl group on the ring directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position.\n    *Product: 3-Bromoacetophenone*\n\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** We now have two groups on the ring: -COCH₃ (at C1) and -Br (at C3). We need to determine where the nitro group will go.\n    *   The -COCH₃ group is a strong deactivator and directs *meta* (to C5).\n    *   The -Br group is a weak deactivator and directs *ortho, para* (to C2, C4, C6).\n    *   The acetyl group strongly deactivates its ortho and para positions (C2, C4, C6). The bromine atom also deactivates the ring but directs incoming groups to these same positions. The position least deactivated is C5, which is meta to both existing substituents. Therefore, the powerful meta-directing and deactivating acetyl group will primarily direct the incoming nitro group to position C5.\n    *Product: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.* This is the target molecule.\n\nThe first three steps of this sequence successfully synthesize the desired product with high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical for this synthesis and appear to be extraneous. However, the initial part of the sequence is the most logical and correct pathway among all choices.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Nitration:** Forms nitrobenzene (-NO₂ is a *meta*-director).\n*   **Step ii) Reduction:** Forms aniline (-NH₂ is an *ortho, para*-director).\n*   **Step iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails on anilines because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a strongly deactivated anilinium complex. This path is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n\n*   **Steps i-iv:** This sequence is Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene. These steps form a futile cycle, returning to the starting material (benzene) before any of the target substituents are correctly placed. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Bromination:** Forms bromobenzene (-Br is an *ortho, para*-director).\n*   **Step ii) Nitration:** The -Br group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to the *ortho* and *para* positions. This produces a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. It does not produce the required 1-bromo-3-nitro- substitution pattern needed for the final product. This path is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence A provides a chemically sound and logical pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, specifically in its first three steps. The other options fail due to incorrect directing effects or chemically incompatible reactions. Despite the presence of superfluous and incorrect later steps, Option A is the only choice containing the correct synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis should prioritize introducing substituents under the influence of *meta*-directors. The presence of the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group needs careful strategic placement.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A-D)**\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step:\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (-NH2)\n    *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction **fails**. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring towards acylation. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene (Deamination reaction).\n    *   This sequence of reactions starts with benzene and returns to benzene after four steps, making it a pointless and inefficient pathway. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration): The bromo group is *ortho, para*-directing. This reaction would yield a mixture of *o*-bromonitrobenzene and *p*-bromonitrobenzene as the major products. It would not form the *meta* isomer needed to build the 1,3,5 pattern. Thus, Option C starts with an incorrect regiochemical step and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...\n    *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This produces **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This produces **1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one** (or m-bromoacetophenone). This step correctly sets up the 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **iii) 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Now we have two groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1, strong deactivator, *meta*-directing) and -Br (at C3, weak deactivator, *o,p*-directing).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        *   In cases of competing directors, the directing effect of the strongest deactivating group often dominates the regiochemistry, or the substitution occurs at a position that is electronically and sterically favorable. Position 5 is meta to both existing groups and is sterically accessible. Synthetically, this reaction is known to produce **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\nThe first three steps of Option D provide a chemically sound and direct route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv, v, vi, vii) are superfluous and would lead to a different product if carried out. However, among the given choices, Option D is the only one that contains a valid synthetic pathway to the desired product. It is common in such questions for the correct option to be the one whose initial sequence is correct.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in option D is the most plausible route.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the ring are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The key feature is the substitution pattern: all three groups are *meta* to each other (1,3,5 substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing groups on the benzene ring direct new groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. (Relevant for intermediates in some options).\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it can logically produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **Sequence A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene:** Nitration of benzene. The -NO2 group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene -> Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group (-NH2). The -NH2 group is strongly activating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n    3.  **Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This step is highly problematic. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings with strongly activating groups like -NH2. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivating complex (-N+H2-AlCl3), which prevents the desired reaction on the ring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence B:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Bromobenzene:** Bromination of benzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  **Bromobenzene -> o/p-Bromonitrobenzene:** Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with the para isomer (4-bromonitrobenzene) being the major one. This does not lead to a *meta* relationship between Br and NO2.\n    3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts acylation on this ring is very difficult because it is strongly deactivated by both the -Br and -NO2 groups. Even if it worked, the directing effects would not lead to the 1,3,5 pattern. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene**\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene -> Aniline**\n    3.  **Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride:** Diazotization of aniline.\n    4.  **Benzenediazonium chloride -> Benzene:** Reduction of the diazonium salt with H3PO2 removes the group entirely, regenerating the starting material, benzene. This sequence is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Sequence D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product is acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is an electrophilic bromination. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine atom is added at the meta position (position 3). This step is correct.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is an electrophilic nitration on 3-bromoacetophenone. We must consider the directing effects of both substituents:\n        *   The -COCH3 group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, directing the new -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group at position 3 is an *ortho, para*-director, directing the new group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        At first glance, the directors seem to conflict. However, the -COCH3 group is a strong deactivator, making the positions *ortho* and *para* to it (positions 2, 4, 6) very unreactive. The least deactivated position on the ring is position 5 (meta to the strong deactivator). Therefore, the nitration occurs preferentially at position 5, yielding the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This reaction is known to proceed with a good yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence D provide a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are superfluous and would modify the desired product if carried out, but the question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the product. This implies that the correct path is contained within the option.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence D correctly outlines the steps to first install a *meta*-director (acetyl group), then use it to direct the second substituent (bromo group) to the meta position, and finally, perform a third substitution (nitration) which is directed to the only remaining favorable position to give the 1,3,5-trisubstituted product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key structural feature is that all three substituents are **meta** (in a 1,3,5 relationship) to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent influences the position of subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitutions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Deactivating (strongly) and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nSynthesizing a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring is challenging, especially when one of the substituents is an ortho, para-director (-Br) and the other two are meta-directors (-COCH3, -NO2). A direct sequence of electrophilic substitutions is unlikely to work efficiently.\n*   If we try to add the three groups directly, their directing effects will conflict. For example, if we have a 1,3-disubstituted ring with a meta-director and an o,p-director, the third substituent will likely lead to a mixture of products.\n*   Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH3 group) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. This means the acylation step must happen before nitration, or an alternative strategy is needed.\n\nThe presence of steps like reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a more sophisticated strategy involving the use of a temporary amino group (-NH2) to control the regiochemistry. The amino group can be introduced by reducing a nitro group, and it can be removed completely after it has served its directing purpose.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace each proposed reaction sequence.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\nii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → A mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene.\niii) Product from (ii) + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a nitro-substituted benzene ring. The reaction is extremely slow or fails due to the strong deactivating effect of the nitro group. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\nii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\niii) Aniline → Diazonium salt\niv) Diazonium salt → Benzene (deamination). This sequence just regenerates the starting material, benzene, and then proceeds with further reactions on it, which is nonsensical. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\niii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. If it were to proceed, it would likely yield the meta product (3-aminoacetophenone), but it's not a standard, high-yield reaction. Assuming it works and gives 3-aminoacetophenone:\niv) 3-aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → The powerful activating -NH2 group directs ortho/para. Under acidic conditions (FeBr3 is a Lewis acid), the amine is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The -COCH3 group is also a meta-director. Starting with substituents at C1 and C3, both direct to C5. So we would get 3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone.\nv) Nitration of 3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has three substituents: -NH3+ (meta), -Br (o,p), and -COCH3 (meta). The ring is extremely deactivated by two strong deactivators (-NH3+, -COCH3) making this nitration step very difficult, if not impossible. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option A:**\nThis sequence employs the strategy of using a temporary group to control regiochemistry.\ni) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **Acetophenone**. (This adds the acetyl group early, avoiding issues with Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring).\nii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. (The acetyl group is a meta-director, so this step is regioselective).\niii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitration**. Here, the directing effects conflict (-COCH3 is meta, -Br is o,p). This will produce a mixture of isomers, primarily 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone. Crucially, the synthesis does not require this step to be selective. Let's call the product mixture **Isomer Mix**.\niv) Isomer Mix + Fe/HCl → **Reduction**. The nitro group in all isomers is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). We now have a mixture of 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone and 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone. Let's call this **Amino Mix**.\nv) Amino Mix + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Second Nitration**. This is the key step.\n    *   In 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful activating -NH2 group (at C4) and the meta-directing -COCH3 group (at C1) both strongly direct the incoming -NO2 group to **position 5**.\n    *   In 6-amino-3-bromoacetophenone, the powerful activating -NH2 group (at C6) and the meta-directing -COCH3 group (at C1) both strongly direct the incoming -NO2 group to **position 5**.\n    This step is highly regioselective for both components of the mixture, yielding a mix of 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone and 6-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. The desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern is now established.\nvi) Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → **Diazotization**. The amino group (-NH2) in both isomers is converted to a diazonium salt group (-N2+).\nvii) Product from (vi) + H3PO2 → **Deamination**. The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Removing the group at C4 from the first isomer leaves substituents at C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   Removing the group at C6 from the second isomer also leaves substituents at C1, C3, and C5.\n    Both paths converge to the same final product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis synthetic route is elegant because it doesn't rely on a difficult separation or a selective reaction in step (iii). Instead, it uses the initial nitro group as a \"sacrificial\" directing group that is later removed, ensuring a high overall yield of the final target molecule.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in Option A is the correct and most effective pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   There are three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents direct new ones to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Analyze Key Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (adding -COCH3):** This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings. A ring with a -NO2 group is too deactivated. It also does not work on rings with an -NH2 group (aniline) because the amine is a Lewis base that reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst.\n*   **1,3,5-Substitution:** To achieve this pattern, we generally need to use *meta*-directing groups to guide the substitutions, or use a \"placeholder\" group that can be modified or removed later (e.g., via a Sandmeyer reaction sequence).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is attached to the ring. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is an electrophilic bromination. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This successfully creates a 1,3 substitution pattern.\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is nitration. We now have two groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1, a *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, an *ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Although the directing effects are conflicting, the position meta to both groups (C5) is the least deactivated overall. The reaction is known to proceed with good yield to form the 1,3,5-substituted product. **At this point, the target molecule has been synthesized.**\n*   The remaining steps (iv-vii) seem extraneous and chemically flawed (e.g., nitrating a sensitive aniline derivative), but the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target product.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **Step iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride**\n*   **Step iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene:** This sequence of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) results in converting benzene back into benzene. This pathway is nonsensical.\n\n**Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product):** The -Br group is *ortho, para*-directing, with the *para* product favored.\n*   **Step iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group. **This reaction will fail.** Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **Step iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempted on aniline. The lone pair of the -NH2 group (a Lewis base) will react with the AlCl3 catalyst (a Lewis acid), deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. **This reaction will fail.** Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A contains a chemically sound and logical pathway to the target molecule. The sequence of acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to build the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The first three steps of Option A represent the most effective synthesis among the choices. The superfluous steps at the end are likely an error in the question's formulation, but they do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   Let's assign the acetyl group (-COCH₃) to position 1.\n*   The bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n*   The nitro group (-NO₂) is at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nThe order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring is crucial, as each group directs the next incoming group to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director** due to its lone pairs participating in resonance.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nWe need to find a sequence that logically leads to the 1,3,5 substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromobenzene. The bromo group is an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Step ii):** Bromobenzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → This will produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major). Neither of these has the required meta-relationship for building the final product. This pathway will not lead to a high yield of the target.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta-director.\n*   **Step ii):** Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline. This reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH₂), which is a strong activating group and an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Step iii):** Aniline + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts acylation) → This reaction does not work as intended. The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex. This complex deactivates the ring so strongly that the Friedel-Crafts acylation of the ring fails.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect due to a fundamentally flawed step.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii):** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   **Step iii):** Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization).\n*   **Step iv):** Benzenediazonium chloride + H₃PO₂ → Benzene (deamination).\n*   This sequence of reactions converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. It is a pointless loop and does not lead to the desired product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n*   **Step i):** Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone. This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a meta-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **Step ii):** Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine will be directed to the meta position (C3). This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   **Step iii):** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration. Now we must place the nitro group.\n    *   The ring has two substituents: -COCH₃ (at C1, meta-director) and -Br (at C3, ortho, para-director).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The directing effects are in conflict. However, in such cases, we must also consider steric hindrance and the relative deactivating strengths. The positions ortho to the substituents (2 and ortho-part of 6) are sterically hindered. A detailed analysis shows that the least disfavored position is C5. Therefore, nitration occurs at position 5, yielding **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, the desired product. This pathway is known to produce the target compound as the major product.\n*   **Steps iv) to vii):** These subsequent steps (reduction, nitration, diazotization, deamination) would modify and ultimately destroy the target molecule that was already successfully synthesized in step iii. These steps appear to be extraneous and are likely an error in the question's formatting. However, the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence D provides a viable synthetic route to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in its initial steps. The other options fail due to incorrect directing effects or incompatible reactions. Despite the superfluous final steps listed in option D, it is the only choice that correctly describes how to build the molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Parent:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Structure and Directing Effects:**\n    *   The substituents are all in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n    *   -COCH3 is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   -NO2 is a strong deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   -Br is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider adding the three groups directly to benzene.\n*   **Problem:** It's very difficult to add three groups in a 1,3,5-pattern when they don't all direct to the same places. More importantly, Friedel-Crafts reactions, like the acylation needed to add the -COCH3 group (CH3COCl/AlCl3), fail on strongly deactivated rings. If we add the -NO2 and -Br groups first, the ring becomes too deactivated for the final acylation step.\n*   **Route 1:** Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. (OK)\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group is a meta-director, so this works well).\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → Target. (The -COCH3 and -NO2 groups are both meta-directors. They both direct the incoming Br+ to position 5. The regiochemistry is perfect).\n*   **Potential Flaw:** The final bromination step is performed on a ring with two deactivating groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). This makes the ring very unreactive towards electrophilic substitution. While the selectivity is good, the reaction rate is very low, and standard conditions (Br2/FeBr3) give very poor yields (reported as ~11%). Achieving a \"high-yield\" requires very harsh, specific conditions not implied by the question's reagents. Therefore, this simple route is likely not the intended answer for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate Indirect Synthesis Routes (The \"Amino Group\" Strategy)**\n\nThe presence of reagents for reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a more sophisticated strategy. This strategy involves:\n1.  Introducing an amino group (-NH2), usually from a nitro group.\n2.  Using the powerful ortho, para-directing effect of the amino group (or its protected form, acetamido -NHCOCH3) to place other substituents.\n3.  Removing the amino group via diazotization and deamination.\n\nThis is a classic method for synthesizing substitution patterns that are otherwise inaccessible.\n\n**4. Analyze the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace each option to see if it follows a logical path to the target.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    *   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 is a meta-director).\n    *   iii) Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone. Here, -COCH3 directs to position 5, but -Br (an o,p-director) directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The directors are in conflict, which will lead to a mixture of products, not a high-yield synthesis of the desired isomer. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n    *   This sequence just returns to the starting material, benzene. This is a pointless loop. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n    *   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of p-Bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both -Br and -NO2 groups. This reaction fails. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's see if we can find a plausible (though complex) path that matches these reagents. The overall strategy must be the amino-group-directed synthesis. A successful, high-yield synthesis is as follows:\n    1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline.** (Matches steps **i** and **ii**).\n    2.  **Aniline → p-Aminoacetophenone.** This is a complex transformation. A possible way is protecting the aniline as acetanilide, performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation (which gives the para product), and then deprotecting. Let's assume the single step **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3** is a shorthand for this entire process of getting the acetyl group onto the ring para to the amino group. The product is 4-aminoacetophenone.\n    3.  **4-aminoacetophenone → 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone.** This is step **iv) Br2/FeBr3**. The directing effects are checked: The strong o,p-directing -NH2 group and the m-directing -COCH3 group both direct bromination to position 3. This is a reinforcing effect and works well.\n    4.  **4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.** This is step **v) HNO3/H2SO4**. For this to work in high yield, the powerful -NH2 group must direct the nitration to position 5 (ortho to itself). This requires non-acidic conditions to avoid protonating the amine to the meta-directing -NH3+. Assuming such conditions are implied, this step is plausible.\n    5.  **4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazotize the -NH2 group.** This is step **vi) NaNO2/HCl**. This is the standard reaction.\n    6.  **Diazonium salt → Deamination (remove the N2+ group).** This is step **vii) H3PO2**. Removing the directing group at position 4 leaves the acetyl group at C1, the bromo group at C3, and the nitro group at C5. This yields the target product.\n\n    While the description of steps (iii) and (v) in option A is imprecise, the overall sequence of transformations represents a valid and high-yield synthetic strategy for this challenging target molecule. The other options contain fundamental flaws (failed reactions, incorrect regiochemistry, pointless loops). Therefore, Option A is the best choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   Bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   Nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions:\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n### 3. Key Chemical Principles to Consider\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (and Alkylation):** These reactions (like adding the -COCH₃ group) do not work on strongly deactivated rings, particularly those bearing a nitro group (-NO₂). This is a critical constraint.\n*   **Order of Reactions:** The order in which substituents are introduced is crucial for achieving the correct isomer.\n*   **Conflicting Directing Effects:** When multiple substituents are present, their directing effects must be considered together. Often, the most strongly activating group dominates, or in the case of multiple deactivating groups, the reaction occurs at the least deactivated position.\n*   **Diazotization-Deamination Sequence:** A sequence involving reduction of a nitro group to an amine (e.g., with Fe/HCl), followed by diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) and deamination (H₃PO₂), is used to remove an amino group. This is often employed as a strategy to overcome unfavorable directing effects by using the amino group as a temporary \"phantom\" director. However, in this case, the final product contains all meta-directing groups (or an o,p-director meta to the others), so such a complex route may not be the most straightforward.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride.\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (Deamination).\nThis sequence brings the starting material back to benzene after four steps, making the entire sequence illogical for synthesizing a complex product. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene. (-Br is o,p-director).\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product). The ring now has a -Br and a -NO₂ group.\n*   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).\nThis step is the fatal flaw. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, and Friedel-Crafts acylation will not proceed under normal conditions. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ...**\nLet's trace this path carefully.\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → This reaction would primarily result in N-acylation to form acetanilide, not a Friedel-Crafts reaction on the ring. The basic nitrogen atom complexes with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring.\n*   If we assume acetanilide is formed, step (iv) would be bromination to yield p-bromoacetanilide. Following the entire sequence (which includes nitration and a missing hydrolysis step before diazotization/deamination) leads to 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which is not the target molecule. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\nLet's analyze the sequence of reactions:\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product, acetophenone, has a meta-directing acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This is a standard electrophilic bromination on a moderately deactivated ring.\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n    *   In 3-bromoacetophenone, we have a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an o,p-director (-Br at C3).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   However, the acetyl group is a stronger deactivator than the bromo group. It strongly deactivates its ortho and para positions (2, 4, 6). Therefore, the electrophilic attack is most likely to occur at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl group and least deactivated.\n    *   This reaction is known to produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in high yield.\n\nThe first three steps of option B constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) would modify the product and seem superfluous, likely an error in the question's formulation. However, compared to the other options which contain fundamental chemical errors (impossible reactions, wrong products, illogical sequences), the core synthesis presented in option B is correct. Therefore, it is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThis problem asks for the best sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene in high yield.\n\nLet's first analyze the target molecule. The structure is:\n```\n      COCH3\n      /\n    (C1)\n   /   \\\n(C6)   (C2)\n|       |\n(C5)---(C4)---(C3)\n \\     /\n  NO2 Br\n```\nThe substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This is a meta, meta substitution pattern.\n\nWe need to evaluate the directing effects of these substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and a meta-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly electron-withdrawing, strongly deactivating, and a meta-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Electron-withdrawing by induction but electron-donating by resonance, overall weakly deactivating, and an ortho, para-director.\n\nA critical rule for synthesis is that Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) do not work on strongly deactivated benzene rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. They also fail with amines like aniline because the amine's lone pair coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3).\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction)\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization)\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination)\nThe first four steps start with benzene and return to benzene, which is an inefficient and pointless sequence. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene. (-Br is an o,p-director).\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → A mixture of p-bromonitrobenzene (major) and o-bromonitrobenzene (minor).\n*   iii) Now, we attempt a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on bromonitrobenzene. The presence of the strongly deactivating nitro group (-NO2) on the ring prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction from occurring. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Now, we attempt a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction fails because the nitrogen atom of the amino group acts as a Lewis base and coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a strongly deactivating ammonium salt (-NH2+-AlCl3), which shuts down the electrophilic substitution on the ring. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\nLet's analyze the sequence of reactions step-by-step.\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.**\n    This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product is acetophenone, which has an acetyl group (-COCH3) on the ring. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n    The acetyl group directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. This gives 3-bromoacetophenone. Now we have an acetyl group at C1 and a bromo group at C3.\n\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n    This is the crucial step. We are nitrating a ring with two substituents: -COCH3 (meta-director) at C1 and -Br (ortho,para-director) at C3.\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C5.\n    *   The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n    At first glance, the directing effects seem to conflict. However, we must analyze the stability of the intermediate sigma complex (Wheland intermediate) for substitution at each possible position.\n    *   **Substitution at C5:** The positive charge in the intermediate is delocalized over C2, C4, and C6. None of these positions force the positive charge onto C1 or C3, which bear the electron-withdrawing groups. In fact, the resonance (+M) effect of the bromine atom can help stabilize the positive charge when it's at C2, C4, and C6. This is a favorable pathway.\n    *   **Substitution at any other position (C2, C4, or C6):** The formation of the sigma complex would involve resonance structures where the positive charge is placed directly on C1, the carbon atom attached to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group. Such a structure is extremely high in energy and strongly disfavored.\n    Therefore, substitution occurs almost exclusively at C5, leading to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, in high yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence B provide a valid, high-yield route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are extraneous and would modify the product if carried out, suggesting a possible flaw in the question's construction. However, among the given choices, option B is the only one that contains a chemically sound and high-yield synthetic pathway to the target molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent is benzene.\n*   The substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. This means all three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, ortho,para-directing.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-directing. Can be converted to a meta-directing -NH3+ group in strong acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate the General Strategy**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern is crucial.\n*   A simple approach would be to install two meta-directing groups, which would then direct a third substituent to the position between them (position 5). For example, brominating 3-nitroacetophenone. Both -COCH3 and -NO2 are meta-directors and would direct Br to the 5-position. However, the ring would be extremely deactivated, making the reaction very difficult and likely low-yield.\n*   A more sophisticated strategy, often required for complex substitution patterns, is to use a \"placeholder\" directing group (like -NH2) that can be modified or removed later. The presence of diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and deamination (H3PO2) reagents in the options strongly suggests such a strategy is intended. The sequence Ar-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Ar-N2+ --(H3PO2)--> Ar-H removes an amino group.\n\n**4. Analyze Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) Nitration -> Nitrobenzene. ii) Reduction -> Aniline. iii) Acylation of Amine -> Acetanilide. iv) Bromination -> p-Bromoacetanilide. v) Nitration -> 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide. vi) Hydrolysis (implicit) and Diazotization -> 4-bromo-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt. vii) Deamination -> **1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene**. This is not the target molecule as it lacks the acetyl group.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) Nitration -> Nitrobenzene. ii) Reduction -> Aniline. iii) Diazotization -> Benzenediazonium chloride. iv) Deamination -> **Benzene**. This sequence is a pointless loop that returns to the starting material.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) Bromination -> Bromobenzene. ii) Nitration -> p-Bromonitrobenzene. iii) Acylation (Friedel-Crafts) -> This reaction is very difficult on a ring deactivated by both -Br and -NO2. Assuming it works and gives the reinforced product (2-acetyl-4-bromonitrobenzene, i.e., 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone), the next step is (iv) Nitration. Nitrating a ring with three deactivating groups is extremely difficult. If we follow the whole sequence, it leads to **3-bromoacetophenone**, not the target.\n\n*   **Option D:** Let's trace this path carefully.\n    i) **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone.**\n       (-COCH3 is a meta-director).\n    ii) **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n       (Acylation is followed by bromination, which is directed to the meta position).\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Intermediate.**\n       Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone gives a mixture of isomers. For this synthetic route to be viable, we need to form an isomer that can lead to the final product. Let's assume we form and isolate **3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**. (This isomer results from ortho-direction by the bromo group).\n    iv) **3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl -> 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone.**\n       (The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amino group).\n    v) **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.**\n       This is a critical step. We are nitrating an aniline derivative. The amino group (-NH2) is a very strong ortho,para-director and will control the substitution. Its ortho position is C5 and its para position (C1) is blocked. The acetyl group (-COCH3) also directs meta to C5. Therefore, nitration occurs regioselectively at C5. While aniline nitration can be complex in strong acid, the directing effects strongly favor the required C5 isomer.\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl -> ...diazonium salt.**\n       (The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt).\n    vii) **...diazonium salt + H3PO2 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n       (The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination). Removing the group at C4 leaves the acetyl group at C1, the bromo group at C3, and the nitro group at C5).\n\nThis sequence successfully constructs the target molecule with the correct 1,3,5-substitution pattern. It cleverly uses an amino group as a director, which is later removed to achieve a substitution pattern that would be difficult to obtain by direct electrophilic substitution alone.\n\nTherefore, sequence D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. This involves planning a multi-step synthesis, paying close attention to the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe key to designing the synthesis is to introduce the groups in an order that utilizes their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern. Since all groups are *meta* to each other, a good strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-director, and then add the other substituents.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Step ii: Bromobenzene → Nitration. The -NO2 group will be directed to the *ortho* and *para* positions. The major product is p-bromonitrobenzene (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene). This 1,4-substitution pattern is incorrect for building a 1,3,5-substituted product. This sequence will not lead to the desired product in high yield.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction).\n*   Step iii & iv: Aniline → Diazonium salt → Benzene (deamination).\n*   This sequence converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene. It does not lead to the target molecule. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   Step iii: Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction fails. The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents the acylation reaction. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\nLet's analyze the crucial first three steps:\n*   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group (-COCH3). This is an excellent first step because the acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n*   **Step ii: Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** This is an electrophilic bromination. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (C3), giving the desired 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** This is an electrophilic nitration. We now have two groups on the ring: -COCH3 at C1 (*meta*-director) and -Br at C3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   In cases of conflicting directors, we analyze the positions. Position C5 is meta to the strong deactivating -COCH3 group. Positions C4 and C6 are ortho/para to the -Br group. While a mixture might be expected, the directing effect of the acetyl group is strong, and nitration at C5 is the major pathway, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This route correctly installs all three substituents with the correct 1,3,5-regiochemistry.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) in option B appear to be nonsensical and would not be performed after the target molecule has already been synthesized in step iii. They are likely included as distractors or are an error in the question. However, the initial sequence of reactions (i, ii, iii) is the only chemically sound and high-yield pathway to the target molecule among the choices.\n\nTherefore, the sequence beginning with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration is the correct approach.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a derivative of benzene.\n*   It has three substituents on the ring.\n*   The parent structure is ethan-1-one attached to a phenyl group, which is acetophenone. The acetyl group (`-COCH3`) is at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (`-Br`) is at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (`-NO2`) is at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are **meta** (1,3,5) relative to each other. This substitution pattern is key to devising the synthesis, as it depends heavily on the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider the directing effects of the groups we will introduce or have as intermediates:\n*   **Acetyl group (`-COCH3`):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (`-Br`):** Weakly deactivating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (`-NO2`):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (`-NH2`):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director** (often appears as an intermediate).\n\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-trisubstituted product, the directing effects of the groups on the ring must align correctly during the substitution steps. The best strategy is often to introduce groups that direct an incoming substituent to the desired position.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways (The Options)**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction)\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization)\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination with H3PO2)\nThis sequence of the first four steps converts benzene back into benzene, which makes no sense for a synthesis. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline + `CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction does not work. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a strongly deactivated complex (`-NH2+-AlCl3`) that prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction. If N-acylation (amide formation) were intended, it would lead to acetanilide, which upon bromination and nitration yields 1,2,4-substituted products, not the desired 1,3,5 pattern. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n*   ii) Bromobenzene + `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration): The bromo group is an o,p-director, so this step yields a mixture of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major) and 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (minor).\n*   iii) `1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene` + `CH3COCl/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction fails. The benzene ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, preventing Friedel-Crafts acylation. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nLet's analyze this sequence.\n*   **i) Benzene + `CH3COCl/AlCl3` → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation and works well. The product has an acetyl group (`-COCH3`), which is a meta-director.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + `Br2/FeBr3` → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. This reaction provides the desired 1,3-disubstituted product.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + `HNO3/H2SO4` → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents:\n    *   `-COCH3` (at C1) is a meta-director, directing the nitro group to position 5.\n    *   `-Br` (at C3) is an o,p-director, directing the nitro group to positions 2, 4, 6 (relative to the acetyl group).\n    While the directing effects conflict, nitration at position 5 is a significant outcome. Experimental evidence confirms that 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one is the major product of this reaction, which can be isolated in reasonable yield (e.g., ~60%) after recrystallization. This sequence of the first three steps successfully generates the target molecule.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) in option D seem chemically nonsensical for synthesizing the target. They appear to take the desired product, reduce the nitro group (iv), attempt another nitration (v), and then perform a diazotization-deamination sequence (vi, vii). This would destroy the product. It is highly likely that these steps are erroneously included in the option. However, compared to options A, B, and C which fail on fundamental principles (non-working reactions or incorrect regiochemistry), the initial sequence of D is the only viable path presented that leads to the target molecule. In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"best\" option, which is the one that contains a valid synthetic route, even if it has extraneous or incorrect parts.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy elimination and analysis of the initial, critical steps, option D provides the only plausible route to the desired product among the choices. The first three steps constitute a known, if not perfectly high-yield, synthesis. The other options are fundamentally flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means all substituents are **meta** to each other.\n\n### 2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nThe order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring is critical. This is governed by the directing effects of the substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) reactions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Important Reaction Rule:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) do not work on strongly deactivated rings, especially those containing a nitro group (-NO₂). This means the **acylation step must be performed before the nitration step**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option based on these principles.\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n*   i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n*   iii) Diazotization of aniline gives benzenediazonium chloride.\n*   iv) Reaction with H₃PO₂ reduces the diazonium salt, removing the group entirely and regenerating benzene. This sequence makes no sense as it brings you back to the starting material. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n*   i) Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene. The -Br group is an o,p-director.\n*   ii) Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (ortho) and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (para), with the para product being major. Neither has the 1,3-relationship needed.\n*   iii) Acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene would be the next step. This Friedel-Crafts reaction will **fail** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n*   i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   iii) The next EAS step shown is Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) on a product derived from nitrobenzene. As established, FC acylation fails on nitrobenzene. This option is incorrect from the start. (Even if we consider the intermediate steps of reduction to aniline, the pathway does not lead to the desired product, as acylation would then occur on the amine or its complex with AlCl₃, leading to different isomers).\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...**\nLet's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n*   **i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction works well to produce **acetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a **meta-director**.\n     \n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br⁺) to the meta position. This correctly forms **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n     \n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** We now nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents:\n    *   -COCH₃ at C1 (meta-director, directs to C5).\n    *   -Br at C3 (ortho, para-director, directs to C2, C4, C6).\n    The acetyl group is a moderate deactivator, and its meta-directing effect to the open position (C5) is strong. The bromo group directs elsewhere. In this case, the directing effects combine favorably, and the major product is indeed **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, the desired target molecule, in high yield.\n     \n\nThe first three steps of this sequence provide a viable, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv-vii) in the option are extraneous and would modify the product in undesirable ways, but the core synthetic route presented at the beginning of this option is the correct one. Among the choices given, this is the only one that presents a chemically sound pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) is at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) is at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nWe need to consider the directing effects of each group in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), which is the primary way to add groups to a benzene ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃)**: Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂) C**: Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br)**: Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis likely relies on the presence of meta-directing groups to guide subsequent substitutions.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies\n\nLet's devise a logical synthesis based on these directing effects and then compare it with the given options. The key is the order in which the three groups are added.\n\n*   **Strategy A: Introduce the acetyl group first.**\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    2.  **Add the second group (e.g., Bromine):** Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position.\n    3.  **Add the third group (Nitro):** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's analyze the directing effects in this step:\n        *   The acetyl group at C1 is meta-directing, so it directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n        *   The bromo group at C3 is ortho,para-directing. It directs the incoming nitro group to positions C2, C4, and C6. The C5 position is *not* favored by bromine's directing effect. However, a position ortho to a halogen is often still reactive enough, and the combined influence is key. Let's consider another permutation.\n\n*   **Strategy B: Introduce acetyl, then nitro, then bromo.**\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs nitration to the meta position.\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n        *   The acetyl group at C1 is a meta-director, directing the incoming bromine to C5.\n        *   The nitro group at C3 is also a meta-director, directing the incoming bromine to C5.\n        *   Since both existing groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) to the same C5 position, this step should be highly regioselective and lead cleanly to the desired product. The only drawback is that the ring is heavily deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, so the reaction might be slow.\n\n*   **Strategy C (same as A, just swapping Br and NO2 addition order): Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n        *   The acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) directs nitration to C5.\n        *   The bromo group at C3 (ortho,para-director) directs to C2, C4, and C6. Position 5 is *ortho* to the bromine.\n        *   Here, both groups' directing effects align to favor position 5 (meta to acetyl, ortho to bromo). This is a strong indication that this pathway will give a high yield of the desired product.\n\nBoth strategies B and C seem chemically sound. Let's examine the options to see which one matches.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Given Options\n\nThe options provide a fixed sequence of 7 reactions. We need to find the one that correctly produces the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration); ii) Fe/HCl (Reduction); iii) NaNO₂/HCl (Diazotization); iv) H₃PO₂ (Deamination). This sequence (i to iv) converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a futile loop and cannot be correct.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    *   Step ii: Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. (Correct, as per Strategy C).\n    *   Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (TARGET!). (Correct, as per Strategy C).\n    This sequence of the first three steps is precisely Strategy C, which we identified as a high-yield route. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are nonsensical, as they would take the desired product and transform it into something else. However, compared to the other options, this is the only one that contains a valid synthesis for the target molecule. It is common in such questions that the correct sequence is embedded within a longer, sometimes flawed, list.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence begins by creating aniline, then acetanilide, then introduces bromine and a nitro group. Ultimately, it uses deamination to produce 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. It fails to introduce the acetyl group onto the ring (N-acylation for protection is not the same as C-acylation via Friedel-Crafts on the ring). So, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination); ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration). This would produce a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrobromobenzene, with the para isomer (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) being the major product. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on this product would occur ortho to the bromine and meta to the nitro group, i.e., at position 2. This would yield 1-(2-acetyl-4-nitrophenyl)bromine, which is the wrong isomer. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is the only choice that contains a chemically correct and high-yield pathway to the target molecule, even if the sequence listed is unnecessarily long. The first three steps of Option B represent the most logical synthesis: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1.  Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   The parent chain is ethan-1-one, which means there is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   This acetyl group is attached to a phenyl ring. The resulting molecule is acetophenone.\n*   The phenyl ring is substituted with a bromo group (-Br) at position 3 and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5, relative to the acetyl group at position 1.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      COCH3\n     /   \\\n    C     C\n   //    \\\\\n  C-NO2   C-Br\n   \\     //\n    C---C\n```\nThe three substituents (-COCH3, -Br, -NO2) are all meta to each other (in 1,3,5 positions).\n\n### 2.  Analyze the Substituent Directing Effects\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent directs the next incoming electrophile in an Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) reaction:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Weakly deactivating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Formed by reducing a nitro group (e.g., with Fe/HCl). It is strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**. When protonated in strong acid to -NH3+, it becomes strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\nA key rule for Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3) is that they **do not work** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a -NO2 group or an -NH2 group (which complexes with the AlCl3 catalyst).\n\n### 3.  Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. It correctly introduces the acetyl group. The product is acetophenone (C6H5COCH3). The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (position 3). This step is correct.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone:** We are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the new substituent to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    The directing groups are in conflict. However, the acetyl group is a very strong deactivator, especially for its ortho and para positions (2, 4, 6). The least deactivated position for an incoming electrophile is C5, which is meta to both existing groups. Therefore, nitration predominantly occurs at C5 to yield **3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**, which is the target molecule `1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`.\n\nThis sequence of the first three steps provides a high-yield synthesis of the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) would modify the product and are superfluous to its synthesis, but the initial sequence is chemically sound and successful.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt**\n*   **iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene:** This sequence of four steps just returns to the starting material, benzene. It is a futile loop and thus an incorrect synthetic pathway.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form a complex. This complex deactivates the ring so strongly that the Friedel-Crafts reaction does not proceed. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene**\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Bromonitrobenzene (major product):** Bromine is an ortho,para-director.\n*   **iii) 4-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring containing a nitro group. As mentioned earlier, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. The nitro group prevents this reaction from occurring. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n### 4.  Conclusion\n\n*   Options B, C, and D contain chemically unfeasible steps.\n*   Option A contains a correct and high-yield three-step synthesis to the target molecule. Although it lists extra, unnecessary steps, it is the only option that presents a valid pathway to the product. The question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, which the first part of sequence A accomplishes.\n\nTherefore, sequence A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position C1.\n    2.  A bromine atom (-Br) at position C3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2) at position C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means all three groups are meta to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution is crucial:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n\nThe goal is to introduce these three groups in an order that leverages their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Routes\n\nLet's consider the possible orders of introducing the three functional groups.\n\n*   **Ideal Route (Hypothetical):** The most logical sequence that takes advantage of directing effects would be one where a meta-director is used to place subsequent groups.\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Start by adding the acetyl group to benzene.\n        *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Nitrate acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group will direct the incoming nitro group to position 3.\n        *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.\n    3.  **Bromination:** Brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. Now, the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3). Both are **meta-directors**. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming bromine to C5. The -NO2 group also directs the incoming bromine to C5. This is a case of **concerted or reinforcing direction**, which should lead to a high yield of the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n    This ideal 3-step sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is chemically sound and expected to be high-yield. However, this sequence is not presented as an option. We must evaluate the given options.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Provided Options\n\nLet's analyze each option based on established principles of organic synthesis. Many options include steps like `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO2 to -NH2) and `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization of -NH2), suggesting complex routes that might use an amino group as a temporary director.\n\n*   **Option A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   i) **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. (Good)\n    *   ii) **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. (The meta-directing acetyl group makes this a good step).\n    *   iii) **Nitration:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Here, the directing effects conflict. The -COCH3 group (at C1) directs meta (to C5), while the -Br group (at C3) directs ortho/para (to C2, C4, C6). This conflict will result in a mixture of several isomers, meaning the yield of the desired 1,3,5-product will be low. This violates the \"high-yield\" condition. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical in the given order.\n\n*   **Option B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   i) **Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   ii) **Nitration:** Bromobenzene → 4-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n    *   iii) **Acylation:** This step involves Friedel-Crafts acylation on 4-bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group and moderately deactivated by the bromo group. **Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene derivatives.** This step will fail.\n\n*   **Option C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; ... v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   The first four steps convert benzene to benzene, which is illogical. Assuming we look at the core substitution sequence presented later (v, vi, vii): Bromination → Acylation → Nitration.\n    *   Acylation of bromobenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. Nitrating the major para-isomer (4-bromoacetophenone) would lead to 4-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone because both the bromo and acetyl groups direct to that position. This is not the desired 1,3,5-isomer.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   i) **Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) **Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) **Acylation:** This step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. **This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3)**, poisoning the catalyst and strongly deactivating the ring.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\n*   Options B, C, and D contain steps that are textbook examples of reactions that fail or give the wrong products. The Friedel-Crafts reaction is particularly sensitive and fails on aniline or rings with strong deactivating groups like -NO2.\n*   Option A consists of a sequence of reactions that will all proceed. However, step (iii), the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone, suffers from poor regioselectivity due to conflicting directing groups, which means it will not be a high-yield synthesis of the desired isomer.\n\nGiven that options B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed because they include reactions that do not work, Option A remains the only plausible, albeit imperfect, choice. It is common in such questions that one option is \"less wrong\" than others. The failure to achieve high yield in one step (Option A) is often considered a less severe error than a reaction that fails completely (Options B, C, D). The additional steps listed in Option A after step (iii) appear to be distractors, as they form a chemically illogical sequence. The core of the question is the order of the first three electrophilic substitutions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent ring is benzene.\n    *   It has three substituents:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:** In electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n    *   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and *ortho, para*-directing (often an intermediate).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies:**\n    *   **Strategy 1: All meta-directors.** A common way to achieve 1,3,5-substitution is to add meta-directing groups sequentially.\n        *   Path A: Benzene → Acetophenone (-COCH3, m-director) → 3-Nitroacetophenone (-COCH3 directs NO2 meta) → 1-(3-Bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone. In the last step, both -COCH3 and -NO2 are meta-directors at positions 1 and 3. They both direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the position that is meta to both of them, which is position 5. This is a very sound synthetic strategy, though it may require forcing conditions for the last step due to the deactivated ring. However, this exact sequence is not among the options.\n    *   **Strategy 2: Conflicting directors.** What if we have a mix of director types? The outcome depends on their relative strengths and positions.\n    *   **Strategy 3: Use a directing group and then remove it.** The Sandmeyer reaction (diazotization of an amino group, followed by replacement) or deamination (replacement with -H) allows for creating substitution patterns that are not directly accessible.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:** Let's analyze each sequence step-by-step.\n\n    *   **Option A:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n        *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n        *   ii) Bromobenzene → A mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene. The -Br is an o,p-director. The para isomer is major.\n        *   iii) 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts Acylation. This reaction works very poorly, or not at all, on rings that are strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This pathway is not high-yield. **Incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n        *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. Works well.\n        *   ii) Acetophenone → 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone. The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at the meta position (C3). This is a standard, high-yield reaction.\n        *   iii) 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone → ??. Here we nitrate a ring with a meta-director (-COCH3) and an ortho,para-director (-Br) in a meta relationship. This is a case of conflicting directing effects. The -Br directs to positions 2, 4, 6. The -COCH3 directs to position 5. One might assume that the o,p-director would win, leading to a mixture of 4- and 6-nitro products. However, the ring is significantly deactivated by both groups. Electrophilic attack at the positions ortho to the acetyl group (positions 2 and 4) is highly disfavored. Attack at position 2 is also sterically hindered. Therefore, attack at position 5, which is meta to both deactivating groups, becomes the \"least unfavorable\" pathway, making 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone the major product. This is a known, albeit somewhat counter-intuitive, reaction that gives the desired product in good yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) would modify this correct product, so they must be irrelevant distractors. This sequence is plausible.\n\n    *   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n        *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n        *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is Friedel-Crafts acylation. It fails on aniline because the amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex. **Incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...`\n        *   i-iv) Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene. This sequence of four steps just returns to the starting material, benzene. It is nonsensical. If we follow the subsequent steps starting from the regenerated benzene:\n        *   v) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n        *   vi) Bromobenzene → 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethanone (para product is major because -Br is an o,p-director).\n        *   vii) 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethanone → 1-(4-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethanone. Here, the -Br (o,p-director) and -COCH3 (m-director) are para to each other. They both direct nitration to position 3. The resulting product is the 1,3,4-isomer, not the desired 1,3,5-isomer. **Incorrect.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the detailed analysis, the first three steps of Option B provide the only viable, high-yield synthetic route to the target molecule among the choices. The apparent conflict in directing groups in step (iii) is resolved in favor of the desired product due to the electronic and steric environment of the deactivated ring.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and the provided reaction options.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   Let's number the ring starting from the acetyl group at C1. The bromo group is at C3, and the nitro group is at C5.\n*   This is a **1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene derivative**. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\nTo plan a synthesis, we must consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group)**: Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group)**: Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino group)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. This group is relevant as it is formed by reducing a nitro group (Fe/HCl).\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium ion)**: Formed from -NH2 in strong acid. Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nA critical rule in EAS is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (acylation and alkylation) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**. This means we cannot perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that already has a -NO2 group or other strongly deactivating groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating a \"Simple\" Direct Synthesis\nLet's first consider the most direct way to assemble the molecule. The Friedel-Crafts acylation must be done before the ring is strongly deactivated (i.e., before nitration).\n1.  **Acylation**: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n2.  Now we need to add -Br and -NO2 to acetophenone at the meta positions (C3 and C5). Let's consider the two possible orders.\n    *   **Order A: Nitrate then Brominate**\n        a. **Nitration**: Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-directing) → 3-Nitroacetophenone. This works well.\n        b. **Bromination**: 3-Nitroacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (at C1, m-director) and -NO2 (at C3, m-director). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position. The directing effects are **reinforcing**. This is an excellent synthetic step.\n        *This sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is a highly efficient and logical route to the target molecule.*\n\n    *   **Order B: Brominate then Nitrate**\n        a. **Bromination**: Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-directing) → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This works.\n        b. **Nitration**: 3-Bromoacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (at C1, m-director) and -Br (at C3, o,p-director). The directors are in **conflict**. -COCH3 directs to C5, while -Br directs to C2, C4, and C6. This would likely lead to a mixture of products and is not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nThe best simple route is Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. However, none of the options list this sequence. This suggests we must evaluate the given, more complex options, which likely involve using a temporary directing group that is later removed. The presence of the `Fe/HCl` (reduction), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination) sequence points to this strategy. This sequence effectively replaces a -NO2 group with a -H atom, via an -NH2 intermediate.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Given Options\n\n*   **Option A**: i) Acylation; ii) Bromination; iii) Nitration... This follows Order B discussed above. It's plausible but potentially low-yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically flawed if they are to follow step (iii). For instance, step (v) involves nitrating a product that contains an unprotected amino group under strongly acidic conditions, which would either oxidize the amine or protonate it into a meta-director, leading to the wrong product.\n\n*   **Option C & D**: Option C fails because step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, a strongly deactivated ring. This reaction does not work. Option D involves a circular sequence of steps (i-iv) that converts benzene back to benzene, making it nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option B**: Let's trace this pathway carefully. It employs the temporary directing group strategy.\n    i)   **Benzene → Nitrobenzene** (HNO3/H2SO4). Standard.\n    ii)  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline** (Fe/HCl). Standard reduction. The ring now has a powerful o,p-directing -NH2 group.\n    iii) **Aniline → p-Aminoacetophenone** (CH3COCl/AlCl3). This step is written as a Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline, which is problematic because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group. However, this sequence of reagents can be interpreted as a shorthand for an N-acylation followed by a **Fries Rearrangement**, which moves the acetyl group from the nitrogen to the ring, predominantly at the para position. Let's assume this gives p-aminoacetophenone.\n    iv) **p-Aminoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone** (Br2/FeBr3). We brominate p-aminoacetophenone. The strong o,p-directing -NH2 group at C4 will direct the bromine to its ortho position, C3. This is a plausible step.\n    v)  **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone** (HNO3/H2SO4). We nitrate the product from step (iv). Again, the powerful activating -NH2 group at C4 will direct the incoming -NO2 group to its other vacant ortho position, C5. (Note: In practice, the amino group would be protected as an amide to prevent oxidation and protonation, but in the context of a multiple-choice question, we assume the desired regiochemistry is achieved).\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazonium salt** (NaNO2/HCl). The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium group (-N2+).\n    vii) **Diazonium salt → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (H3PO2). The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThe final product has the -COCH3 group at C1, -Br at C3, and -NO2 at C5. This matches the target molecule exactly. Although this path relies on a charitable interpretation of steps (iii) and (v), it is the only sequence provided that logically leads to the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The other options contain chemically impossible steps or lead to incorrect products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   Let's assign the position of the acetyl group (-COCH3) as C1.\n*   The bromo group (-Br) is at C3.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is at C5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other on the ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the Substituent Properties (Directing Effects)**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of each substituent is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director. It is installed via Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director. It is installed via bromination (e.g., Br2/FeBr3).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director. It is installed via nitration (e.g., HNO3/H2SO4).\n\n**3. Key Constraints in Synthesis**\n\nThere are important rules and limitations in electrophilic aromatic substitution that must be considered:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation do not work on strongly deactivated benzene rings (e.g., those bearing a -NO2 group). They also fail on rings with an amino group (-NH2) because the amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl3).\n*   **Order Matters:** The order in which substituents are introduced determines the final substitution pattern, as each new substituent is directed by the groups already present on the ring.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each proposed reaction sequence based on these principles.\n\n**Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> p-Bromonitrobenzene** (major product) + o-Bromonitrobenzene.\n3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group and also deactivated by the -Br group. The Friedel-Crafts reaction will not proceed or will give a very low yield. **Therefore, Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline.** The -NH2 group is strongly activating and an *o,p*-director.\n3.  **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the catalyst and the ring, preventing the acylation reaction. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   The first four steps are: Nitration -> Reduction to Amine -> Diazotization -> Deamination. This sequence (i-iv) takes benzene and converts it back to benzene, making these steps redundant and illogical.\n*   Let's look at the sequence starting from benzene for the relevant substitutions: v) Br2/FeBr3 followed by vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3.\n1.  **Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene.** The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> p-Bromoacetophenone** (major product) + o-Bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **p-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ???** Now we nitrate p-bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 at C1, -Br at C4). The -COCH3 group directs *meta* (to C3, C5). The -Br group directs *ortho* (to C3, C5). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions. So, the product will be 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. This is not the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n1.  **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.** This is the Friedel-Crafts acylation. An acetyl group (-COCH3) is added, which is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine will add to the meta position (C3). The structure is now correct for the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** We are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects are:\n    *   -COCH3 (at C1) is a *meta*-director, directing to C5.\n    *   -Br (at C3) is an *ortho, para*-director, directing to C2, C4, C6.\n    In cases of conflicting directors where one is a strong *meta*-director (like -COCH3) and the other is a weaker *o,p*-director (like -Br), the position that is least deactivated will be attacked. The -COCH3 group strongly deactivates its *ortho* and *para* positions (C2, C4, C6), making C5 the most favorable site for electrophilic attack. This reaction is known to produce the desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone in high yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence C successfully produce the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv-vii) appear to be erroneous additions to the question, as they would modify the correct product into something else. However, among the given choices, Option C is the only one that contains a valid and high-yield pathway to the desired product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions involves first introducing the *meta*-directing acetyl group, followed by sequential substitutions that are directed by the groups already on the ring to form the 1,3,5 pattern. Option C provides a valid synthetic route in its first three steps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere's a thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An **acetyl group (-COCH3)** at position 1. This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced by Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3).\n    *   A **bromo group (-Br)** at position 3. This is a deactivating group and an **ortho-, para-director**. It is introduced by electrophilic bromination (Br2/FeBr3).\n    *   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 5. This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced by nitration (HNO3/H2SO4).\n*   The substitution pattern is **1,3,5**. All three groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nThe goal is to add these three groups to a benzene ring in the correct positions to achieve high yield. The order of reactions is crucial due to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n*   **Constraint on Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO2 group. Therefore, the acetyl group (-COCH3) must be added to the ring before the nitro group, or at least when the ring is not yet strongly deactivated.\n\nLet's consider a direct approach by sequentially adding the groups.\n\n**Direct Synthesis Pathway (Hypothesis)**\n\nA highly logical and efficient pathway would be:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acylation.** Start with benzene and add the acetyl group. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Step 2: Nitration.** Nitrate acetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the meta position.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. This is a high-yield reaction.\n3.  **Step 3: Bromination.** Brominate 3-nitroacetophenone. The ring now has two directors: -COCH3 (meta) and -NO2 (meta). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5. Their directing effects reinforce each other.\n    *   3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   Although the ring is heavily deactivated, making the reaction slow, it is very clean (regioselective) and should give a high yield of the desired product.\n\nThis three-step synthesis (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is the most chemically sound and high-yield route. Now, we must check if any of the given options match this sequence or another valid sequence.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nAll options present a seven-step sequence involving a recurring set of reagents: CH3COCl/AlCl3, Br2/FeBr3, HNO3/H2SO4 (x2), Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2. The sequence `Fe/HCl` (reduces NO2 to NH2) followed by `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) and `H3PO2` (deamination) is used to remove an amino group, which suggests a complex synthesis using a temporary directing group. However, let's analyze the options as written.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    This sequence starts by nitrating benzene to nitrobenzene, reducing it to aniline, then diazotizing and deaminating it back to benzene. This is a pointless circle and therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `...ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...`\n    This option attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation (iii) on aniline (product of step ii). This reaction does not work. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair on the amine (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-), which strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. Thus, this option is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `...ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...`\n    This sequence produces 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product from i and ii) and then attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation on it. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and especially the nitro group. The FC acylation will not proceed in any significant yield. Thus, this option is chemically incorrect for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard and effective first step.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so this step works well to produce the meta-brominated product.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ?** Here, we are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. We have two directing groups: -COCH3 (meta-director, at position 1) and -Br (ortho-, para-director, at position 3). The -COCH3 directs to position 5. The -Br directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. The directing effects are in conflict. This will result in a mixture of isomers, with the main products being 3-bromo-4-nitro- and 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone. The desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone will be formed, but as a minor product. Therefore, this step does not lead to a *high-yield* synthesis of the target compound.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Choice**\n\n*   Options A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps for a high-yield synthesis.\n*   The first three steps of Option C (`Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration`) can produce the desired molecule, although not in high yield due to the non-selective nitration in the third step.\n*   The optimal sequence (`Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination`) is not provided as an option.\n*   The steps following step (iii) in option C (`iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`) are nonsensical. They would involve reducing the product's nitro group, then attempting another nitration, and finally removing the newly formed amine, ultimately leading back to an earlier intermediate.\n\nGiven the choices, there appears to be a flaw in the question or the options. However, in a multiple-choice context, one must choose the \"best\" or \"least incorrect\" answer. Options B and D are fundamentally flawed with impossible reactions. Option A is circular. Option C, while not providing a \"high-yield\" route because of a single conflicting step, at least follows a sequence of individually plausible reactions that *can* lead to the formation of the target product. It's the most plausible synthetic logic among the choices, despite its significant drawbacks.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Ideal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern strongly suggests a specific strategy. To achieve this pattern with high yield, we should perform substitutions under the influence of *meta*-directing groups. The presence of an *ortho, para*-director (-Br) complicates things, so its introduction needs careful timing.\n\nA highly logical and efficient pathway would be:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation** of benzene to form acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Nitration** of acetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to the *meta* position.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3.  **Bromination** of 3-nitroacetophenone. Now, the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3). Both are strong *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromo group to position C5. This reaction should be highly regioselective, giving the desired product.\n    *   3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target Molecule)\n\nThis ideal sequence of key reactions is: **Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's examine the options provided to see which one matches or most closely resembles this ideal strategy. We'll focus on the order of introduction of the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups. We will also consider the additional steps.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   This sequence is Bromination → Nitration → Acylation.\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and especially the nitro group, making this reaction extremely difficult and low-yield. This option is not viable for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   This sequence is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n    *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone. This is a good first step.\n    *   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The meta-directing -COCH3 group correctly places the bromine at C3.\n    *   iii) Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Here we have two directors: -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho, para).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs to C5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   The o,p-directing effect of the halogen typically overrides the meta-director. The positions activated by the halogen (C2, C4, C6) are kinetically favored over the highly deactivated C5 position (which is meta to both groups). This step would produce a mixture of isomers, with the desired 1,3,5 product being a very minor product. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" route under standard kinetic control.\n    *   However, compared to other options, this sequence starts plausibly. Friedel-Crafts on nitro-compounds (Options A, C) is generally considered to fail. While step (iii) in B has regioselectivity issues, the reaction itself is feasible. The question's reference to \"high yield\" might imply thermodynamic control where the more stable 1,3,5-isomer could be favored, or it might be that this is the \"best\" flawed option.\n    *   The subsequent steps (iv-vii) involving reduction and diazotization seem superfluous if the target is made at step (iii), suggesting they may be distractors or part of an convoluted and incorrect pathway.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) ... ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ...\n    *   This sequence attempts Acylation after Nitration and other steps. After steps (i) Nitration and (ii) Bromination, the intermediate would be 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation of 3-bromonitrobenzene fails for the same reason as in Option A: the ring is strongly deactivated.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with nitration, reduction to aniline, then deamination back to benzene, which is nonsensical.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Options A and C fail because they schedule a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a heavily deactivated, nitro-substituted ring.\n*   Option D is a logically flawed sequence.\n*   Option B follows a sequence of reactions where each step is chemically possible, although the nitration step (iii) suffers from poor regioselectivity for the desired product under normal conditions.\n\nDespite the low yield of the specific isomer in step (iii), Option B represents the most plausible sequence among the given choices, as the other options contain steps that are generally considered to be non-viable. The ideal pathway (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is a small permutation of Option B (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration). It's possible the question considers this route viable, perhaps assuming conditions that favor the thermodynamic 1,3,5 product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis question asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene with a high yield.\n\nLet's first analyze the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents:\n1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3)\n2.  A bromo group (-Br)\n3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. All three groups are `meta` to each other.\n-   -COCH3 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n-   -Br is a deactivating, ortho,para-directing group.\n-   -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring often involves using a powerful directing group that is later removed or modified. A common strategy is to use an amino group (-NH2), which is a strong ortho,para-director, and then remove it at the end of the synthesis via a Sandmeyer-type reaction (diazotization followed by reduction). The presence of steps involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO2 to -NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination, i.e., replacement of the diazonium group with -H) in options A, B, and C suggests such a strategy.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) **Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene:** This is the standard nitration of benzene. The nitro group is a meta-director.\nii) **Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to a primary amine. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong ortho,para-director.\niii) **Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?** This step represents Friedel-Crafts acylation. Direct acylation of aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivating anilinium complex. However, it is possible to achieve this transformation. A common way is N-acylation to form acetanilide, followed by a Fries rearrangement to yield ortho- and para-aminoacetophenone. The para-isomer is usually the major product. Let's assume this step yields **p-aminoacetophenone** [1-(4-aminophenyl)ethan-1-one].\niv) **p-Aminoacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> ?** Bromination. We now have two directing groups: -NH2 (at position 4, strong o,p-director) and -COCH3 (at position 1, m-director).\n    -   The -NH2 group directs bromination to its ortho positions (3 and 5).\n    -   The -COCH3 group directs bromination to its meta positions (3 and 5).\n    -   The groups are cooperative, so bromination will occur with high yield at position 3 (or 5, which is equivalent). The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**.\nv) **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Nitration. We now have three directing groups: -COCH3 (at 1, meta), -Br (at 3, o,p), and -NH2 (at 4, strong o,p).\n    -   -NH2 at C-4 directs to C-5 (position 3 is blocked).\n    -   -COCH3 at C-1 directs to C-5 (position 3 is blocked).\n    -   -Br at C-3 directs to C-2 and C-6.\n    -   The powerful activating -NH2 group and the meta-directing -COCH3 group both strongly direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. Their influence overrides the weaker directing effect of bromine. The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone**.\nvi) **Diazotization --(NaNO2/HCl)-->** The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\nvii) **Deamination --(H3PO2)-->** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. This removes the amino group that was used to direct the substitutions.\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This synthetic pathway is logical and all steps contribute to the formation of the desired product in high yield.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) **Benzene -> Acetophenone:** (-COCH3 is a m-director).\nii) **Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** (-COCH3 directs Br to the meta position).\niii) **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?** Nitration. The ring has a -COCH3 group (meta-director) and a -Br group (o,p-director). The -Br group is a stronger director in terms of position, so nitration would primarily occur at positions 4 and 6 (ortho/para to bromine), not position 5 (meta to both). This step would not give the desired precursor in high yield. The rest of the sequence is nonsensical as it involves reducing the nitro group only to nitrate the ring again. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) **Benzene -> Bromobenzene:** (-Br is an o,p-director).\nii) **Bromobenzene -> p-Bromonitrobenzene:** Nitration gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with para being the major one.\niii) **p-Bromonitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?** Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, so this reaction is extremely slow and low-yielding. Furthermore, both -Br and -NO2 direct the incoming acetyl group to position 2 (ortho to Br, meta to NO2). This would form 1-(2-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone, where the acetyl and bromo groups are ortho, not meta as required in the final product. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni-iv) **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline -> Diazonium salt -> Benzene:** These steps just nitrate benzene and then remove the nitro group, returning to the starting material. This is incorrect.\n\nConclusion: Option A outlines a viable and strategic synthesis route that uses an amino group as a temporary directing group to achieve the specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern required.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are `meta` to each other.\n\n2.  **Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    In electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new groups to specific positions.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a `meta`-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a `meta`-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an `ortho, para`-director.\n\n3.  **Devise a Plausible Synthesis Strategy:**\n    To obtain the 1,3,5-pattern, the substitutions should ideally be directed by `meta`-directing groups. The presence of the `ortho, para`-directing bromo group means the order of reactions is critical.\n\n    Let's consider putting the groups on in different orders.\n    *   **Strategy 1: Brominate first.** (Benzene → Bromobenzene). The -Br group is an o,p-director. Adding the next group (e.g., acetyl) would result in ortho and para products, not the required meta product. This is not an efficient starting point.\n    *   **Strategy 2: Nitrate first.** (Benzene → Nitrobenzene). The -NO2 group is a `meta`-director. The next substitution (e.g., bromination) would occur at the meta position, giving 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This establishes the correct relationship between Br and NO2. The next step would be to add the acetyl group. However, Friedel-Crafts acylation (the standard way to add an acetyl group) fails on rings that are strongly deactivated, especially by a nitro group. So, nitration should not precede acylation.\n    *   **Strategy 3: Acylate first.** (Benzene → Acetophenone). The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a `meta`-director.\n        *   The next step could be bromination. Brominating acetophenone places the -Br at the `meta` position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. The -COCH3 and -Br groups are now meta (1,3), which matches the target's relative positioning.\n        *   The final step would be nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. Let's analyze the directing effects: we have an acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1 (meta-director) and a bromo group (-Br) at C3 (ortho,para-director).\n            *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n            *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n            *   This is a case of competing directors. However, substitution at position 5 is strongly favored because it is the position directed by the powerful meta-directing acetyl group. While Br directs elsewhere, the ring positions it favors (especially 2 and 4) are highly deactivated due to their proximity to the acetyl group. Therefore, the major product of this reaction is indeed 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   This sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is a chemically sound and efficient route to the target molecule.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    Now we match our proposed strategy with the choices provided.\n\n    *   **A) i) Br2/FeBr3...** Starts with bromination. Incorrect strategy for a 1,3,5 product. Also involves Friedel-Crafts on a nitrated ring (step iii after step ii), which fails.\n    *   **B) i) HNO3/H2SO4...vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3...** This option correctly performs acylation (vi) before nitration (vii). Let's trace the main pathway (ignoring the illogical steps i-iv that convert benzene back to benzene):\n        *   v) Bromination → Bromobenzene\n        *   vi) Acylation → 4-bromoacetophenone (para isomer is major)\n        *   vii) Nitration → The -COCH3 (at C1) and -Br (at C4) both direct to position 3. This yields 1-(4-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is the wrong isomer.\n    *   **C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3...** This sequence involves a Friedel-Crafts acylation (iii) on aniline (product of step ii). This reaction fails because the amine's lone pair (a Lewis base) attacks the AlCl3 catalyst (a Lewis acid), deactivating it and the ring. The sequence is flawed.\n    *   **D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...** This option begins with the exact sequence we identified as the most plausible route:\n        *   i) **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone\n        *   ii) **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone\n        *   iii) **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (the target molecule)\n    *   The remaining steps (iv-vii) in option D are chemically nonsensical. For instance, step (iv) Fe/HCl would reduce the nitro group that was just added in step (iii). It seems the question lists a correct synthetic pathway followed by superfluous steps. Among the given choices, this is the only one that contains a correct and high-yield method to form the desired product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe sequence of reactions in option D, specifically the first three steps, provides a direct and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The other options either follow incorrect synthetic strategies, lead to the wrong isomer, or contain chemically non-viable steps early in the sequence. Therefore, Option D represents the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThis problem asks for the sequence of reactions that leads to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It's a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\nLet's consider the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. This group is often used as a powerful director and then removed.\n*   **-NHCOCH3 (acetamido):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's a protected form of the amino group.\n\n**2. Evaluate a Direct Synthesis Approach**\n\nA simple, direct approach would be to add the three groups sequentially to the benzene ring.\n*   **Path A:** Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination.\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 3-Nitroacetophenone. The nitration occurs at the meta position, which is position 3.\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> Both -COCH3 and -NO2 are *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This would give the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    This pathway is chemically sound and would lead to the correct product. However, it's a 3-step synthesis, and all the options provided are 7 steps long. This suggests a more complex strategy is intended, likely because the final bromination step on a ring deactivated by two groups (-COCH3 and -NO2) might have a low yield. The long sequences in the options, which include steps for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and deamination (H3PO2), strongly point towards a strategy where an amino group is used as a temporary directing group and then removed.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthesis Strategy Involving Deamination**\n\nThe deamination strategy involves using a powerful ortho,para-directing amino group to install substituents in specific locations and then removing it at the end of the synthesis. The final product has unsubstituted positions at 2, 4, and 6. This means the precursor molecule had an amino group at one of these positions, which was subsequently removed.\n\nLet's work backward. To get the final product by removing an amino group, the precursor must have been an aminobromonitroacetophenone. For example, if we remove an amino group from position 4, the precursor would be 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The removal of the -NH2 from C4 would leave substituents at C1(-COCH3), C3(-Br), and C5(-NO2), which is exactly the target molecule.\n\nLet's devise a synthesis for this precursor: 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nA logical starting point for this is p-aminoacetophenone or its protected form, p-acetamidoacetophenone. Let's see how we can use its directing groups. The key intermediate is p-acetamidoacetophenone.\nOn this molecule (C1: -COCH3, C4: -NHCOCH3):\n*   The acetamido group (-NHCOCH3) is a strong activating *o,p*-director. It will direct incoming groups to its ortho positions (C3 and C5).\n*   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a deactivating *m*-director. It directs to C3 and C5.\n\nBoth groups direct substituents to the same positions (3 and 5). This convergence of directing effects leads to high yields.\nLet's perform bromination and nitration:\n*   **Bromination first, then nitration:**\n    1.  *p-Acetamidoacetophenone* + Br2 -> The bromine will add to position 3 (ortho to -NHAc). Product: *4-acetamido-3-bromoacetophenone*.\n    2.  Nitrate this product: We have -NHAc (at C4), -Br (at C3), and -COCH3 (at C1).\n        *   -NHAc (strong o,p-director) directs to C5.\n        *   -Br (o,p-director) directs to C5 (para position).\n        *   -COCH3 (m-director) directs to C5.\n        All three groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This is a highly selective reaction. Product: *4-acetamido-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone*.\n*   The sequence to get the final product from here is:\n    3.  **Hydrolysis** of the acetamido group (-NHCOCH3) to an amino group (-NH2) using acid (e.g., H3O+). Product: *4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone*.\n    4.  **Diazotization** of the amino group with NaNO2/HCl.\n    5.  **Deamination** (removal of the diazonium group) with H3PO2 to give the final product.\n\n**4. Match the Synthesis Path to the Options**\n\nNow, let's find the option that matches this logical, high-yield pathway. The key substitution order on the intermediate is Bromination then Nitration.\n\nThe required steps are:\nBenzene -> Aniline -> Acetanilide/p-aminoacetophenone intermediate -> Add acetyl group -> Bromination -> Nitration -> Hydrolysis -> Diazotization -> Deamination.\n\nLet's analyze Option B:\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n\n*   **i) & ii):** Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. This creates the key starting amine.\n*   **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This step is meant to acylate aniline. While the reagents are typically for Friedel-Crafts acylation of a ring, in the context of these options, it's the step that introduces an acetyl group. Let's assume this sequence (perhaps N-acetylation followed by Fries Rearrangement, or FC acylation of acetanilide) produces the key intermediate *p-aminoacetophenone* (or *p-acetamidoacetophenone*).\n*   **iv) Br2/FeBr3:** This is bromination.\n*   **v) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is nitration.\n*   **vi) & vii):** This is the diazotization and deamination sequence.\n\nThis option follows the correct order of functional group introductions (apart from some ambiguities/missing steps like protection/deprotection): creation of an aniline derivative, followed by bromination, then nitration, and finally removal of the guiding amino group. The intermediate steps are guided by the powerful activating effects of the amino/acetamido group, leading to the desired regiochemistry in high yield. The implicit protection/deprotection steps are likely assumed or bundled into the reagent steps in this multiple-choice question format.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options fail:\n*   **A:** Creates benzene after 4 steps, making no sense.\n*   **C:** Nitrates 3-bromoacetophenone. The directors conflict, leading to a mixture of isomers and low yield of the required intermediate.\n*   **D:** Attempts Friedel-Crafts on a highly deactivated ring (p-bromonitrobenzene), which is difficult, and subsequent steps lead to the wrong isomer.\n\nTherefore, option B represents the most chemically sound and high-yield synthesis pathway, despite its condensed and somewhat imprecise notation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3). Let's place this at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nTo plan the synthesis, we must consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles during Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** A deactivating group and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\nA key reaction in these sequences is the **Friedel-Crafts acylation** (to add the -COCH3 group). A critical rule for this reaction is that it **fails on strongly deactivated rings**, particularly those substituted with a nitro group (-NO2). This implies that the acetyl group must be introduced *before* the nitro group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's examine each option based on these principles.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   The sequence begins with nitration (i), making nitrobenzene.\n    *   It then attempts acylation (vi) *after* bromination (v), on bromobenzene. This would produce mainly *para*-bromoacetophenone (4-bromoacetophenone), not the *meta* isomer needed.\n    *   The overall sequence is illogical and leads to the wrong isomer. Steps (i) to (iv) are a roundabout way of converting benzene to benzene, which makes no sense.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   The sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene (i), then reduction to aniline (ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and inhibiting the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   This sequence starts by making bromobenzene (i), then p-bromonitrobenzene (ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on p-bromonitrobenzene. The presence of the strongly deactivating nitro group prevents this reaction from occurring.\n    *   Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   Let's analyze the steps sequentially:\n        1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 on benzene:** This is Friedel-Crafts acylation, which forms **acetophenone**. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director. This is a good starting point.\n        2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3 on acetophenone:** This is bromination. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3, forming **3-bromoacetophenone**. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n        3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4 on 3-bromoacetophenone:** This is nitration. We need to add the -NO2 group at position 5. Let's look at the directing effects in 3-bromoacetophenone:\n            *   The -COCH3 group (at 1) is a meta-director, directing the -NO2 group to position 5.\n            *   The -Br group (at 3) is an ortho, para-director, directing the -NO2 group to positions 2, 4, and 6 on the ring.\n            *   Although the directors are in conflict, it is known experimentally that nitration occurs preferentially at position 5, which is meta to both existing deactivating groups, likely because this position is sterically accessible and electronically least disfavored. This reaction gives the desired product, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, in high yield.\n    *   The first three steps of this sequence constitute a logical and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) seem illogical and extraneous (e.g., reducing a nitro group that was just added, followed by another nitration). They are likely included in error in the problem statement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating options A, B, and D based on fundamental chemical principles, we are left with C. The first three steps of sequence C provide a chemically sound and efficient route to the target product. Therefore, C is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is an **acetophenone** derivative, meaning it has a benzene ring with an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The numbering indicates that if the acetyl group is at position 1, the bromine is at position 3, and the nitro group is at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are **meta** to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl)**: Deactivating and **meta**-directing.\n*   **-Br (bromo)**: Deactivating (weakly) and **ortho, para**-directing.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Deactivating (strongly) and **meta**-directing.\n\nThe final 1,3,5-pattern is difficult to achieve directly because the bromo group is an ortho, para-director, which conflicts with the meta-positions of the other two groups. This suggests a more complex synthesis, possibly involving a \"place-holder\" group that is later removed or modified. The presence of the deamination sequence `(Fe/HCl; NaNO2/HCl; H3PO2)` in the options is a strong hint that an amino group (derived from a nitro group) is used as a temporary directing group and then removed.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence of reactions:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction **fails** on strongly activated rings like aniline because the nitrogen atom of the amino group coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex (-NH2+-AlCl3), which prevents the reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination)\nSteps (i) through (iv) simply convert benzene to benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be a synthetic route. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product)\n*   iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings substituted with strong deactivating groups like -NO2. This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis is the only remaining option. Let's trace the reactions carefully:\n*   i) Benzene → **Acetophenone**: Introduces the acetyl group (-COCH3). This is a meta-director.\n*   ii) Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**: The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position.\n*   iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → Nitration. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3) and an ortho, para-director (-Br). Their effects conflict. This step produces a mixture of isomers. However, a significant amount of the **3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone** isomer is formed, which can be isolated.\n*   iv) 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one**: The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   v) 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one → Nitration. The new amino group is a very powerful activating, ortho, para-director. It will control the position of the next substitution. Its para position is blocked by the acetyl group, and one ortho position (C3) is blocked by the bromine. Therefore, nitration occurs exclusively at the other ortho position, C5. The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   vi) The product from step (v) is treated with NaNO2/HCl. This converts the amino group at C4 into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   vii) The diazonium salt is treated with H3PO2. This is a deamination reaction that removes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This sequence, while complex, is chemically sound and leads to the desired target molecule in a controlled way, using a temporary amino group to direct a key substitution before being removed.\n\nTherefore, sequence B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's draw its structure. The parent is ethanone (an acetyl group, -COCH3) attached to a phenyl ring. The substituents on the phenyl ring are:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a meta-relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent affects further electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider putting the groups on one by one.\n\n*   **Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the *meta* position. Now we have substituents at positions 1 and 3.\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → In 3-nitroacetophenone, both the acetyl group (at C1) and the nitro group (at C3) are *meta*-directors. They will both direct an incoming electrophile (Br+) to position C5. This route is chemically sound from a directing-effects standpoint and would produce the desired 1-acetyl-3-bromo-5-nitrobenzene. However, the ring is heavily deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, which can make the final bromination step low-yielding. This specific sequence is not one of the options.\n\n*   **Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This works.\n    3.  3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Now we have a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The bromine is the stronger director (less deactivating). It directs the incoming nitro group to its *ortho* (C2, C4) and *para* (C6) positions. The *meta*-director (-COCH3) directs to C5. The major products would be 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone and 1-(3-bromo-6-nitrophenyl)ethanone, not the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone. Thus, this route will not give a high yield of the target molecule.\n\nSince simple routes have flaws or are not listed, we must consider more complex syntheses involving the modification or removal of directing groups. The presence of reagents for reduction of nitro groups (Fe/HCl) and deamination (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests such a strategy.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n    *   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) fail on strongly deactivated rings. The presence of a nitro group prevents this reaction. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n    *   This sequence of the first four steps simply converts benzene back to benzene, which makes no synthetic sense. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a deactivating -NH3+ group, which would direct *meta*. So, we might get 3-aminoacetophenone. Let's follow this.\n    *   iv) Bromination of 3-aminoacetophenone. The -NH2 group is a very strong *ortho, para*-director and will control the substitution, leading to bromination at positions 2, 4, or 6, not the required position 5.\n    *   Alternatively, step iii) might represent N-acylation (protection) to form acetanilide. The sequence would then proceed with further substitutions that, as explored in other cases, do not lead to the 1,3,5 pattern. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    Let's trace this synthetic pathway carefully.\n    1.  **i) Acylation:** Benzene → **Acetophenone**.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. (-COCH3 is a meta-director). Correct.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → **1-(3-Bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. As discussed, nitration is directed by the Br to positions 4 and 6. We can assume the 4-nitro isomer is formed as a major product and can be separated for the next step.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine. 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one → **1-(4-Amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    5.  **v) Nitration:** We nitrate 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one. Under the acidic conditions (HNO3/H2SO4), the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. To ensure correct directing, it's more likely that the amino group is first protected as an amide (-NHCOCH3), which is a strong *ortho, para*-director, and this protection step is implied. Let's analyze the directing effects with a protected amino group (acetamido group, -NHCOCH3) at position 4.\n        *   The powerful activating acetamido group at C4 directs *ortho* to it, which is C3 (occupied by Br) and C5.\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1 is a *meta*-director, directing to C5.\n        *   Both key groups direct the incoming nitro group to C5. Product: **1-(4-acetamido-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. (After reaction, the protecting group needs to be removed by hydrolysis, an implied step). This gives **1-(4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    7.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom using H3PO2.\n\nThe removal of the temporary directing group at position 4 leaves the final substituents at the desired positions: Acetyl (C1), Bromo (C3), and Nitro (C5). This complex but logical pathway successfully produces the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A outlines a valid, albeit sophisticated, synthetic route that utilizes a temporary directing group (which starts as a nitro group, is converted to an amine, and then removed) to achieve the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern. The other options contain chemically flawed steps.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. This means all substituents are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a moderately deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation (e.g., CH₃COCl/AlCl₃).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced via nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄).\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a weakly deactivating group and an **ortho, para-director**. It is introduced via bromination (e.g., Br₂/FeBr₃).\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the general strategy is to introduce meta-directing groups first to guide the subsequent additions. The presence of the ortho, para-directing bromo group makes the sequence tricky.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step.\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an o,p-director.\n*   Step ii: Bromobenzene → p-Nitrobromobenzene (major product) and o-Nitrobromobenzene.\n*   Step iii: This step attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on nitrobromobenzene. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings substituted with strongly deactivating groups like the nitro group (-NO₂). Therefore, this step will fail or give a negligible yield. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction).\n*   Step iii: Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt (diazotization).\n*   Step iv: Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene (deamination).\nThis sequence of four steps simply transforms benzene into nitrobenzene and then back to benzene. This is a futile loop and cannot be part of an efficient synthesis. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   Step iii: This attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂) to form a complex (-NH₃⁺), which is a strong deactivator and meta-director. While acylation at the meta position might occur, the reaction is generally problematic. Furthermore, subsequent steps would lead to the wrong isomers or messy products. A more fundamental issue can be identified by re-ordering the first steps of this option. A common proposed path for such molecules involves nitration then bromination, then trying to add the acetyl group: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> m-Bromonitrobenzene. Trying to perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on m-Bromonitrobenzene would fail for the same reason as in Option A (presence of the -NO₂ group). Any permutation starting with nitration will have difficulty with a subsequent Friedel-Crafts step. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → **Acetophenone**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a meta-director.\n*   Step ii: Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine will be directed to the meta (3) position. This is a good regioselective step.\n*   Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents:\n    *   -COCH₃ (at pos 1) is a **meta-director**, directing the new -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   -Br (at pos 3) is an **ortho, para-director**, directing the new -NO₂ group to positions 2, 4, and 6 (relative to the bromine atom, which corresponds to positions 2, 4, 6 on the ring).\n    The directing effects of the two groups are in conflict. However, both groups are deactivating. When placing a third substituent, the position that is meta to both existing meta-substituents (like here) is generally least disfavored electronically (even though one director is o,p). Position 5 is meta to the acetyl group and meta to the bromo group. Although this reaction would likely produce a mixture of isomers (meaning it is not strictly \"high-yield\" for just one product), it is the most plausible route among the given choices to form the desired product. In many contexts, this sequence is considered viable.\n*   Steps iv to vii appear superfluous and nonsensical if the desired product is formed in step iii. It's likely an error in the question's construction. However, the initial sequence `i-iii` is the most chemically sound path to the product among all options. It correctly installs the groups in an order that can lead to the desired connectivity, unlike the other options which contain impassable chemical hurdles or create the wrong isomers.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, sequence C provides the most plausible (though imperfect) route. It avoids fatal flaws like attempting Friedel-Crafts on a nitro-deactivated ring and leads to the correct arrangement of substituents, even if the regioselectivity of the final nitration step is not perfect. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone, which is a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    *   -COCH3 (acetyl group) at position 1.\n    *   -Br (bromo group) at position 3.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro group) at position 5.\n*   This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent affects further electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho-, para*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho-, para*-director. (This group appears in intermediate steps).\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director. (Forms when -NH2 is in strong acid).\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthesis Strategies**\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Direct Substitution**\n    If we sequentially add the three groups, the directors on the ring must guide the incoming groups to the correct positions. Since all groups are meta to each other, a good strategy would be to have meta-directing groups on the ring.\n    1.  **Benzene --(Acylation)--> Acetophenone** (-COCH3 is a *meta*-director).\n    2.  **Acetophenone --(Nitration)--> 3-Nitroacetophenone** (The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position).\n    3.  **3-Nitroacetophenone --(Bromination)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. In this step, both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) are *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to C5. This is a very straightforward and chemically sound synthesis. However, this simple 3-step synthesis is not among the 7-step options provided. This suggests a more complex route is intended.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Use of a Removable Directing Group**\n    The long sequences involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of nitro to amino), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination) are a strong indicator that an amino group (-NH2) is used as a temporary directing group and is later removed. This is a common strategy for achieving substitution patterns that are not accessible by direct substitution.\n\n**4. Analyze the Provided Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    ii) Bromobenzene is an o,p-director, so nitration yields o- and p-bromonitrobenzene.\n    iii) The next step is Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on p-bromonitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...**\n    i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene (Deamination with H3PO2).\n    The first four steps convert benzene back into benzene, which makes no sense. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ...**\n    i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    iii) The reaction of aniline with CH3COCl/AlCl3 is problematic for Friedel-Crafts acylation. If we assume it protects the amine to form acetanilide (-NHCOCH3), then:\n    iv) Bromination of acetanilide gives p-bromoacetanilide.\n    v) Nitration of p-bromoacetanilide gives 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide.\n    vi & vii) Hydrolysis (a missing step), followed by diazotization and deamination of 4-bromo-2-nitroaniline would yield 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n    This sequence does not produce the target molecule. Thus, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This sequence uses the removable directing group strategy. Let's trace the steps:\n    i) **Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.**\n    ii) **Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone.** Here, the -Br is an o,p-director and directs nitration primarily to its ortho (C4, C6) and para positions. C4 is a likely position. The product is NOT the final target. This nitro group will serve as a precursor to our temporary directing group.\n    iv) **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone --(Fe/HCl)--> 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    v) **3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone.** This is the crucial step. We need to install the final nitro group. In the strong acid medium, the amino group is protonated to anilinium (-NH3+), a meta-director. Let's analyze the directing effects for nitration:\n        *   -COCH3 at C1 (meta-director) directs to C5.\n        *   -Br at C3 (o,p-director) directs to C2 and C6.\n        *   -NH3+ at C4 (meta-director) directs to C2 and C6.\n        While there is conflicting direction, substitution at C5 is plausible. Given that this is the only logical pathway among the options, we assume this step proceeds to give the required product for a \"high-yield\" synthesis context.\n    vi) **3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> ...diazonium salt.** The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    vii) **...diazonium salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\n    This sequence logically constructs the target molecule by installing and then removing a directing group. Although the regioselectivity of step (v) is complex, this option presents the only coherent synthetic plan among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's identify the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position C1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position C3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\nLet's also recall the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3**: Meta-directing and deactivating.\n*   **-Br**: Ortho, para-directing and deactivating.\n*   **-NO2**: Meta-directing and strongly deactivating.\n\nThe challenge is to install these three groups in the correct 1,3,5-pattern. The presence of an ortho,para-director (-Br) among two meta-directors makes a straightforward sequential substitution tricky.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe will evaluate each proposed reaction sequence step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene. (-Br is o,p-director).\n*   ii) Bromobenzene -> p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n*   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation). The ring is strongly deactivated by both the -Br and -NO2 groups. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium salt.\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium salt -> Benzene.\nThis sequence of four steps starts with benzene and ends with benzene, which is a pointless exercise for a synthesis. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-director).\n*   ii) Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone (meta-position is favored).\n*   iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone -> Nitration. The directors are -COCH3 (meta) and -Br (ortho,para).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C2, C4, and C6.\n    This leads to competing directing effects. While the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer is the major product, significant amounts of other isomers are formed (experimental data shows ~49% yield for the desired product). This is not considered a \"high-yield\" synthesis. Furthermore, the subsequent steps (iv-vii) involve reduction of the nitro group and then re-introduction of other groups, which makes no sense if the target molecule was already formed. This option is highly problematic.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence is long and involves the formation and eventual removal of an amino group (indicated by steps vi and vii), a common strategy for achieving \"unnatural\" substitution patterns. Let's trace this path carefully.\n\n*   **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> Aniline.**\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3**. This step is key. Direct Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline is difficult. However, the reagents are appropriate for an N-acylation followed by a **Fries Rearrangement**.\n    *   Aniline + CH3COCl -> Acetanilide (N-acylation).\n    *   Acetanilide + AlCl3 (heat) -> p-Aminoacetophenone (major product via Fries Rearrangement). The acetyl group migrates from the nitrogen to the para position of the ring.\n*   **iv) p-Aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> Bromination.** We are brominating p-aminoacetophenone.\n    *   The substituents are -NH2 (at C4, strong o,p-director) and -COCH3 (at C1, m-director).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the same positions: C3 and C5.\n    *   This reinforcement leads to a clean monobromination at position C3 (ortho to the powerful activating -NH2 group). The product is **3-bromo-4-aminoacetophenone**.\n*   **v) 3-bromo-4-aminoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration.**\n    *   Substituents: -COCH3 (C1, m-director), -Br (C3, o,p-director), -NH2 (C4, o,p-director).\n    *   The -NH2 and -COCH3 groups both direct the incoming -NO2 to position C5. The -Br directs elsewhere (C2, C6).\n    *   The strong directing effect of the -NH2 and -COCH3 groups towards the same position (C5) makes this a highly selective nitration. The product is **3-bromo-5-nitro-4-aminoacetophenone**.\n*   **vi) & vii) Diazotization and Deamination.**\n    *   vi) The primary amine at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt ([_N≡N_]⁺) with NaNO2/HCl.\n    *   vii) The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2).\n\nThe removal of the temporary amino group from C4 yields the final target molecule: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis entire sequence is chemically sound, uses reinforcing directive effects to achieve high yields and selectivity at each key step, and correctly utilizes a blocking/directing group that is later removed. Therefore, it represents the best high-yield synthesis among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a detailed reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position C1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position C3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C5.\n\nThe substituents are located at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means each substituent is **meta** to the other two.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\nThe final product has a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. This pattern is most easily achieved when the substituents already on the ring are meta-directors, as they will direct the next incoming group to the desired position. The presence of an ortho,para-directing bromine atom in a meta-meta relationship with two other groups suggests a careful ordering of steps is required.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence Option\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Puts a -NO2 group on the ring (meta-director).\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** The -NO2 group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2), which is a strongly activating ortho,para-director.\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a positively charged ammonium complex (-NH3+), which is strongly deactivating and prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation of the ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect because step (iii) is not feasible as written.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation puts an acetyl group (-COCH3) on the ring. This group is a meta-director. This is a good starting point.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) to the meta position (C3). The product is 1-acetyl-3-bromobenzene. This aligns with the target structure.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → Nitration:** Now we nitrate a ring with an acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) and a bromo group at C3 (ortho,para-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   This is a case of competing directors. However, in such 1,3-disubstituted systems, the substitution happens at the position that is least deactivated. Position C5 is meta to both the strong deactivating acetyl group and the weak deactivating bromo group. Experimentally, nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone gives the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product. The directing effect of the acetyl group to position C5 governs the reaction outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence successfully synthesize the target molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are superfluous and would modify the product further, but the initial path is correct.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene:** Puts a -Br on the ring (ortho,para-director).\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene:** The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group mainly to the para position (C4), yielding 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n*   **iii) 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene → Acylation:** Now we have -Br at C1 (o,p-director) and -NO2 at C4 (m-director).\n    *   -Br directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   -NO2 directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   Both groups reinforce substitution at position C2 (or C6). The product would be 2-acetyl-1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (or 1-acetyl-2-bromo-5-nitrobenzene), which is the wrong isomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   **i-iv) Benzene → Benzene:** This sequence is i) Nitration, ii) Reduction to aniline, iii) Diazotization, iv) Deamination. The net result of these four steps is the conversion of benzene back into benzene. This sequence is illogical. The subsequent steps (v, vi, vii) form a different isomer, 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option B outlines a viable synthetic route to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The first three steps constitute a logical and efficient synthesis. Although the option includes unnecessary additional steps, it is the only choice that contains the correct pathway.\n\nThe correct sequence is:\n1.  **Acylation** of benzene to form acetophenone.\n2.  **Bromination** of acetophenone to form 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Nitration** of 3-bromoacetophenone to form 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis corresponds to the beginning of sequence B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5 relative to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   Acetyl (-COCH3): meta-director, deactivating.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2): meta-director, strongly deactivating.\n    *   Bromo (-Br): ortho, para-director, deactivating.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern with a mix of meta- and ortho,para-directors suggests that a simple sequential substitution might not be effective and could lead to mixtures of isomers. Often, complex substitution patterns are achieved using a \"directing group\" that is later removed. The presence of reagents for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by reduction (H3PO2) in the options strongly hints at a strategy involving the removal of an amino (-NH2) group. This is a classic synthetic tool known as deamination.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Reaction Options\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n#### **Option B**\ni) `Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene`\nii) `Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline`\niii) `Aniline --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Benzenediazonium chloride`\niv) `Benzenediazonium chloride --(H3PO2)--> Benzene`\nThis sequence of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is a pointless circular synthesis. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n#### **Option D**\ni) `Benzene --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromobenzene`\nii) `Bromobenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene` (para is the major product).\niii) `1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?` This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. Such reactions generally fail or give extremely low yields. This makes the entire sequence not a \"high-yield synthesis\". Therefore, Option D is highly unlikely.\n\n#### **Option C**\ni) `Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene`\nii) `Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline`\niii) `Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?` This reaction is problematic. Aniline reacts with the Lewis acid AlCl3 at the nitrogen atom, deactivating the ring. Acetyl chloride would primarily acylate the nitrogen to form acetanilide, for which a Lewis acid is not typically used. Assuming it's intended to form acetanilide:\n`... --> Acetanilide`\niv) `Acetanilide --(Br2/FeBr3)-->` Bromination of the activated acetanilide ring, likely giving p-bromoacetanilide.\nv) `p-Bromoacetanilide --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` Nitration occurs ortho to the activating -NHCOCH3 group, yielding 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide.\nvi) `4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide --(NaNO2/HCl)--> No reaction`. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2), not an amide (-NHCOCH3). The amide would need to be hydrolyzed first, a step that is missing. Therefore, Option C is chemically flawed as written.\n\n#### **Option A**\nThis option appears long and complex, but let's analyze it carefully, assuming it might involve the formation of a key intermediate that rearranges the substitution pattern correctly.\n\ni) `Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone`\nThe -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n\nii) `Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone`\nThe acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. This is correct.\n\niii) `3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitration Product`\nWe have two deactivating groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1) and -Br (at C3). -COCH3 is a meta-director (directs to C5). -Br is an o,p-director (directs to C2, C4, C6). When directing effects conflict, the least deactivating group often controls the position. Here, -Br is less deactivating than -COCH3. Thus, substitution will be directed by the bromine to the ortho and para positions relative to it. The para position (C6) is sterically favored. This nitration would yield 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone (which can also be named 5-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone). Let's assume this is our product.\n\niv) `5-Bromo-2-nitroacetophenone --(Fe/HCl)--> 5-Bromo-2-aminoacetophenone`\nThe nitro group is reduced to a primary amine.\n\nv) `5-Bromo-2-aminoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitration Product`\nNow we nitrate this molecule. Let's analyze the directing effects on the available positions (C3, C4, C6):\n*   -NH2 group (at C2): A very strong activating o,p-director. It directs to its ortho position C3 and its para position C5 (which is blocked by -Br). Thus, it strongly directs the new group to C3.\n*   -COCH3 group (at C1): A meta-director. It directs to C3 and C5 (blocked). So it also directs to C3.\n*   -Br group (at C5): An o,p-director. It directs to C4 and C6.\nThe powerful activating -NH2 group and the -COCH3 group reinforce each other to direct the incoming nitro group to position C3. This reaction should be highly regioselective.\nThe product is **2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone**.\n\nvi) `2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium Salt`\nThe primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n\nvii) `Diazonium Salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`\nThe diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination). The remaining substituents are the acetyl group (at C1), the nitro group (at C3), and the bromo group (at C5). This is exactly the target molecule.\n\nThis entire sequence is chemically sound and all steps lead logically to the final product with good control over regiochemistry, especially in the crucial nitration (step v) and final deamination steps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A presents a viable, albeit complex, high-yield synthetic route to the target compound. The other options contain chemically flawed steps or lead to incorrect products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
